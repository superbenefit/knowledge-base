In the DAO Primitives framework, an **Ephemeral Cell** refers to a [Cell](artifacts/patterns/cell.md#) that is temporary by design, created to achieve a specific short-term goal or task, after which it dissolves or becomes inactive. Unlike other types of Cells, which are often built for long-term sustained operations, ephemeral Cells are focused on time-limited collaborations.
