# Contributing to SuperBenefit's Knowledge Garden

This guide will help you understand what a knowledge garden is, how ours works, and how you can become part of our collective learning journey. Think of this as your introduction to both the art and craft of digital gardening - where technical tools meet organic growth.

## What is a Knowledge Garden?

A knowledge garden is a collaborative space where ideas grow and evolve through community contribution. Unlike traditional documentation, where content is static and final, our garden is alive with constant growth and change.

Ideas evolve organically through iteration and connection rather than being finalized and static. You might plant a seed of an idea in your drafts, tend it through collaboration in working notes, and eventually see it bloom into a published artifact. Most importantly, the connections between concepts are as vital as the concepts themselves - understanding emerges through collective exploration and curation.

Our knowledge garden serves both as an internal tool for SuperBenefit's collaborative learning and a contribution to the wider knowledge commons. Like any healthy garden, it needs diverse perspectives and regular tending to thrive.

## How Our Garden Grows

### Types of Content

Just as a garden has different areas for different types of plants, our knowledge space has specialized areas for content at various stages of growth:

**[Local Drafts](drafts/drafts.md)** (`drafts/`) are your personal seedbed. Here's where new ideas begin - your private workspace for developing thoughts, conducting initial research, and experimenting with concepts before they're ready for wider collaboration. Think of it as your personal garden plot where you can try things out, using tools like templates and metadata to give structure to your emerging thoughts.

**[Working Notes](notes/notes.md)** (`notes/`) are our community plots, organized by project and topic. Here's where we develop ideas together, document our ongoing work, and build shared understanding through group contribution. These living documents capture our learning process, enriched by tools like Dataview for connecting related concepts and Obsidian's graph view for visualizing relationships.

**[Published Artifacts](artifacts/artifacts.md)** (`artifacts/`) are our mature gardens - carefully tended and ready for visitors. These polished results of our collaborative work represent our best current understanding, reviewed and validated by the community. Creating an artifact isn't about reaching a final, unchangeable state - it's about marking a moment of clarity in our ongoing exploration.

**[Lexicon](tags/tags.md)** (`tags/`) is our gardening vocabulary. As we work together, we develop specific ways of describing ideas and their relationships. The lexicon grows naturally alongside our understanding, helping us communicate more precisely about complex topics. Tags and connections emerge from use, creating an organic map of our knowledge.

**[Link Library](library/library.md)** (`library/`) is like our collection of neighboring gardens. We document external resources that inform our work, adding our own analysis and interpretation. This helps us understand how our garden connects to and builds upon the broader knowledge commons.

### How Knowledge Develops

Ideas grow through natural cycles in our garden. A draft might begin as personal notes from your research, blossom into a collaborative working document as others contribute their insights, and eventually mature into a published artifact that represents our collective understanding.

Our shared language grows similarly - new terms emerge naturally in our work, get refined through discussion and application, and gradually become well-defined concepts in our lexicon. This parallel growth of content and vocabulary helps us develop increasingly sophisticated ways to think and talk about our work together.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Your Environment

#### Install Obsidian

   Obsidian is our primary tool for working with the knowledge garden. It's free, open-source, and works directly with markdown files on your computer. Download it from [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).
   
   It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with Obsidian if you haven't already. It's pretty complex for a note-taking tool, but has some powerful features to help organize knowledge. Plus, working with markdown files and metadata is a useful skill in web3.

#### Clone This Repository

You'll need to clone this repository to work with the knowledge base on your local computer. If you just want to read and/or repurpose the contents, check out the [main Readme page](README.md) for instructions. 

If you want to modify the knowledge base or add new notes, you'll need to interact with the remote repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/). The workflow for syncing and saving files is very simple, but you'll still need a GitHub account and some basic familiarity with Git:

#### Get Repository Access

Reach out to SuperBenefit admins to get access to our repository. They'll help you set up the necessary permissions and share connection details.

### Basic Workflow

Open the vault in Obsidian by selecting File > Open Vault and choosing the repository folder. The GitHub Sync plugin helps you stay current with others' work - pull latest changes before you start, make your edits, then push your changes when done.

### Documents & Metadata

Every document in our garden has both visible content and helpful metadata that helps it find its place in the ecosystem. Our [type definitions](tools/types/readme.md) provide patterns for different kinds of content, but don't let the structure overshadow the substance. The most important thing is capturing and connecting ideas effectively.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Tend Existing Content**
  Start by helping maintain what's already growing. Clarify explanations, update outdated information, fix broken links, or add helpful examples. This helps you learn the garden while making valuable contributions.

- **Plant New Ideas**
  When you're ready, start growing your own ideas in your drafts folder. Let them develop naturally, using our templates and tags to give them structure. Connect your thoughts to related concepts as they mature.

- **Cultivate Connections**
  Some of the most valuable gardening is helping ideas find each other. Create meaningful links between documents, add relevant tags, and help build topic maps that show how different pieces of knowledge relate.

- **Help Others Grow**
  Welcome new gardeners, help them find their way around, and share what you've learned. Review others' work thoughtfully and share your expertise generously.

## Our Guiding Principles

### Growth Over Perfection
Don't wait for perfection - share your work early and let it improve through feedback and iteration. Learning happens through doing, and every contribution can be refined over time.

### Connection Over Organization
Focus on creating meaningful relationships between ideas rather than perfect organizational structures. Use links and tags to help related concepts find each other naturally.

### Clarity Over Complexity
Write for understanding. Provide context, use clear language, and include examples where helpful. Complex ideas can be built from well-explained simple ones.

## Getting Help

When you need assistance:
1. Check existing documentation and templates
2. Ask questions in our community channels
3. Reach out directly to experienced contributors

Remember: every gardener was new once. Don't hesitate to ask for help as you learn to tend our shared knowledge space.
