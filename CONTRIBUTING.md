# Contributing to SuperBenefit's Knowledge Garden

This guide will help you understand what a knowledge garden is, how ours works, and how you can become part of our collective learning journey.

## What is a Knowledge Garden?

A knowledge garden is a collaborative space where ideas grow and evolve through community contribution. Unlike traditional documentation:

A knowledge garden is fundamentally different from traditional documentation. Ideas evolve organically through iteration and connection rather than being finalized and static. Content exists in various stages of development, from early thoughts to polished conclusions. Most importantly, the connections between concepts are as vital as the concepts themselves - understanding emerges through collective exploration and curation.

Our knowledge garden serves as both an internal tool for SuperBenefit's collaborative learning and a contribution to the wider knowledge commons.

## How Our Garden Grows

### Types of Content

Our garden contains several types of content that serve different purposes in our collective knowledge:

**[Local Drafts](drafts/drafts.md)** (`drafts/`) are where new ideas begin. This is your private workspace for developing thoughts, conducting initial research, and experimenting with concepts before they're ready for wider collaboration. Think of it as your personal garden plot where you can try things out.

**[Working Notes](notes/notes.md)** (`notes/`) represent active collaboration spaces organized by project or topic. Here's where we develop ideas together, document our ongoing work, and build shared understanding through group contribution. Working notes are living documents that capture our learning process.

**[Published Artifacts](artifacts/artifacts.md)** (`artifacts/`) contain our refined, public-facing knowledge. These are the polished results of our collaborative work - carefully cultivated ideas that have been reviewed and validated by the community. Artifacts represent our best current understanding of topics and are ready to share with the wider world.

**[Lexicon](tags/tags.md)** (`tags/`) is our shared vocabulary and conceptual framework. As we work together, we develop specific ways of describing ideas and their relationships. The lexicon captures these evolving definitions, ensuring we have a common language for discussion and documentation. It grows organically as our understanding deepens.

**[Link Library](library/library.md)** (`library/`) connects our work to the broader knowledge commons. Here we document external resources that inform our work, along with our analysis and interpretation of them. The link library helps us build on existing knowledge while tracking how external ideas influence our thinking.

### How Knowledge Develops

Ideas in our garden grow through natural progression. A draft might start as personal notes from your research, develop into a collaborative working document as others contribute their insights, and eventually mature into a published artifact that represents our collective understanding.

Similarly, our shared language evolves through use. New terms emerge organically in our work, get refined through discussion and application, and eventually become well-defined concepts in our lexicon. This parallel growth of content and vocabulary helps us build increasingly sophisticated ways to think and talk about our work together.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Your Environment

#### Install Obsidian

   Obsidian is our primary tool for working with the knowledge garden. It's free, open-source, and works directly with markdown files on your computer. Download it from [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).
   
   It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with Obsidian if you haven't already. It's pretty complex for a note-taking tool, but has some powerful features to help organize knowledge. Plus, working with markdown files and metadata is a useful skill in web3.

#### Clone This Repository

You'll need to clone this repository to work with the knowledge base on your local computer. If you just want to read and/or repurpose the contents, check out the [main Readme page](README.md) for instructions. 

If you want to modify the knowledge base or add new notes, you'll need to interact with the remote repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/). The workflow for syncing and saving files is very simple, but you'll still need a GitHub account and some basic familiarity with Git:

#### Get Repository Access

Reach out to SuperBenefit admins to get access to our repository. They'll help you set up the necessary permissions and share connection details.

### Basic Workflow

Open the vault in Obsidian by selecting File > Open Vault and choosing the repository folder. The GitHub Sync plugin helps you stay current with others' work - pull latest changes before you start, make your edits, then push your changes when done.



### Documents & Metadata

Our garden uses markdown files with YAML frontmatter for all content. Check out our [type definitions](tools/types/readme.md) for detailed information about document structure and metadata requirements for different kinds of content.

### File Management Tools

We provide tools to help maintain consistency:

- [Templates](tools/templates/readme.md) for creating new documents
- [Type definitions](tools/types/readme.md) explaining document standards
- Folder notes for navigation and context

See the [tools documentation](tools/readme.md) for detailed instructions on using these resources.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Tend Existing Content**
	- Start by helping maintain and improve what's already in the garden. Clarify explanations, update outdated information, fix broken links, or add helpful examples. This is a great way to familiarize yourself with our content while making valuable contributions.

- **Plant New Ideas**
	- When you're ready to add new content, begin in your drafts folder. Work on your ideas privately until they're ready for collaboration. Use templates to maintain consistency, and don't forget to connect your work to related concepts through links and tags.

- **Cultivate Connections**
	- One of the most valuable contributions is helping ideas find each other. Create meaningful links between related documents, add relevant tags, and help build topic maps that show how different pieces of knowledge connect.

- **Help Others Grow**
	- Guide others in their contributions by reviewing drafts, providing feedback, and sharing your expertise. Welcome new contributors and help them find their place in the garden.

## Our Guiding Principles

### Growth Over Perfection
Don't wait for perfection - share your work early and iterate based on feedback. Learning happens through doing, and every contribution can be refined over time.

### Connection Over Organization
Focus on creating meaningful relationships between ideas rather than perfect organizational structures. Use links and tags to help related concepts find each other naturally.

### Clarity Over Complexity
Write for understanding. Provide context, use clear language, and include examples where helpful. Complex ideas can be built from well-explained simple ones.

## Getting Help

When you need assistance:

1. Check existing documentation and templates first
2. Ask questions in our community channels
3. Reach out directly to experienced contributors

Remember: every gardener was new once. Don't hesitate to ask for help as you learn to tend our shared knowledge space.
