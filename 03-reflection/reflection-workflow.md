# Experiment Reflection Documentation Workflow

This workflow guides the sequential use of reflection documentation tools to create comprehensive reflection documentation from experimental experience. The focus is on the documentation process itself, not on prescribing reflection methodologies.

## Overview: Document Sequence

The reflection documentation process uses four interconnected documents:

    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#ffebee
```

**Document Flow Process:**
1. **Specification** → Defines what complete reflection documentation should contain
2. **Worksheet** → Progressive tool for gathering reflection information
3. **Template** → Structure for organizing worksheet insights into final documentation
4. **Quality Review** → Check final documentation against specification requirements

## Step 1: Review Specification Requirements

**Purpose**: Understand what needs to be captured before beginning information gathering

**Process**:
- Read through [reflection-specification.md](reflection-specification.md) to understand quality standards
- Identify which type of reflection documentation is needed (periodic, milestone, challenge-focused, comprehensive, meta-reflection)
- Note the required elements for your chosen reflection type
- Review quality criteria to understand documentation standards

**Outcome**: Clear understanding of what the final reflection documentation should contain and what quality standards it should meet

## Step 2: Progressive Information Gathering Using Worksheet

**Purpose**: Systematically capture reflection insights using the structured worksheet

**Process**:
- Open [reflection-worksheet.md](reflection-worksheet.md) as your working document
- Complete sections progressively as insights develop (no need to complete all at once)
- Use worksheet sections as prompts for stakeholder conversations, individual reflection, or group discussions
- Fill in relevant sections based on your reflection type and scope
- Reference Discovery Reports and Intervention documentation to avoid duplicating information
- Gather supporting materials (stakeholder quotes, evidence, documentation) for later AI synthesis

**Key Practices**:
- **Progressive Completion**: Fill sections as information becomes available rather than trying to complete all at once
- **Stakeholder Input**: Use worksheet prompts to gather input from different stakeholder perspectives
- **Evidence Collection**: Document specific examples, quotes, and evidence as you gather insights
- **Context References**: Connect to previous documentation rather than re-gathering basic information
- **Supporting Materials**: Collect relevant documents, communications, and artifacts for AI synthesis reference

**Outcome**: Comprehensive worksheet with reflection insights, stakeholder feedback, and learning documentation, plus supporting materials ready for AI-assisted synthesis

## Step 3: Organize Insights Using Template Structure

**Purpose**: Transform worksheet content into coherent reflection documentation using AI assistance

**Process**:
- Complete reflection worksheet with all relevant insights and information
- Gather supporting materials (Discovery Reports, Intervention documentation, stakeholder feedback)
- Use AI prompts to synthesize worksheet content into template sections
- Review and refine AI-generated content for accuracy and completeness

### AI Prompts for Template Development

**Executive Summary Synthesis Prompt:**
```
I need an executive summary for my reflection documentation. Please create this section using my worksheet insights.

Relevant worksheet sections: [paste sections 1, 2, 5 - Context, Outcomes, Learning]

```

**Key Practices**:
- **Complete Worksheet First**: Gather all insights, stakeholder feedback, and evidence in worksheet format before attempting synthesis
- **Provide Full Context**: Include Discovery Reports, Intervention documentation, and supporting materials with AI prompts
- **Use Sequential Prompts**: Work through template sections systematically rather than trying to generate everything at once
- **Review and Refine**: Always review AI-generated content for accuracy and completeness against your actual experience
- **Maintain Human Judgment**: Use AI for synthesis and organization, but apply human insight for final assessment and refinement

**Outcome**: Well-organized reflection document that tells a complete story of learning and insights, created through AI-assisted synthesis of human-gathered information

## Step 4: Quality Review Against Specification

**Purpose**: Ensure final documentation meets quality standards and completeness requirements using AI assistance

**Process**:
- Review AI-generated template content against specification requirements for your reflection type
- Use AI prompts to identify gaps, assess quality, and enhance documentation
- Apply human judgment to verify accuracy and completeness against actual experience
- Ensure documentation serves multiple stakeholder learning and knowledge-sharing purposes

### AI Prompts for Quality Review

**Completeness and Depth Assessment Prompt:**
```
Please review my reflection documentation for completeness and depth against the specification requirements.

My reflection documentation: [paste template content]
Specification requirements: [paste relevant specification sections]

Analyze and provide feedback on:
- What questions would someone encountering this situation for the first time still have?
- Which parts of the story feel incomplete or unclear?
- Where is there insufficient context for understanding not just what happened, but why?
- Which sections need more depth, examples, or evidence?
- Does each section answer the 'so what?' question adequately?
- Is there sufficient context for transferable learning?
- Are insights properly supported with evidence?

Provide specific recommendations for improving completeness and depth.
```

**Honesty and Balance Verification Prompt:**
```
Please assess my reflection documentation for honesty, balance, and accuracy.

My reflection documentation: [paste template content]
Original worksheet data: [paste worksheet for comparison]

Evaluate and provide feedback on:
- Is there a balanced picture of both successes and failures?
- Are there signs of unconscious bias toward positive or negative outcomes?
- Are different stakeholder perspectives adequately represented?
- What parts of the experience might be underrepresented or glossed over?
- Are there claims that need more evidence or different perspectives?
- Are uncertainties and limitations properly acknowledged?
- Are dissenting viewpoints included where relevant?

Identify areas where the documentation could be more honest or balanced.
```

**Learning Transferability Enhancement Prompt:**
```
Please evaluate and improve the transferability of learning in my reflection documentation.
