Human systems function differently at different scales. Understanding these differences is crucial for designing organizational systems that function effectively, regardless of size. This framework identifies four key scales of [group](data/concepts/groups.md) organization, each with its own characteristics, challenges, and best [practices](data/concepts/practices.md):

- [Collaboration Scale](docs/dao-primitives/primitives-framework/concepts/group-scale/collaboration-scale.md)
- [Coordination Scale](docs/dao-primitives/primitives-framework/concepts/group-scale/coordination-scale.md)
- [Constituency Scale](docs/dao-primitives/primitives-framework/concepts/group-scale/constituency-scale.md)
- [Network Scale](docs/dao-primitives/primitives-framework/concepts/group-scale/network-scale.md)

When creating decentralized [networks](data/concepts/networks.md) of autonomous teams, it is important to design for the different group scales that will occur. This way, different [groups](data/concepts/groups.md) across a [network](data/concepts/networks.md) can operate effectively as separate entities, and also [coordinate](data/concepts/coordination.md) together effectively to create a collectively intelligent whole.

## Collaboration Scale

[Collaboration scale](docs/dao-primitives/primitives-framework/concepts/group-scale/collaboration-scale.md) represents the smallest and most fundamental level of [group](data/concepts/groups.md) organization. It is characterized by direct, face-to-face interaction among a small number of individuals (generally under 10) working together towards a shared [goal](data/concepts/purpose.md). Effective collaboration at this scale relies on strong interpersonal relationships, clear communication, and shared understanding.

## Coordination Scale

[Coordination scale](docs/dao-primitives/primitives-framework/concepts/group-scale/coordination-scale.md) involves multiple teams or smaller [groups](data/concepts/groups.md) working together towards a shared [goal](data/concepts/purpose.md), requiring more sophisticated [coordination](data/concepts/coordination.md) mechanisms and communication strategies. This scale typically ranges from 10 to 150 individuals, although this can vary depending on the complexity of the task and the effectiveness of coordination mechanisms.

## Constituency Scale

[Constituency scale](docs/dao-primitives/primitives-framework/concepts/group-scale/constituency-scale.md) encompasses a large and diverse group of stakeholders who share a common interest or benefit from the organization's activities. Unlike smaller scales, this scale emphasizes participation, representation, and collective [decision-making](data/concepts/decisions.md) across a wider [community](data/concepts/community.md).

## Network Scale

[Network scale](docs/dao-primitives/primitives-framework/concepts/group-scale/network-scale.md) represents the largest and most complex level of [group](data/concepts/groups.md) organization, encompassing a system of interconnected organizations or [groups](data/concepts/groups.md) (constituencies) working together towards shared or complementary [goals](data/concepts/purpose.md). This scale is characterized by high levels of interdependence, complex communication flows, and the need for robust mechanisms for [coordination](data/concepts/coordination.md) and [governance](data/concepts/governance.md) across multiple entities.
