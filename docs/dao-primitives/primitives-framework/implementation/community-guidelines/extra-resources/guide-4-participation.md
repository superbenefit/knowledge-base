## Guide 4: Participating in Mediation and Arbitration

**For community members whose conflict has moved beyond direct discourse**

### What to Expect

**Mediation:** Neutral facilitator helps you communicate. You find solutions together.

**Arbitration:** Third party makes binding decision after hearing both sides.

Getting here doesn't mean you failed. It means the issue matters enough to deserve support.

Process typically takes 1-3 sessions for mediation, 2-4 weeks for arbitration. After resolution, follow-up ensures agreements are honored.

### Preparing to Participate

Get clear on needs. What matters most? What do you need to move forward?

Prepare to hear different perspectives. Their experience is real even if you disagree.

**Understand your power:** Do you have more authority, social capital, privilege? Less? How might that affect the process?

Bring support if helpful. A friend present can help you stay grounded.

### During Mediation

Share experience without attacking. Use "When [behavior], I felt [emotion]" not "You are [judgment]."

Listen to understand, not respond. Ask questions.

Stay curious about their perspective. Multiple truths can coexist.

Take breaks when needed. It's okay to pause.

Work toward solutions, not victory. What would address both people's concerns?

### During Arbitration

Present perspective fully and honestly.

Acknowledge where you contributed to conflict. Taking responsibility builds trust.

Trust the arbitrator even when you disagree with their framing. They're trying to see the full picture.

Accept the decision with commitment. This is binding.

### After Resolution

Honor agreements even when difficult. Follow through on what you committed to.

Check in as scheduled. Don't ghost.

Rebuild trust through consistent action. Words matter, but behavior changes things.

**Healing isn't linear:** Relationships may not return to previous state. That's okay.

### Remember

Reaching mediation or arbitration isn't failure. The goal is transformation, not winning. Both truths can be valid.
