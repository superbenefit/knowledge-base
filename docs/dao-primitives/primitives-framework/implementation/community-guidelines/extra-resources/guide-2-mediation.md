## Guide 2: Mediating Conflict

**For community members facilitating when direct discourse hasn't worked**

### Understanding the Role

You facilitate communication, not solve problems. Parties find solutions; you create conditions for that.

**Neutrality about sides, not power:** Don't favor positions, but do name power differences affecting conversation.

**Know limits:** Mediation isn't appropriate for active violence, extreme power imbalances without safeguards, or when one party won't participate meaningfully.

### Preparing for Mediation

Meet each person separately first. Understand perspectives, needs, concerns.

Identify power imbalances: Who has more authority, social capital, privilege? Plan how you'll address it.

Set up accessible space: Can both access it? Privacy adequate? Can people take breaks?

Establish ground rules together: listening, taking turns, breaks, handling overwhelm. Get buy-in.

### Facilitating the Process

Create space for full hearing. Each shares complete perspective uninterrupted. Use talking piece if helpful.

Name power differences when relevant: "I notice person A has formal authority. Let's ensure person B's concerns are heard fully."

Ask questions that build understanding: "What was happening for you?" "What did you need?" "How did that affect you?"

Guide toward shared needs. Help identify where needs overlap, not just where they differ.

**Notice breakthrough moments:** When parties talk directly or generate solutions, get out of the way.

**Manage intensity:** Offer breaks if emotions escalate. Remind about ground rules. Use de-escalation: acknowledge feelings, stay calm, give options.

### Closing or Escalating

Help document agreements: specific actions, who does what, by when.

Set follow-up: When to check in, what happens if agreements aren't honored.

**Recognize when arbitration is needed:** Repeated patterns, entrenched positions, or harm continuing despite mediation.

**Take care of yourself:** Mediation is emotionally demanding. Process with someone not involved.

### Remember

Trust parties to find solutions. Equal treatment isn't always fair treatment. Silence can be powerful.
