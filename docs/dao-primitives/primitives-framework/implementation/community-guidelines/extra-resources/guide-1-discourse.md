## Guide 1: Navigating Conflict Recognition and Discourse

**For community members addressing commitment breaches directly**

### Recognizing When to Engage

**Minor friction vs. breach:** Friction is differences in style, miscommunication, one-time slips. Breaches are repeated patterns, boundary violations, or harm to people or community.

**Check your capacity:** Can you approach with curiosity, not anger? Do you have emotional space? If no, wait or ask for support.

**Early intervention works:** Small conflicts addressed early rarely become large ones. Waiting makes resolution harder.

### Preparing for Discourse

Get specific about the behavior, not character. "You interrupted me three times" not "You're dominating."

Examine your role. What did you contribute? Where were you unclear? Acknowledging your part builds trust.

Identify what you need: apology, changed behavior, understanding. Be clear with yourself first.

**Power dynamics:** If you have more power (institutional, social, privilege), consider how that affects reception. If they have more power, consider bringing support.

### Having the Conversation

Lead with curiosity: "I noticed [behavior]. Can you help me understand what was happening for you?"

Share impact, not judgments: "When you [behavior], I felt [emotion] because [impact]."

Listen to understand. Their experience is real even if different from yours. Ask questions.

Explore needs together. What does each person need? Where are needs compatible?

Generate solutions collaboratively. Ask "What would help?" not "Here's what you should do."

### After the Conversation

**Document agreements:** Write what each person will do. Be specific about actions and timing.

**Follow up:** Check in. Acknowledge improvement. Adjust if needed.

**Move to mediation if needed:** If you've tried twice and patterns continue, it's time for mediation. This isn't failure.

### Remember

Conflict is normal. Multiple truths coexist. The goal is understanding and forward movement, not winning.
