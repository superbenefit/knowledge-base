title: A Community Guidelines Framework
description: A simple framework for creating community guidelines
---

This framework helps communities create three types of agreements: safety boundaries, behavioral expectations, and conflict response processes.

**Why These Guidelines Matter:**

Community guidelines establish safety requirements, mutual expectations, and conflict response plans. They reduce major disruptions by helping members sense and address conflicts proactively. Guidelines should integrate into your workflow naturally rather than adding new overhead -- an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

**How to Use This Framework:**

1. Read this overview to understand the three-part structure
2. Use the implementation guides to create each component (start with Code of Conduct, then Commitment to Accountability, then Conflict Response Plan)
3. Present your draft guidelines to the community for consent-based approval
4. Review and adjust after 3-6 months of use

## The Basic Agreements

These are the basic agreements your community needs for a resilient and adaptable structure:

- **Code of Conduct**: Non-negotiable safety; Violation = removal
- **Commitment to Accountability**: Day-to-day behavior; Breach = conflict process
- **Conflict Response Plan**: Dispute resolution; When conflicts arise

You can add more agreements to your Community Guidelines in the future.

### Code of Conduct

Defines non-negotiable safety boundaries. These are the "house rules" -- if someone breaks them, they no longer have permission to be in the space.

**Quick tip:** Ask "What makes someone immediately unsafe here?"

**See:** Code of Conduct Implementation Guide

### Commitment to Accountability

Sets expectations for how community members interact within the safety boundaries. These are negotiable and should evolve with the community. Breaches trigger the conflict response process.

**Quick tip:** Ask "What makes this space work well?" Use "We commit to..." statements

**See:** Commitment to Accountability Implementation Guide

### Conflict Response Plan

Provides a process for addressing conflicts that arise from breaches of the Commitment to Accountability. It consists of five escalating steps: Recognition, Interpersonal Discourse, Mediation (optional), Arbitration (optional), and Resolution.

**Quick tip:** Start with Recognition + Discourse + Resolution, add Mediation/Arbitration as needed

**See:** Conflict Response Plan Implementation Guide

## Creating Your Guidelines

**If you're starting from scratch:**

1. **Draft Code of Conduct** - Start here. Identify safety boundaries before defining culture.
2. **Draft Commitment to Accountability** - Build on the safety foundation by defining behavioral expectations.
3. **Draft Conflict Response Plan** - Establish how you'll address breaches of commitments.
4. **Present to community** - Get consent-based approval ("Can everyone live with this?")
5. **Implement and iterate** - Use them, learn from experience, adjust after 3-6 months

**Key principles:**

- Keep your Code of Conduct brief and focused on safety only
- Make your Commitment to Accountability concrete with both values and behaviors
- Consider power dynamics at each step -- those with more structural power should create space for others
- The goal is transformation, not punishment

## Common Warning Signs

Watch for these indicators that your guidelines may need adjustment:

- **Guidelines rarely referenced during actual conflicts** -> May not be practical or well-known
- **Same conflicts recurring** -> May need to update Commitment to Accountability or add community practices
- **People leaving without engaging conflict process** -> May not feel safe to do so
- **Consistent escalation to arbitration** -> Earlier steps may need strengthening

## Notes

_This framework is designed to be adapted to your community's specific needs and context. The principles outlined here should be discussed and refined through community input before implementation._
