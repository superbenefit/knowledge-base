---

This document specifies the structure for three templates that communities use to implement their guidelines. Each template should be brief, scannable, and actionable.

---

## Template 1: Code of Conduct

**Purpose:** A standalone document defining non-negotiable safety boundaries.

**Structure:**

![[docs/dao-primitives/primitives-framework/implementation/community-guidelines/agreement-templates/code-of-conduct-template]]

**Template Notes:**

- Keep it brief -- one page if possible
- Use clear, direct language
- Make reporting mechanisms visible and accessible
- Specify exactly what "removal" means in your context

---

## Template 2: Commitment to Accountability

**Purpose:** A living document defining behavioral expectations and culture.

**Structure:**


![[docs/dao-primitives/primitives-framework/implementation/community-guidelines/agreement-templates/commitment-to-accountability-template]]


**Template Notes:**

- Keep it concise and scannable
- Always include the commitment to use the Conflict Response Plan
- Make the review process explicit
- Use "we" language throughout

---

## Template 3: Conflict Response Plan

**Purpose:** A reference document describing the conflict resolution process.

**Structure:**


![[docs/dao-primitives/primitives-framework/implementation/community-guidelines/agreement-templates/conflict-response-plan-template]]


**Template Notes:**

- Keep it concise and scannable
- Make it clear who to contact at each step
- Be specific about your community's mediators/arbitrators
- Include timeframes where relevant

## Implementation Notes

**For all three templates:**

1. **Fill in the brackets:** Replace all [bracketed text] with your community-specific information
2. **Adapt the examples:** Use the provided examples as starting points, but customize for your context
3. **Keep them visible:** Post these where community members regularly access them
4. **Version and date them:** Track changes and review dates
5. **Cross-reference:** Each template should mention the others where relevant

**Storage and access:**

- Keep all three documents in an easily accessible location
- Consider creating a single "Community Guidelines" page that links to all three
- Make them searchable so people can find specific sections quickly

**Maintenance:**

- Review Code of Conduct when safety issues arise or on a regular schedule
- Review Commitment to Accountability regularly as the community learns what works
- Review Conflict Response Plan after each significant conflict or on a regular schedule
- Update dates when documents are revised
