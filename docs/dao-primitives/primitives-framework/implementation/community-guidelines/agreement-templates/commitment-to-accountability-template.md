## What This Is

This document describes how we commit to interact with each other in [Community Name]. These commitments are mutual (we all hold ourselves to them) and negotiable (they evolve as we learn). When disagreements about these commitments arise, we use our Conflict Response Plan.

## Our Commitments

[List your commitments. Each commitment should have the value + how we practice it.]

**We commit to [value].** [One sentence describing how we practice this in concrete terms.]

**We commit to [value].** [One sentence describing how we practice this in concrete terms.]

**We commit to [value].** [One sentence describing how we practice this in concrete terms.]

[Add additional commitments as needed]

**We commit to addressing tensions directly and early.** When something bothers us, we bring it up sooner rather than letting it build.

**We commit to participating in the Conflict Response Plan when needed.** When direct conversation doesn't resolve things, we engage with mediation or other processes.

Breaching a commitment isn't shameful -- it's information that helps us learn and adjust.
