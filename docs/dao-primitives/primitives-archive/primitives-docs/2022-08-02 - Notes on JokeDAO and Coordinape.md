#[[257 Proposal SBP8- DAO Primitive Project
]] 


JokeDAO: [https://www.jokedao.io/](https://www.jokedao.io/) 
- bottom-up, on-chain governance for communities to submit entries and vote on favorites.instead of central teams putting proposals to their community, communities vote on their own ideas.
- how do i set up a contest? just go to "create contest". you can set up the rules for submissions and voting, mint a voting token, and airdrop it to your community.
- how do submissions work? you can set the submission period for whenever you like. during that time, anyone can submit entries responding to a prompt—including links to pics and tweets. let anyone submit—or require them to have a minimum number of your tokens.
- how does voting work? voting starts when submissions end, and you can set voting to end whenever you like. will have a number of ways to handle voting power, including 1 vote per token, vote decay over time, quadratic voting, etc. voting is done with a voting token.
- how do voting tokens work? voting tokens need to be compatible with smart contracts, so recommended  to mint on site. airdrop to your token holders for one-time use—or make them your official token to use in future contests. you can make them non-transferable too.







Coordinape:
- premise is that if you ask everyone in the community who is doing good work, their collective answers will give a better sense of where the value is and who should be most rewarded.
-   steps:
	- Create and fund a Circle of contributors with a set budget and timeframe.
	- At the start of the epoch, each member of the Circle receives a number of GIVE tokens (Determined by the Circle Admin.) When the Epoch ends, all allocated GIVE tokens become locked, and all unallocated GIVE tokens are burned. Budget distribution is then formulated according to the percentage of total GIVE tokens that each member of the circles has received.
	- Distribute Gift Circle and Fixed Payments through Vaults or export them as CSV.
