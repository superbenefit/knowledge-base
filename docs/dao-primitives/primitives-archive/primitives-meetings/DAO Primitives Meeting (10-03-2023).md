	- rather - #[stakeholder governance](data/resources/patterns/participatory-governance.md) doc created. Do we need this for #[community governance](data/resources/patterns/community-governance.md) and #[operational governance](data/resources/patterns/operational-governance.md) as well?

- ## Discussion Topics
	- 
	- Feedback from last RP meeting:
		- Context needed around terminology, especially as names and definitions evolve. 
			- #stakeholder #[stakeholder governance](data/resources/patterns/participatory-governance.md) #[community governance](data/resources/patterns/community-governance.md)  #[dao primitives](docs/dao-primitives/index.md) 
			- #[governance](data/concepts/governance.md) #[reimagining power](docs/rpp/index.md) #[operational governance](data/resources/patterns/operational-governance.md) #web3 #[governance](data/concepts/governance.md) 
		- Assistance needed in onboarding, context gathering, other help to be empowered to contribute. Knowledge gaps and difficulty keeping up with meetings/conversations is challenging.
		- Greater focus on facilitating communication & relationships is needed, along with hands-on assistance needed to help SHG participants onboard to tooling like Discord, Figma, etc.
