Discussion about organizing the documentation for the DAO primitives framework, patterns, etc

# Notes

- Principles

  - Group Scale

  - Group Phase

  - Group State

- Primitives

  - Networks

  - Entities/groups

  - Agreements

Facilitation layer

- Start to work through key questions about purpose and basic agreements (using something like the Ready's OS canvas). This will lead into choosing primitives that will do the job

Primitives

- State (a basket of attestations) - the one primitive that will always be needed. If this stuff is not explicit then everything breaks down.

  - Purpose Practice and Progress

  - Define them, attest to them in some way, and agree.

- DAOs

- Cells

- Roles

- Tasks
