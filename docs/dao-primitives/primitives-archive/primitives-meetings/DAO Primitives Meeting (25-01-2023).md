# Summary

During this meeting on December 5, 2023, several updates were discussed. These included the need for WREEP signs, progress on cell setup documentation, and the near-completion of the Charmverse migration for both WREEP and RPP, with RPP still needing to transfer some documents. The team also mentioned that WREEP assets are ready and awaiting canonical language updates. Key discussion points included the status of the Restorying Power cell, specifically how to best support permissionless squads that may or may not want to become cells. The team proposed creating proto-documents to outline states and agreements, determining the appropriate support level for each squad's state. Additionally, there was a discussion on identifying skills and gaps related to content authoring and git workflows, including version control and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).
