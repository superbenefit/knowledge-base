# OTF Final Report - Web3 and System Transformation Partnership

**Partnership ID:** PP100059  
**Partnership Name:** Web3 and System Transformation  
**OTF Partnership Lead:** Tracey Robertson  
**Report Prepared by:** Tracey Robertson  
**Date:** June 2025

## Partnership Process & Implementation

### 1. What level of engagement did OTF have? What was OTF's role, and what value did OTF bring to the partnership?

**Anticipated level of OTF engagement at the start of the partnership:**

OTF anticipated being part of the broader stakeholder group engaged in community governance and learning with partners, primarily in an observing and learning capacity.

**Actual engagement:**

OTF's engagement aligned closely with initial expectations. They participated as a stakeholder group member, observing the experiments and learning alongside partners. Their role was foundational in two critical ways:

1. **Financial enablement**: OTF's $100,000 contribution provided essential resources that allowed the partnership to pursue ambitious experimentation across three distinct contexts over an 18-month period.

2. **Partnership development**: OTF helped convene and validate the partnership, bringing credibility that enabled collaboration between diverse partners including Community Foundations of Canada, Equality Fund, and grassroots organizations like All In For Sport and ICS.

OTF's value extended beyond direct financial contribution. Their positioning as a learning-oriented funder created psychological safety for honest experimentation and documentation of both successes and failures. This stance encouraged the transparency that became central to the project's knowledge creation approach, allowing partners to document barriers and constraints without fear of appearing unsuccessful.

### 2. What can we learn from the governance and stewardship of this partnership?

The partnership demonstrated several valuable governance insights:

**Multi-stakeholder governance works when properly structured**: The project implemented a governance model that separated stakeholder stewardship from operational execution. This allowed the stakeholder group (including OTF, CFC, Equality Fund) to provide high-level guidance while empowering autonomous "cells" to develop and execute strategy. This structure prevented the bottlenecks common in consensus-heavy governance while maintaining alignment with shared purpose.

**Permissionless participation enables emergence**: The decentralized structure allowed new partners like Women Win to join at multiple points—first as participants in All In For Sport's gatherings, then as collaborators with Equality Fund, then as stakeholder members, and finally as financial contributors. This organic evolution would have been impossible in rigid hierarchical structures.

**Knowledge infrastructure serves as governance mechanism**: The shared knowledge garden and regular sensemaking sessions created distributed coordination without requiring constant synchronous meetings. Partners could remain aligned through documented patterns and shared learning rather than intensive meeting schedules.

**Honest documentation builds trust**: The partnership's commitment to transparently documenting both successes and failures created trust among partners and provided genuine value to the broader sector. Rather than producing promotional materials, the candid reflections on challenges enabled collective learning.

**Resource flexibility matters**: The ability to adapt resource allocation as experiments evolved (evidenced by the budget increases for certain partners) allowed the partnership to respond to emerging opportunities rather than being constrained by initial plans.

---

### 3. What were some of the challenges that the partnership experienced and how did the partners navigate through those challenges?

**Timeline compression**: The initial 18-month timeline proved insufficient for the depth of transformation being attempted. Partners addressed this by securing a three-month extension and adjusting expectations about what "complete" looked like for each experiment, focusing on establishing foundations rather than full implementation.

**Different organizational capacities**: Partners ranged from established foundations with significant resources to grassroots organizations operating with minimal staff. The partnership navigated this by distributing work according to capacity—SuperBenefit provided extensive facilitation and knowledge infrastructure, while smaller partners focused on implementing governance changes within their own contexts.

**Regulatory constraints**: The Equality Fund experiment revealed significant legal and bureaucratic barriers to certain Web3 applications in philanthropy. Rather than treating this as failure, partners documented these constraints thoroughly, providing valuable intelligence for future attempts and advocacy efforts.

**Technical complexity**: Web3 tools proved more challenging to implement than initially anticipated, particularly around user experience and the 6-18 month adoption timeline required. Partners responded by focusing on social infrastructure alongside technical implementation, developing onboarding materials and support systems that acknowledged the learning curve.

**Balancing innovation with stability**: Experiments needed to demonstrate value while maintaining partner organizations' core operations. This was addressed through the cell structure, which allowed innovation work to proceed without disrupting primary activities, and through careful resource allocation that didn't overextend any single partner.

**Coordination across time zones and contexts**: Partners spanned different geographic locations, organizational types, and levels of Web3 familiarity. The knowledge garden infrastructure and asynchronous documentation practices enabled coordination without requiring constant real-time meetings, while regular gatherings provided relationship-building opportunities.

### 4. Write a short (1-2 paragraph) summary of the work that took place (will be used for the annual report)

The Reimagining Power Project brought together diverse partners to explore how Web3 tools and DAO principles could enable more participatory, transparent governance and resource allocation in social impact work. Through three distinct experiments—All In For Sport's community governance transformation, the Institute for Community Sustainability's establishment of on-chain coordination infrastructure, and Equality Fund's exploration of decentralized grantmaking—the partnership developed and tested governance patterns across philanthropic and nonprofit contexts. SuperBenefit provided facilitation, technical expertise, and knowledge infrastructure development, while stakeholder partners including OTF, Community Foundations of Canada, and Equality Fund contributed funding, domain expertise, and strategic guidance.

The 18-month partnership (extended to 21 months) produced comprehensive documentation including a DAO Cell and Community Governance Playbook, four detailed case studies, a public knowledge garden with patterns and implementation guides, and six community gatherings engaging 176 participants. Beyond planned deliverables, the experiments generated unexpected outcomes including All In For Sport's selection for the IOC's Tech365 initiative, ICS's achievement of top 10% ranking in Gitcoin Grants Round 23, the emergence of Women Win as a new partner, and the establishment of Green Pill London as a local node in the global regenerative finance network. The partnership demonstrated that meaningful governance transformation requires patient implementation timelines, strong social infrastructure alongside technical tools, and honest documentation of both successes and constraints.

## Learning Questions

### 5. Using the original learning questions identified at the start of the partnership, share what was learned

| Learning Questions | PI or Partner Qs | Summarize Learnings and Insights | Supporting Documentation |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| How will DAOs impact existing institutions including philanthropy and charity? | Partner | DAOs won't replace existing institutions but rather provide alternative coordination infrastructure that addresses specific limitations. The experiments revealed that traditional charitable structures face legal and operational barriers that prevent direct DAO adoption, but DAO principles (transparency, distributed decision-making, community participation) can be implemented within existing frameworks. The impact is less about wholesale institutional replacement and more about gradually introducing participatory governance patterns that redistribute power while maintaining regulatory compliance. Key insight: The transformation timeline is measured in years, not months, and requires parallel evolution of regulatory frameworks alongside organizational practice. | - Equality Fund experiment case study<br>- Multi-stakeholder governance documentation<br>- Blog: "Reimagining Power: How Web3 Can Transform Social Impact" |
| What are existing models where DAOs coordination and tooling is being used in philanthropy and charity? What can we learn? What more is possible? | PI | Multiple coordination patterns emerged: (1) Community-governed grantmaking (All In For Sport's gatherings program), (2) Transparent treasury management (ICS multisig wallet), (3) Participatory resource allocation (Gitcoin Grants mechanisms), (4) Role-based permissions (Hats Protocol implementation), (5) On-chain impact attestation (Hypercerts). Learning: Effective implementation requires starting with social infrastructure (governance processes, decision-making frameworks) before layering technical tools. The most successful applications focus on solving specific coordination problems rather than pursuing technology for its own sake. What's possible: Deeper integration with global funding networks (as demonstrated by ICS's Gitcoin success), more sophisticated participatory mechanisms, and bridges between local community action and international resources. | - DAO Primitives Framework<br>- Pattern library<br>- AIFS experiment case study<br>- ICS experiment case study |
| What are the governance structures emerging in web3? | PI | Three primary governance patterns emerged: (1) Multi-stakeholder models separating stewardship from operations (RPP's own structure), (2) Cell-based autonomous working groups with clear interfaces (All In For Sport's operational governance), (3) Consent-based decision-making with on-chain verification (ICS's governance infrastructure). The partnership validated that effective Web3 governance combines traditional participatory methods with transparency and verification mechanisms. Key learning: Governance structures must match organizational culture and capacity—there's no universal template. The RPP developed a "primitives" framework allowing organizations to select and combine governance components appropriate to their context rather than adopting pre-packaged solutions. | - RPP Governance Case Study<br>- DAO Cell and Community Governance Playbook<br>- Multi-Stakeholder Governance Guide |
| What are the models for how capital can be mobilized toward transformative outcomes? | Partner | Several capital mobilization models showed promise: (1) Quadratic funding mechanisms (Gitcoin Grants) enabling small contributors to signal priorities matched by larger pools, (2) Retroactive public goods funding recognizing completed work rather than requiring upfront proposals, (3) Community treasuries with transparent allocation (All In For Sport), (4) Direct peer-to-peer transfers bypassing institutional intermediaries (explored but limited by regulatory constraints in Equality Fund experiment). The key learning: Capital mobilization requires trusted relationships and shared context before technical infrastructure adds value. Organizations like ICS succeeded by embedding in existing networks (Green Pill London) that provided legitimacy and connection to funding sources. | - ICS Gitcoin Grants success documentation<br>- Equality Fund experiment findings<br>- Knowledge garden articles on funding mechanisms |
| Where might web3 provide the greatest leverage toward change/better outcomes? | PI | Web3 provides leverage in four specific areas: (1) Transparent coordination across geographic and organizational boundaries (demonstrated by international collaborations through All In For Sport and Green Pill network), (2) Reducing transaction costs for international resource flows (though regulatory barriers remain significant), (3) Creating verifiable records of community decision-making and resource allocation that build trust with external funders, (4) Enabling participation in global funding mechanisms that reward collaborative patterns and documented impact. Greatest leverage appears where traditional intermediaries create bottlenecks or where geographic distance prevents relationship-building—Web3 infrastructure enables coordination at scales that were previously inaccessible to grassroots organizations. | - AIFS IOC Tech365 selection documentation<br>- Women Win partnership emergence<br>- Green Pill London network connections |

## Results and Impact

### 6. Reflect on each result identified at the start of the partnership

| Results | Results Achieved or Advanced / Change Observed |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Increased community engagement via the All In For Sport DAO prototype and the Reimagine Institute DAO Prototype. More resources (basketball courts) flowing to the community via the piloting of the All in for Sport DAO | **EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS**<br><br>AIFS: Implemented governance separation enabling 176 participants across 6 community gatherings. Established relationships with 25 organizations across 16 countries through IOC Tech365 selection. Community decision-making now embedded in operational structure through passed governance proposals. Basketball court resources flowing through community-governed allocation processes.<br><br>ICS: Established functioning governance infrastructure including multisig wallet, role management via Hats Protocol, and transparent decision-making processes engaging 4 active participants. Achieved top 10% ranking in Gitcoin Grants Round 23, securing resources through community validation mechanisms. Launched Green Pill London chapter connecting local sustainability work to global regenerative finance networks, creating access to previously unavailable funding and collaboration opportunities. |
| Increased understanding of how DAO principles and structures can be used by investors/funders to reimagine relations of power and redistribute resources to communities through two different models (Equality Fund DISCO and All for Sport DAO). Increased understanding of how participatory grantmaking can be done at scale and how DAOs might support such efforts. Increased understanding of how the DAO model can be used to center communities and grow accountability in traditional placed-based organization. | **SUBSTANTIALLY ACHIEVED WITH IMPORTANT QUALIFICATIONS**<br><br>Equality Fund: Comprehensive discovery phase revealed critical barriers and prerequisites for Web3 adoption in philanthropic sector. Key finding: Current regulatory and operational constraints prevent many desired applications, but documentation provides framework for future experimentation and advocacy. Understanding deepened around where barriers exist (last-mile delivery, local banking restrictions, compliance requirements) rather than assuming unlimited possibility.<br><br>AIFS: Demonstrated how community-governed allocation can work at scale through gatherings program. Validated that participatory approaches require strong social infrastructure and cultural alignment before technical tools add value. Showed how traditional organizations can incrementally adopt DAO principles without wholesale transformation.<br><br>ICS: Proved that small organizations can implement transparent governance and access global networks through proper infrastructure. Demonstrated how local community work can connect to international resources while maintaining autonomy. Validated that on-chain coordination enables accountability without requiring sophisticated technical understanding from all participants.<br><br>Cross-cutting: The partnership established that "reimagining power relations" requires parallel work on regulatory frameworks, organizational culture, and technical infrastructure. Quick wins are possible in transparency and participation, but deeper power redistribution faces structural barriers requiring longer-term systemic change. |

### 7. So what? What is the importance or significance of this partnership and the results that were achieved or advanced?

The partnership's significance lies in positioning social impact organizations not as technology adopters but as leaders shaping how emerging Web3 technologies, DAOs, and decentralized coordination infrastructure serve community empowerment and justice. At a moment when blockchain, cryptocurrency, and decentralized governance are rapidly maturing, nonprofits and foundations cannot afford to simply observe from the sidelines—they must actively participate in defining how these powerful new coordination tools align with social purpose rather than extractive models. This partnership demonstrated that grassroots organizations and community-focused funders can implement sophisticated governance innovations, access global funding networks, and pioneer new ways of working that redistribute power rather than concentrate it.

**Sector-level impact**: The comprehensive knowledge products—playbook, case studies, pattern library—enable other organizations to pursue similar transformations without repeating the 18-month discovery process. The documented evidence that certain Web3 applications face insurmountable regulatory barriers (particularly in international grantmaking) saves the sector from wasting resources on approaches that cannot succeed under current frameworks, while simultaneously providing evidence for advocacy efforts.

**Network effects**: The partnership demonstrated that coordination infrastructure creates unexpected value beyond immediate participants. All In For Sport's IOC selection, Women Win's emergence as a partner, ICS's Gitcoin success, and the Green Pill London chapter all resulted from network connections enabled by the experiments rather than from planned deliverables. This validates that governance transformation work generates relationship and opportunity building platforms, not just organizational improvements.

**Practical demonstration**: The experiments proved that small organizations can implement sophisticated governance approaches without requiring extensive resources or technical expertise, provided appropriate infrastructure and support exists. ICS's success as a grassroots organization challenges assumptions that Web3 governance requires significant scale or funding.

**Honest assessment**: Perhaps most significantly, the partnership established precedents for transparent documentation of both successes and failures in social innovation. The Equality Fund experiment's thorough documentation of barriers provides more value than promotional claims would have, creating collective learning resources that prevent sector-wide resource waste.

**Bridge building**: The initiative successfully connected Web3 practitioners with traditional nonprofit and philanthropic communities, creating cross-pollination that benefits both groups. The 176 participants in gatherings and multiple learning cohorts represent relationship infrastructure that continues generating collaboration beyond the formal partnership period.

### 8. Has the sector or field of work changed over the course of the partnership?

The 18-month partnership period coincided with dramatic environmental shifts that transformed context from experimental exploration to urgent necessity:

**Mainstream Web3 adoption**: Cryptocurrency and blockchain moved from niche interests into everyday conversation, creating new openness among traditional nonprofits and funders toward decentralized solutions. Organizations that previously dismissed Web3 as speculative began recognizing practical applications for transparency, coordination, and community empowerment.

**Rise of AI and data sovereignty concerns**: The explosive normalization of artificial intelligence and large language models during this period heightened awareness of data privacy, ownership, and control—issues where blockchain technology offers critical infrastructure. While AI and Web3 may seem distinct, they're deeply interconnected: blockchain provides essential mechanisms for data sovereignty, verifiable provenance, and decentralized governance that will be crucial as AI becomes embedded in social impact work. Social purpose organizations increasingly recognize they need both technologies, and the implementation pathways for Web3 governance directly inform how nonprofits can maintain agency and values alignment as AI capabilities expand.

**Maturation from techno-solutionism**: The sector evolved past "blockchain will solve everything" thinking toward recognizing that coordination infrastructure requires both social and technical innovation. This shift validated the partnership's emphasis on governance patterns and relationship building alongside technical tools.

**Realistic timeline recognition**: Growing sector awareness emerged that meaningful Web3 adoption requires 6-18 months minimum, not the rapid sprints common in Web3 spaces. This timeline understanding vindicated the partnership's patient approach while helping other organizations avoid unrealistic expectations.

**Institutional instability**: Growing political and economic uncertainty increased demand for resilient, community-controlled systems that can function independently of centralized institutions. Communities began actively seeking decentralized infrastructure rather than requiring convincing about its value—a fundamental shift from supply-push to demand-pull dynamics.

**Knowledge infrastructure legitimacy**: Knowledge gardens, pattern libraries, and community-governed innovation networks transitioned from experimental concepts to recognized coordination mechanisms. The partnership's knowledge garden approach influenced how other communities structure distributed learning.

**Cross-sector bridge building**: Collaborations between Web3 practitioners and traditional social impact organizations became more common and sophisticated, moving beyond simple education toward genuine co-creation. The partnership contributed to this evolution by demonstrating working models and honest documentation of challenges.

The convergence of these shifts positioned the partnership's coordination infrastructure work at the center of urgent conversations about community resilience and democratic participation. What began as experimental exploration became essential preparation for navigating uncertain institutional landscapes.

### 11. Additional Comments

This partnership demonstrates the value of patient, relationship-focused approaches to innovation in the social sector. By prioritizing coordination infrastructure alongside technical implementation, the initiative created lasting foundations for how nonprofits can engage with Web3 technologies—transparent treasury management, community-governed resource allocation, and decentralized coordination mechanisms that enable rather than constrain mission-driven work.

The emergence of unexpected outcomes—IOC selection, Women Win partnership, Gitcoin success, Green Pill chapter—validates that Web3 governance experiments serve as relationship-building platforms connecting organizations to global networks and funding opportunities previously inaccessible through traditional structures. These developments occurred because the decentralized coordination model enabled organic participation evolution rather than constraining involvement through rigid hierarchies.

The partnership's comprehensive knowledge products—particularly the pattern library, DAO primitives framework, and multi-stakeholder governance documentation—provide tested pathways that enable social impact organizations to implement blockchain-based coordination infrastructure appropriate to their contexts. This democratization of Web3 governance knowledge represents significant contribution to the sector's capacity to lead rather than follow in shaping how emerging technologies serve community empowerment.

The 21-month timeline (including extension) proved appropriate for the depth of transformation attempted. The partners' willingness to advocate for realistic implementation timelines reflects understanding that meaningful technology adoption in mission-driven organizations requires building social infrastructure alongside technical capabilities—a maturity that serves the broader sector's engagement with Web3, DAOs, and related emerging technologies.
