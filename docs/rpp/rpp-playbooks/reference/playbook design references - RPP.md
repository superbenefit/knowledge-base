**Playbook projects**

1. Celo’s Regenerative Finance Playbook

   •	Overview: Celo is a blockchain platform focusing on financial inclusion and regenerative finance (ReFi). Their playbook emphasizes how to integrate regenerative financial systems into Web3 ecosystems using decentralized governance models. The platform provides tools for tokenization, decentralized finance (DeFi), and governance, aligning financial incentives with sustainability. •	Playbook Focus: •	Tools for creating carbon-negative decentralized applications (dApps). •	Frameworks for tokenized voting and governance systems, designed to drive climate-positive actions. •	Modules for decentralized treasury management that funds regenerative projects. •	Source: Celo

2. The Commons Stack Playbook
