# Meeting Agenda

### 1. Review Playbook discovery report 

1. Work through the report at a high level collecting insights/comments that people have

2. Note - do not fall into long discussion, just clarify if needed and capture insights that people have already thought about. 

3.  


## 2. Discuss planning for playbooks project 

- Document structure  

- Who are we coordinating and communicating with?

- How might the plan for Playbooks evolve from what is in the discovery report?

- Playbooks Stewards role - what might a playbooks steward role look like? When will be need to create one?

- **Who is interested in taking playbooks forward?**

  - **Rowan is keen**

  - **Filsan - interested but will get back after some thinking**

  - **Rather is keen**

  - **Heenal is a maybe, we will discuss.** 

  - **We can discuss in the OS stewards meeting. Filsan welcome to join or we can find a different time to chat**


## 3. Immediate next steps

- Capacity / Resource Planning?

- Pattern / Clarity planning?

- Rather and Rowan will have a look at the  bounty and work out what needs to be done on this. 
 

**Objective** 

**Stakeholders**

Seem to cover things off well

**Risks** 

- Budget - how much can we contribute towards the playbook project. This will be an important factor in the design/strategy

- We will need to network playbooks in tightly with other activity to make everything work. This means that we can't have playbooks off on their own. The budget and planning needs to be part of the overall project budget and plan. There needs to be a balance of engaging outside contributors as well as keeping the playbooks work tightly tied in with the other project work

- If we can get to a place where we can identify what skills and capacities we have and map out what we need from community contributors

- We need to focus tightly on specific use-cases - not general ones where things are too vague - this risk will be managed mostly in pattern crafting 

- There is a difference in the levels of clarity across the different experiments

- Playbooks we are committed to **DAOs and community governance + DAOS and Philanthropy governance** 


**Recommendations** 

- We think "hackathon" is being used more as an internal design sprint kind of thing. This would include the core team anyone who is working on playbooks. 

- What - 

- Possibly use [quest chains](https://app.questchains.xyz/optimism/how-to-build-a-network-for-impact) for managing playbooks - to take people on an onboarding journey into using the playbooks. [Here](https://metagame.wtf/academy) are some design examples of gamified playbooks 

- 30 day playbooks challenge 

 https://challenge.metagame.wtf/

**Project Plan**

- It makes sense and It's going to shift as the team works up their own plan. This is a good starting template. 

- It seems like incentives can be useful to get people to contribute patterns

- 

- How do Patterns and Playbooks come together? Or are worked on separately?  Getting these nicely defined is an important starting point.  

- How are we planning for things like - presentation and publishing  of visual assets (we will need a template etc). We can't wait until the end to create these things, we need to do them in parallel so that they are ready when we need them

> **Playbook Discovery Report Review**
>
> - The meeting began with a review of the Playbook Discovery Report, which was well-structured and digestible.
>
> - The report broke down the project into several key components, including developing and publishing playbooks, facilitating participatory budgeting and community treasury management, creating self-sustaining ecosystems of responsible Web3 citizens, and enhancing playbook production.
>
> - Stakeholders for the project were identified.
>
> **Key Risks and Recommendations**
>
> - Team capacity needs to balance integrating playbooks tightly with the rest of the project while also bringing in external expertise and capacities.
>
> - Carving off a separate playbooks budget and outsourcing it entirely would not be ideal; leveraging the decentralized nature of the project is preferred.
>
> - Focusing on specific use cases rather than vague generalities is crucial for the playbooks to offer concrete, actionable information.
>
> - Varying levels of clarity across different experiments within the project need careful consideration for integration with playbooks.
>
> - An internal hackathon or design sprint was discussed as a potential starting point for playbook development instead of a public event.
>
> **Project Plan Review**
>
> - The project plan outlined in the discovery report provides a good starting point despite expected changes.
>
> - Steps include conducting a hackathon, creating a simple version of a playbook, building on existing resources, maintaining playbooks, conducting retrospectives, and developing a communication strategy.
>
> **Defining Playbook Structure**
>
> - Ongoing work includes researching playbook components to understand how playbooks are used globally and how to build RPP's version.
>
> - Research will cover playbooks as strategic plans, patterns as standard solutions, and practices as methods.
>
> **Interest in Playbook Development**
>
> - Discussion on who would take playbooks forward either as core contributors or part of a wider community took place.
>
> - Rather expressed willingness to continue working on playbook development, while Filsan showed interest but needed to manage other commitments before fully committing.
>
> **Relationship Between Playbook Development and Other Initiatives**
>
> - Much of the pattern work has been shifted to the 'Reimagining Power' project.
>
> - There is a need to clearly define what constitutes a pattern versus a playbook.
>
> **Planning for Visual Assets and Publishing Formats**
>
> - Planning for visual assets and publishing formats well in advance is important.
>
> - Consideration of templates for PDF versions of playbooks and other visual elements that may take time to produce is necessary.
>
> - This planning needs to be factored into the process to ensure assets are ready when needed.
>
> **Next Steps for Playbook Development**
>
> - Agreement to move forward with playbook development was reached.
>
> - Next steps include setting up a framework for playbook components research in the knowledge garden and breaking down tasks into manageable pieces for wider participation.
>
> - Continuing to update the core team on progress and creating opportunities for asynchronous work and finite, fixed tasks to accommodate team members with limited availability is emphasized.
