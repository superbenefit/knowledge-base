# Introduction 

This Discovery Report summarizes the findings from two rounds of interviews conducted with key members of the SuperBenefit Reimagining Power Project (RPP) team. The purpose of these interviews was to gather insights and align the team's understanding of the project's current state, goals, and potential challenges, with a specific focus on the development and operationalization of Playbooks. 

The report is divided into four sections:

1. Discovery Interview Purpose & Approach, which outlines the interview process and questions

2. Interview Summaries, which provides an overview of the responses from each round of interviews

3. Themes & Insights, which highlights the key themes that emerged from the interviews and their implications for the project

4. Visioning & Planning Prep, which outlines the next steps and pre-work required for the upcoming Visioning & Planning session.

# Section 1: Discovery Interview Purpose & Approach Discovery

Interviews are a crucial component of this engagement, as they facilitate alignment and surface sufficient context from key SuperBenefit members on the Reimagining Power Project (RPP) in order to set up for successful project execution. These interviews help to develop a deep understanding of the SuperBenefit’s current state, challenges, goals, and expectations pertaining to (RPP). By conducting thorough discovery interviews, we can identify focus areas, uncover potential risks and roadblocks to success, and gain a clearer picture of RPP’s scope and requirements. The insights gained from these interviews form the foundation for Phase 1, which is focused on developing a clear project plan that is tailored to deliver measurable, high impact outcomes (specifically, Playbooks) for RPP.

We conducted two rounds of Discovery interviews. Round 1 was focused on DAO primitives, with participation Naan, rathermercurial, and Rowan. Round 2 was focused on stakeholder engagement and domain expertise, with participation from Filsan, Heenal, and Michelle.

Discussion during each round was framed around the following questions:

- Why is the Reimagining Power Project important? 

- Why are we dedicating time, attention, and intention to it? In a few sentences, describe the current state of the project

- How does the current state compare its ideal state in your opinion? How do Playbooks fit into the broader project goals? 

- What are the elements of a great Playbook? (Be as general or specific as you'd like here) What are the 1-2 biggest risks for successful Playbook creation and operationalization?

- Fast forward two months. 

- Where do you want the Reimagining Power Project to be? What is the state of Playbooks in the context of the project?

The next section summarizes discussions from each respective round. 

# Section 2: Interview Summaries 

Here we look at the contents of interview discussions in terms of the framing questions.

## Why is the Reimagining Power Project important? Why are we dedicating time, attention, and intention to it?

**_Round 1 response summaries_**

Naan stressed the importance of RPP to move beyond theoretical discussions and implementing, testing, and improving upon practical solutions. RPP and Playbooks are an opportunity to make Web3 and DAO concepts and tooling understandable and implementable for people outside of SuperBenefit.

RatherMercurial described RPP as a vehicle to improve participatory budgeting and community treasury management in a way that is coherent and practically useful. Specifically, through Playbooks, RPP stakeholders can drive meaningful, practical outcomes that are relevant to the context in which they are consumed and applied, illustrating what it means to be “Responsible Web3 Citizens”.

Rowan described RPP as a container for experimenting with DAOs to facilitate more equitable decision-making processes, avoiding traditional centralizations of power. Using DAO primitives, RPP unlocks building infrastructure to enable a future where power structures don’t replicate past inefficiencies, focusing on DAOs and participatory governance.

**_Round 2 response summaries_**

Filsan described how RPP allows us to reimagine how we can deliver impact by reconstructing the systems in which we operate. This is rooted in a recognition that systems people work in often get in the way of delivering impact using DAO principles and tooling.

Heenal described RPP as an opportunity to combine theory and practice. More specifically, RPP is the opportunity to showcase what the SuperBenefit team has been researching for 18+ months by developing solutions, such as playbooks, to crystallize this in the real world.

Michelle described RPP’s potential to retrofit governance and financial coordination mechanisms enmeshed in traditional nonprofit and philanthropic organizations. Recognizing that this is no small feat, RPP is an opportunity to reshape this paradigm to not only show what the project can tangibly deliver in the short-term, but help RPP stakeholders get to that “aha!” moment and see the practical vision of RPP.

## In a few sentences, describe the current state of the project

Both Round 1 and Round 2 discussions had a common thread pertaining to RPP’s current state: we’re ready to put theory and research into meaningful practice. For the past 18+ months the team has given deep and thoughtful consideration to existing power structures, inefficiencies in existing systems, and spec’d out solutions for how Web3 technologies can facilitate more efficient and equitable participatory budgeting and community treasury management processes in the nonprofit and philanthropic sectors.

The pieces of the project are all there. Now it’s time to put those together and deliver practical solutions. As Filsan indicated, it’s time to hit the “go” button.

RPP has a **9.5 ETH** budget thanks to a grant from a benefactor. A large part of the pitch to receive this grant was the successful delivery of Playbooks so that is a key focus of the current state. As we continue to develop and implement the project roadmap, we need to consider the practical outcomes Playbooks seek to achieve as well as how Playbooks fit into the other RPP pillars - namely Salons and a web-based platform.

## How does the current state compare its ideal state in your opinion? 

RPP’s ideal state is a self-sustaining program that unlocks the building energy and activates, as Michelle described, an “ecosystem of the willing”. This ecosystem of the willing is composed of individuals and organizations who see the potential of Web3 technologies as a way to change the existing power dynamics and inefficient processes, especially pertaining to participatory budgeting and community treasury management in nonprofit and philanthropic contexts.

This ideal state is achieved by activating who RatherMercurial calls “Responsible Web3 Citizens”. That is, individuals who are sufficiently versed with Web3 tech and tools can create an infrastructure that abstracts away Web3 complexities, using it as a base layer on which to build and deliver components for systemic transformation to better align with organizational goals.

This is no easy feat. Comparing RPP’s current state to its ideal one, a few key focus areas emerge.

A first focus area is the overall narrative of RPP. This is crucial storytelling work to paint the picture of the world RPP seeks to empower. It means having accessible language that resonates with stakeholders. It means developing case studies that illustrate RPP’s impact. It means describing the conceptual and technical primitives foundational to RPP is such a way that abstracts complexity without oversimplifying.

A second focus area is improving cross-workstream collaboration. Some interviewees expressed challenges around knowing what’s going on in other workstreams and how this fits into the overall RPP vision. In order to achieve the ideal state, we have an opportunity to improve cross-workstream communication and collaboration. This is especially important as the SuperBenefit community grows. Specific focus areas here include:

- Identifying areas of information asymmetry Improving workstream onboarding 

- Codifying a unifying roadmap with clear deliverables and cross-functional dependencies

- Continuing to improve synchronous share-outs 

- Actively maintaining the RPP knowledge base in CharmVerse 

- Externalizing workstream-specific accountabilities

Related to the above, a third focus area is around defining and measuring success. Many interviewees indicated that, despite the high-quality discussion and work done to date, it is hard to know what there is to show for it. In order to improve this (which we will dig into in Phase 1) we can develop clearer milestones and metrics to measure our progress and success. 

Specific KPIs to consider are:

- # of Playbooks published

- Playbook usage metrics

- # of organizations using Playbooks

- # of Salons hosted

- Attendance per Salon

- Community success metrics, such as:

  - # of new community members

  - Time to onboard community members (with clear measures of what successful onboarding looks like)

  - Workstream-specific community member metrics

A fourth focus area is around developing user personas. This work informs which Playbooks to prioritize, the degree of depth included, specifying target audience and Playbook-specific outcomes, etc. By developing Playbooks around specific user personas, using Playbook primitives alluded to in the first focus area, we will create a core competency that allows us to scale Playbook publication more effectively.

A fifth focus area is experiments. Experimentation was a common theme in all interviews. Despite this though, there wasn’t a common and clearly articulated definition of the types of things we want to experiment with. It is worthwhile to spend time driving alignment on the experiments we are running, what variables we are controlling for, and the hypotheses we are testing. Given the RPP team is a consumer of RPP outputs, a starting point for experimentation should be how the RPP team is experimenting on itself. These findings can then be extrapolated to run experiments for RPP stakeholders, and will also inform content for publication.

A sixth focus area is the actual Playbook execution – it’s doing the thing. The focus areas described above will help streamline Playbook execution. At the end of the day though, we need to publish the Playbooks. The ideal state of RPP is one where Playbooks take on a life of their own and are entirely managed by the community. This is certainly achievable. Getting there, though, means publishing Playbooks and getting feedback.

## How do Playbooks fit into the broader project goals? 

All interviewees shared consensus around Playbooks as part of RPP’s broader goals. Namely, Playbooks are RPP’s keystone. Playbooks are the consumable artifacts for RPP stakeholders to use in their organizations. RPP is about reimagining power and Playbooks are about illustrating that imagination for implementation.

Playbooks will have a bi-directional relationship with Salon programming. That is, Playbook feedback will inform Salon topics. And Salon feedback will inform Playbook priorities and contents. Moreover, Playbooks will live on a web-based platform for users to access for self-service adoption.

## What are the elements of a great Playbook? (Be as general or specific as you'd like here) 

Naan summed it up well when they emphasized Playbooks as actionable, accessible, and not overly complex.

Round 1 interviewees discussed Playbooks as products. Like any great product, Playbooks need to help the user achieve their goals (actionable), easy to understand (accessible), and easy to use (not overly complex). We further explored this notion of Playbooks as products in Round 2. More discussion on Playbooks as products is Section 3, Theme 4.

## What are the 1-2 biggest risks for successful Playbook creation and operationalization? 

TODO: We didn’t talk too much about risks in either round of interviews. This will be a topic of discussion during the Visioning & Planning session.

## Fast forward two months. Where do you want the Reimagining Power Project to be? What is the state of Playbooks in the context of the project?

**_Round 1 response summaries_** Naan reiterated the importance of creating something that has true utility to RPP stakeholders. In order to get there, we need to critically reflect upon the things we’ve done so far and apply the lessons we’ve learned. This will manifest in Playbooks that are accessible and purpose-built for well-defined audiences and use cases, enabling actionable and measurable outcomes. These will not only have practical applications but also will be designed in such a way that we can perform tests and run experiments to measure and iterate upon Playbook efficacy.

RatherMercurial noted that that RPP team was centered in the pitch to getting grants. As such, it is incumbent upon us to deliver upon our commitments. We will drive systems transformation by empowering “Responsible Web3 Citizens” to contribute to Playbooks that abstract away the complexity of Web3 tech and help with tool selection. This will be founded on strong DAO primitives. Namely, taking the conceptual primitives we’re defining and implementing those in tech that is composed of small packages of tools that accompany Playbooks. This tech piece will be bolstered by the wider organizational piece, which recognizes that every org is different. The Playbooks we produce will require little hand holding such that stakeholders can use them in a self-service fashion.

Rowan envisions implementing a solid infrastructure that reflects RPP’s values and goals, enabling a future where power structures don’t replicate past inefficiencies and inequities. Initially, we will focus experiments with DAOs to facilitate more equitable decision-making processes. Our first batch of Playbooks will target knowledgeable Web3 facilitators working on participatory governance. Based on the feedback and insight we get from engaging with this audience, we can create a plan to gradually expand Playbook accessibility to a broader audience.

**_Round 2 response summaries_** Filsan discussed the existing “bustling feelings of energy” around RPP and highlighted harnessing this energy to further cultivate community and empower action. This means growing the ecosystem (especially in Canada, where people are especially open to and aware of Web3 things), sparking curiosity, onboarding contributors, and presenting RPP to the world in a way that is resonant despite the fact that we’re creating something different than what folks are used to reading. This will be enabled by getting workstreams to a place where they are empowered to implement new things and run experiments that are aligned with the wider RPP vision.

Heenal emphasized growing the community around RPP, progressively decentralizing project ownership away from the core team and empowering the wider SuperBenefit community and RPP stakeholders such that Playbooks take on a life of their own. In order to achieve this, we will have great Playbook branding, we will be aligned on which experiments we are running, and we will onboard people who share in RPP’s vision and are eager to rally around it. To summarize, “it feels like we are engaged in the world.”

Michelle described a vibrant “ecosystem of the willing”.  We will build off of the energy that is currently behind RPP in order to publish Guides, Playbooks, and Case Studies. We will thoughtfully cultivate “more spaciousness” for experimentation and meaningful production, without sacrificing cross-workstream alignment. This will lead to community growth, outcomes, and new funding opportunities.

# Section 3: Themes & Insights 

This section highlights key themes that emerged from Discovery interviews. It discusses each theme and the insights derived from it, respectively. We will use these insights to inform the Visioning & Planning session such that we can develop a clear and detailed roadmap for Phase 1.

## Theme 1: Activating the energy 

All interviewees noted the energy building around RPP. This energy is the culmination of 18+ months of research and brainstorming. Moreover, the energy is building with the growing community.

In order to successfully activate this energy and bring RPP’s vision to life, we should consider the following insights: 

- Information asymmetries are a limiting factor. Cross-workstream collaboration as well as wider stakeholder engagement is constrained by the proverbial right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing. By creating better communication and information sharing channels, the respective workstreams will be able to play into their strengths with confidence that they are working towards a broader vision in sync. 

- Onboarding has some friction. New community members and ecosystem partners bring a new energy and perspective to the project. However, friction points during onboarding limit our ability to harness and channel that energy. By identifying and removing friction points to the onboarding process, we can work toward shipping more Playbooks such that they can eventually take on a life of their own. 

- A moment of documented reflection will catalyze future success. The work-to-date provides us with ample lessons and learnings. What worked well? What could we have done better? By taking a moment to reflect on what we’ve done so far, and thoughtfully articulating the lessons we’ve learned, we will position ourselves for future success. 

## Theme 2: Telling the story 

Systematic and organizational transformation is delicate and nuanced. We are addressing deeply-entrenched biases people hold (both consciously and subconsciously), introducing cutting-edge technology, and changing people’s orientation toward power and governance. This is big and important stuff.

Like any big and important thing that challenges people’s habits and beliefs, it is crucial to frame solutions in a way the people understand and identify with. Key insights from interviewees will help us tell to RPP story: 

- Strong primitives, both conceptual and technical, are like the paint with which we can color the RPP picture. It is crucial that the RPP core team is aligned on the primitives that buttress RPP and the Playbooks created by its contributors. This creates a mosaic that is a shared frame of reference, whose components can be adapted, remixed, and built upon to publish impactful Playbooks in a way that all contributors understand. 

- Accessible language is key to the long-term success and adoption of Playbooks. By building upon a foundation of strong primitives, we can develop rich vocabulary that can be applied in different contexts. Language is only as accessible as the extent to which it is resonant to its audience. Although the RPP narrative stays consistent, that language used to tell it should adapt to the audience to whom the story is being told. 

## Theme 3: Experimentation 

If we conceptualize RPP as a laboratory, then Playbooks are a set of experiments we’re running in the lab. Like any good experiment, we need to be methodical and deliberate in how we’re running the experiments.

There are a number of insights from interviews that will contribute to Playbook experimentation. We need an experimentation framework. This framework does not need to be over-the-top nor is it static. It does, however, need to be hypothesis-driven and repeatable such that we can systematically integrate Playbook feedback, both in terms of content and process, such that we can have confidence that Playbooks are delivering the kinds of pragmatic outcomes RPP desires. 

A well-defined set of quantitative and qualitative criteria for Playbook success will guide experiments. As the saying goes, what gets measured gets managed. A common and clearly-defined set of success criteria for Playbooks is a tool we can use to compare Playbook success in different contexts. 

Limit the experimentation space then expand over time. By constraining the space in which we run our initial experiments, we will have a richer understanding of the variables that affect the outcomes that we hope to empower with Playbooks. This may take the shape of starting with one or two super specific Playbooks with highly engaged stakeholders. This will let us test variables with high-fidelity feedback such that we can continue to improve Playbooks over time as we reach wider audiences.

## Theme 4: Playbooks as products 

Interviewees recognized that everyone will be coming to Playbooks with different degrees of experience and knowledge. Playbook efficacy is limited by the extent to which audiences have sufficient context to run the “plays” described in Playbooks.

Round 1 interviews led to an insight that Playbooks are like products. Digging into this is Round 2, recognizing the varying degrees of complexity required for a successful Playbook, the different contexts in which they’ll be used, and the different audiences they will target, we delineated different “product lines” in the overall “product suite”.

### **Guidebooks**

Non-technical, more general forms of content intended to help the end user build context on various domains. Guidebook elements include: intended for broad audiences, don’t assume technical or domain expertise, give reader sufficient context to use Playbooks, etc. Guidebook examples include: Web3 Wallets Overview, How Web3 Tech Improves Participatory Grantmaking, A Guide to Making a Case for Web3 Adoption in Nonprofits 

### **Playbooks**

Context-specific, actionable forms of content geared toward specific audiences and intended to promote specific outcomes. Playbooks are composed of “plays” that users can run in order to achieve pre-defined objectives. Playbook elements include: audience-specific, outcome-oriented, composable with other Playbooks, measurable success criteria, checklist-rich, etc. Playbook examples include: How to Set Up a Multi-Sig for a Community-Controlled Treasury, How to Migrate Your Participatory Grantmaking Program Onchain, How to Pitch Your Nonprofit Directors on Onchain Governance 

### **Case Studies**

Highlight the use and successes of Guidebooks and Playbooks. Case studies serve two purposes: 1) celebrate RPP wins, 2) attract similar audiences. Case studies elements include: specific user personas and organizations, illustrate measurable outcomes, highlight specific “plays” used, etc. Case study examples include: How All In For Sport Uses Web3 for IRL Resource Management, How SuperBenefit Dogfoods Playbooks for Governance

## Section 4: Visioning & Planning Prep 

The final stage of Phase 1 is Visioning & Planning. This stage is about taking everything we’ve learned during the Discovery stage and synthesizing it into a detailed project plan that the RPP team can execute on. It will kick off with a synchronous Visioning & Planning session to drive alignment amongst the core team. 

Following the sessions, moreReese will synthesize everything and provide the following deliverables:

- Project Charter (1) 

- Project Stakeholder Registry (1) 

- Project Risk Registry (1) 

- Detailed Project Plan (1) 

### Visioning & Planning Pre-Work 

In order to get the most out of the Visioning & Planning session, RPP team members should complete the following tasks: Read & comment on the Discovery Report Provide moreReese with the following: Minimum number of hours per week you can commit to RPP and Playbooks over the next 3 months No fewer than 5 sentences detailing the state of RPP and Playbook publication in 3 months The top 3 risk factors you see to achieving this state.

moreReese will then take this information to prepare an agenda and FigJam board for the Visioning & Planning session.

# Conclusion 

The Discovery interviews conducted with key members of the SuperBenefit Reimagining Power Project (RPP) team provided valuable insights into the project's current state, goals, and potential challenges. The interviews revealed a shared vision of leveraging Web3 technologies and DAO principles to transform governance models and power structures in nonprofit and philanthropic organizations. The RPP team recognizes the importance of creating practical, accessible, and actionable Playbooks that enable organizations to adopt these new approaches effectively.

The interviews also highlighted several focus areas for the project, including developing a strong narrative, improving cross-workstream collaboration, defining success metrics, creating user personas, and conducting targeted experiments. By addressing these areas, the RPP team can work towards achieving the project's ideal state of a self-sustaining ecosystem that empowers "Responsible Web3 Citizens" to drive systemic change.

Key themes that emerged from the interviews include activating the energy and enthusiasm surrounding the project, effectively communicating the RPP story, conducting methodical experiments, and treating Playbooks as products with distinct target audiences and outcomes. By leveraging these insights, the RPP team can develop a comprehensive project plan that ensures the successful creation and operationalization of Playbooks, ultimately contributing to the broader goals of the Reimagining Power Project.
