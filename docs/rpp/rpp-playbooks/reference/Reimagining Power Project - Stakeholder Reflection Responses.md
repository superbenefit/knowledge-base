# Reimagining Power Project: Stakeholder Reflection Responses

This document captures stakeholder feedback collected in July 2025 from participants in the Reimagining Power Project's stakeholder governance experiments.

---

## Response 1: Shannon Lanigan (All In For Sport)

**Date:** July 21, 2025  
**Organization:** All In For Sport  
**Email:** Lanigan.shannon@gmail.com

### Most significant shift in power/influence compared to traditional advisory roles

The ability to propose a project within the group and have full autonomy to do so, with support from other stakeholders.

### New conversations about governance and power-sharing

How we can continue exploring governance from a grassroots community perspective. How the capital flows can be assisted through web3 tech.

### Elements to take forward

This model is one we are currently using and continue to use within All In For Sport.

### Moment exemplifying difference from typical foundation-community relationships

I don't have an answer for this.

### Changed expectations for future philanthropic partnerships

It shows the possibility for a new future forward for community governance. I look forward to continuing this work in the sporting space.

### Requirements for distributed governance to become standard practice

A lot of education and onboarding. Also true proof of concepts and case studies.

### Stakeholder Governance 2.0 improvements

Clear explanations of the problem, the reason groups are coming together and what the outcome should look like.

### Story of the model working as intended

I can't think of an example in this project.

### Stakeholder vs. advisor distinction

As a stakeholder it felt like we were doing the exploration work together rather than giving individual expertise. It lead to great learnings from others.

### Unexpected capacities/skills developed

None that I can think of.

### Confidential reflections

None

### Additional comments

None

## Response 2: Nicole Matuska (Women Win)

**Date:** July 22, 2025  
**Organization:** Women Win  
**Email:** n.matuska@womenwin.org

### Most significant shift in power/influence compared to traditional advisory roles

The transparency and collaborative nature of input, and how it gets used, what is moved forward etc. was really refreshing. Often, in advisory roles, input is given but then you have no idea what happens afterwards, until something gets implemented. This process felt very accessible, that you could plug in and be part of what you were interested in and where you really brought value.

### New conversations about governance and power-sharing

I haven't yet but I think I really liked the cell approach to working, with layers such as community, stakeholder and core team cells that overlap and have clear structures for how they work with one another. It didn't feel hierarchical but rather, level of input and engagement required, or type of context needed.

### Elements to take forward

I think the cell working group approach was really interesting.

### Moment exemplifying difference from typical foundation-community relationships

*(No response provided)*

### Changed expectations for future philanthropic partnerships

The authentic collective decision making was at times slow moving but also ensured that how the project moved forward was led by the collective, not by an individual stakeholder. I think it might be hard to adopt in certain contexts and the right approach in others.

### Requirements for distributed governance to become standard practice

I think you would need a huge mindset shift and training, as it isn't easy to facilitate these types of structures.

### Stakeholder Governance 2.0 improvements

I can't think of anything I would change.

### Story of the model working as intended

I think it really worked when I showed interest, on behalf of Women Win, to join the EF experiment and support. It wasn't a long drawn out top down process to approve and bring us in, but a really open welcoming space to contribute where you think you add value and can support.

### Stakeholder vs. advisor distinction

You get as much as you give, so the more you engage, and the more value you can offer, the more influence maybe you have on the outcome as you are invested and doing the work. I think often, being an advisor limits you based on the remit and how much appetite there is from the group to engage you, versus the other way around.

### Unexpected capacities/skills developed

To just jump in and when I see I could offer something, or have questions, ask! Don't wait to be invited or for permission to ask or engage.

### Confidential reflections

## Key Themes from Feedback

### Power & Autonomy
- Stakeholders experienced genuine autonomy to propose and lead initiatives
- Transparency in decision-making and implementation was refreshing
- Collective decision-making, while slower, ensured true shared governance

### Structural Innovation
- Cell-based working approach (community, stakeholder, core team cells) was effective
- Non-hierarchical structure based on engagement level rather than power dynamics
- Open, welcoming space for contribution without lengthy approval processes

### Challenges & Requirements
- Need for extensive education and onboarding
- Requires mindset shift and training to facilitate effectively
- Clear problem definition and outcome expectations needed
- Proof of concepts and case studies essential for broader adoption

### Stakeholder vs. Advisor Distinction
- Stakeholders engage in collaborative exploration vs. giving individual expertise
- "You get as much as you give" - influence comes from engagement and contribution
- Permission-less participation encouraged vs. limited advisory remits

### Areas for Improvement
- Need clearer explanations of problems and expected outcomes
- Some participants couldn't identify specific moments where the model differentiated itself
- Balance between collective decision-making speed and authenticity
