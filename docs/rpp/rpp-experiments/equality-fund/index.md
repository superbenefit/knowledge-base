## Overview
The Equality Fund is exploring innovative governance models for feminist funding that embody their values of distributed power and collective decision-making.

## Key Challenges
- Traditional governance structures don't align with feminist values
- Need for transparent, participatory decision-making
- Balancing efficiency with inclusivity
- Ensuring diverse voices are heard and valued

## SuperBenefit Patterns Applied
- [Participatory Governance](data/concepts/participatory-governance.md) for inclusive decision-making
- DisCo pattern for distributed cooperative structures
- [Local Nodes](data/concepts/local-nodes.md) for regional representation
- [Impact Attestations](data/concepts/impact-attestations.md) for tracking social outcomes

## Outcomes & Learnings
- Successfully designed a multi-stakeholder governance model
- Created frameworks for power distribution
- Developed tools for transparent decision tracking
- Built capacity for ongoing governance evolution

## Next Steps
- Pilot governance model with initial funding rounds
- Develop digital tools for participation
- Create learning resources for other feminist organizations
- Share governance patterns with wider ecosystem
