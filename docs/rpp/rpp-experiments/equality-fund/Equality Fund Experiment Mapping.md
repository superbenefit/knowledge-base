## Notes from call re: Women Win 3/4/25

### Summary

- Women Win acts as a fiscal sponsor, managing and deploying funds for organizations that lack legal structure.

- Women Win provides comprehensive fiscal stewardship for projects like Numun Fund, including staff employment, grant disbursements, and operational costs.

- Women Win helps incubate groups to build their own structure while some groups prefer to maintain the fiscal host relationship indefinitely.

- Discussion of major barriers in cross-border transactions, including transaction costs, currency fluctuations, and regulatory restrictions.

- Internal processes at Women Win involve complex pathways for different types of payments and transactions, with funds commingled in one account.

- Concerns raised about KYC processes and data privacy requirements, especially for US-based transactions.

- Discussion about the feasibility of small-scale blockchain experiments versus large UN-style implementations.

- Exploration of stablecoins as a potential solution for managing currency fluctuations in cross-border transactions.

MinutesOverview of Women Win's Fiscal Sponsorship RoleWomen Win acts as a fiscal sponsor for various groups, receiving funds from organizations like the Equality Fund and passing them along to projects that cannot directly receive the money.Accepting funds from donors into Women Win's bank accounts is typically a straightforward transaction.Managing internal processes to allocate and disburse funds to various projects is part of their role.Handling a wide range of expenses for fiscally sponsored projects includes staff salaries, grant disbursements, travel expenses, and operational costs.Taking on legal and fiduciary responsibility for the projects they sponsor is necessary since these projects often lack their own legal structure.Incubating some groups helps them build their own operational and financial processes with the goal of eventually becoming independent entities.Managing multiple funding sources for some projects involves pooling resources from various donors and dispersing them based on the project's budget and needs.Specific Examples of Fiscally Sponsored ProjectsWomen Win sponsors several projects for the Equality Fund, including The Newman Fund which invests in and supports feminist tech solutions worldwide.The responsibilities under The Newman Fund include employing the fund director and staff, managing an advisory group, and handling all financial transactions including grantmaking to feminist tech groups and individuals globally.The Dahn Fund is another project, a feminist collective in the Caucasus region focusing on movement building and organizing work.Women Win employs the staff of The Dahn Fund and manages grant disbursements to local feminist groups in the area.Challenges in Cross-Border TransactionsBanking restrictions in certain countries limit the number of foreign transactions allowed per month or quarter.Increasing regulatory frameworks complicate international money transfers.Regional funds, particularly those in Africa, face difficulties moving money across countries due to banking system constraints.Potential account freezes or seizures in some locations require quick movement of funds.Currency fluctuations affect the value of funds held over time.Blockages at intermediary banks cause payments to be returned and necessitate alternative routing solutions.Financial Management and Operational ComplexitiesCommingling of funds in one account requires detailed bookkeeping to track different projects and allocations.A relatively small finance team (about 6-7 people) manages a high volume of transactions, handling around $30 million annually.Balancing autonomy for fiscally sponsored projects while maintaining necessary legal and fiduciary control is essential.Emergency funding requests need quick processing and disbursement.Navigating complex internal processes for different types of payments such as invoices, honorariums, and travel expenses is challenging.Privacy and Security ConcernsConcerns about the security of digital tools like DocuSign for contract signing exist.Protecting the identities of individuals receiving funds, especially in politically sensitive contexts, is crucial.Know Your Customer (KYC) processes present challenges, particularly when moving operations to the US, as some grantees are reluctant to provide detailed personal information.Worries about government access to personal data and identities of fund recipients persist.Potential for Blockchain and Cryptocurrency SolutionsUsing stablecoins could mitigate currency fluctuation risks while still leveraging the benefits of cryptocurrency transactions.Privacy-preserving protocols and zero-knowledge proofs could enhance security and protect sensitive information.Smaller-scale experiments with blockchain technology could focus on specific use cases or smaller groups rather than large-scale implementations.Platforms like Stellar for cross-border payments offer compatibility with common tools and focus on mobile accessibility.User-friendly interfaces and clear processes are needed to ensure comfort and prevent mistakes when adopting new technologies.Next Steps for ExplorationConducting a detailed mapping of Women Win's financial flows, including specific pain points, high-fee areas, and regulatory challenges, is suggested.Identifying potential partner organizations or individuals well-suited for a small-scale experiment with decentralized technology is recommended.Researching local cryptocurrency infrastructure and adoption in regions where Women Win operates will help understand the feasibility of using blockchain solutions in different contexts.Considering the balance between operational efficiency gains and the learning curve required for new technology adoption is important.Exploring grant opportunities from blockchain platforms like Stellar could potentially develop custom solutions for nonprofit use cases.

### Notes

Money comes into WW from EF via banks - very simple

Money going out is complicated

WW does a lot of fiscal sponsorship:

- Some recipients don't have legal structures

- WW employs a fund director and advisory group to run fund to disperse to recipients (feminist tech groups, etc)

- Project guides WW as to how to disperse funds (some advisors are employed by WW working in the project)

- WW pays for backend ops, bills, issues credit cards to recipients, hires consultants, otherwise spends operational funds

- WW employs their staff, pays their on-grants, etc

- WW builds out these orgs and their processes so they can spin out as their own entity

- Some groups don't want to spin out, so WW will perform those business services

- Many groups have multiple funders - WW may pool funds from funders to disperse

- WW also does pass-through funding for groups with legal structures in place or who need a 501c3 steward

- Transactions often go to individuals doing politically risky things

- Many international funding barriers exist

  - pain points

  - regional funds struggle to go through the banking systems; locked into tradfi

  - accounts being frozen in some places; funds seized

  - transaction costs are material but not extreme

  - Currency volatility can be challenging, especially when holding it for awhile

    - Sitting on millions waiting for it to be spent sometimes - holding volatile currency for a long time

  - Payments to individuals can be tricky using intermediary banks - one bank in the chain may refuse a txn

  - bank policies and regulations change, banks unwilling to work with WW/recipients

- Labor in payflows and accounting is a sink

  - Internal processed and checks are cumbersome

WW also does their own work.

- has a lot of advisors and other workers; pays small stipends for the work to many workers - payments bounce, lots of work, etc

- bank fees are high - WW has to cover fees

Appetite for adoption:

- CFO interested in experimenting - leadership buy-in

- Less restrictions than equality fund

- Willing to experiment with real funds if they have the right partner

- Workers seem willing to try new tools to better serve movements and projects

- Need to map partners who might be willing to experiment

  - Unsure whether EF on-grants are willing to experiment with onchain tools

- small finance team \~7 people

- Unsure how much autonomy can be given to stewarded partners

- small emergency payments are common

- Some groups have concerns around KYC processes to get funds from the US
