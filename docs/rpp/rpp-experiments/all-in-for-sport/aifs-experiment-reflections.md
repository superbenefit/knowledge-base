# All In For Sport Experiment Reflections

This reflection captures learning from the All In For Sport experiment within the Reimagining Power project, covering the gathering series and governance transformation activities that took place from late 2023 through mid-2024.

---

## Setting the Context

### Period and Activities Covered

This reflection encompasses two interconnected streams of work within the All In For Sport experiment:

**The Gathering Series**: An iterative process of five community gatherings plus an initial stakeholder kickoff, designed to bring together diverse perspectives from grassroots sports organizations and Web3 technology innovators. Each gathering built upon insights from previous sessions, allowing for real-time adaptation and refinement of our approach to bridge these traditionally separate communities.

**Governance Transformation**: A parallel effort to shift All In For Sport's organizational structure from a product-led approach to a coordination-focused model. This involved identifying clear distinctions between the operational DAO functions and individual project cells, defining roles and responsibilities within the new governance framework, and establishing mechanisms for resource sharing that would create a sustainable flywheel for ongoing coordination work.

### Core Objectives

Our primary mission centered on understanding the genuine needs at the intersection of grassroots sports, community development, and emerging Web3 technologies. We sought to create spaces for meaningful information exchange between practitioners who rarely interact - those working directly in community sports programs and those developing blockchain-based solutions that could potentially serve these communities.

Through this process, we aimed to clarify All In For Sport's value proposition as a DAO. Rather than trying to be a direct service provider, we discovered our strength lay in reducing silos between industries and facilitating knowledge sharing as the foundation for collaborative projects. This coordination role emerged as our unique contribution to the ecosystem - connecting disparate groups who share common goals but lack pathways for collaboration.

### Participants and Stakeholders

The experiment engaged a diverse range of participants including grassroots sports organizations, Web3 developers and entrepreneurs, funding partners like Women Win and Equality Fund, community organizers from various cultural contexts, and the All In For Sport core team managing weekly planning sessions and daily operations.

### Reflection Timing

This retrospective comes at the conclusion of the formal experiment period, providing an opportunity to synthesize learnings while experiences remain fresh and to inform future iterations of our coordination model.

## What Actually Happened

### Gathering Activities

The gathering series unfolded through multiple layers of activity. Our core team met weekly to plan and refine each session based on emerging insights. These planning meetings proved essential for maintaining coherence across the iterative process while allowing flexibility to respond to participant needs.

Beyond the gatherings themselves, we maintained consistent community engagement through Discord channels, ensuring conversations could continue between formal sessions. Our social media manager worked diligently to communicate the purpose and progress of the gatherings to broader audiences, helping attract diverse participants and share emerging insights.

The operational infrastructure included recording all sessions for future reference, managing contributor payments to ensure fair compensation for participation, and creating "poetic harvests" - creative syntheses of key themes that made complex discussions more accessible. Initial sensemaking calls with partners helped establish shared understanding before the main gathering series began, while a comprehensive retrospective at the series' end captured collective insights.

### Governance Evolution

The governance transformation proceeded smoothly, feeling like a natural evolution rather than a forced change. Through team discussions, we integrated learnings from the gatherings directly into our organizational structure. This involved formalizing operational governance frameworks that distinguished between community-driven initiatives and core operational functions.

We engineered specific DAO policies designed to support coordination as our primary function, including mechanisms for resource sharing between cells and operational functions. The ratification of this new operational governance happened without significant contention - a sign that the changes addressed real needs recognized by all participants.

### Participation Patterns

While we anticipated consistent attendance across all gatherings, participation patterns revealed important insights about engagement. Attendees tended to join sessions most relevant to their specific interests rather than attending the entire series. This selective participation, initially disappointing, ultimately led to more focused and productive conversations within each session.

### Concrete Outputs

The experiment produced several tangible outcomes including documented governance frameworks for coordination-focused DAOs, recorded sessions providing ongoing learning resources, strengthened relationships between previously disconnected organizations, validated models for bridging Web3 technology and grassroots sports, and clear articulation of All In For Sport's role as a coordination facilitator rather than direct service provider.

### Timeline Reality

The experiment timeline largely followed initial plans, though the iterative nature of the gatherings meant some sessions evolved significantly from original concepts based on participant feedback and emerging insights.

## Surprises and Discoveries

### Unexpected Enthusiasm from Web3 Community

Perhaps the most pleasant surprise was the incredible response and interest from the Web3 community. The eagerness of blockchain developers and entrepreneurs to engage with grassroots sports challenges exceeded all expectations. Rather than the skepticism or disinterest we might have anticipated, we found genuine enthusiasm for applying emerging technologies to real community needs.

This enthusiasm revealed a broader pattern - many Web3 projects already working in adjacent spaces could easily apply their solutions to sports and community development contexts. The technology ecosystem proved more mature and applicable than initially assumed.

### Emerging Collaborative Relationships

The collaboration with Women Win and their connection to Equality Fund emerged organically through the experiment. This relationship demonstrated how our coordination work could catalyze Web3 adoption journeys for established organizations. The ability to form mutually beneficial partnerships, where we could provide technical guidance while learning from their deep community experience, validated our coordination model.

The discovery of aligned communities like the Waatajoo (referring to Indigenous communities exploring blockchain for economic development) revealed universal themes. Women in these communities seeking revenue generation methods for their tribes faced remarkably similar challenges to those in our sports organizations, despite vastly different cultural contexts.

### Cultural Universality of Sport's Impact

Building on insights from previous work on "two-eyed seeing" approaches, we confirmed that while the cultural purpose of sport varies significantly across communities, its impact remains universal. This understanding helps bridge diverse groups who might otherwise see little common ground.

### Participation Patterns and Inclusivity Challenges

Lower attendance than expected initially felt disappointing but ultimately revealed important truths about engagement. People's time is limited, and they engage most deeply with content directly relevant to their work. This led to smaller but more meaningful conversations with highly engaged participants.

A critical learning emerged around technical accessibility. We consistently needed to keep technology discussions at a basic level to include grassroots participants, which sometimes frustrated Web3 participants eager for deeper technical exploration. This tension revealed an important insight: in trying to be maximally inclusive, we sometimes became accidentally exclusive to those seeking more specialized discussions.

### Validation and New Opportunities

The experiment validated our core hypothesis about the need for coordination between grassroots sports and Web3 technology. This validation came not just through participant feedback but through concrete opportunities - the gatherings helped demonstrate our value to the International Olympic Committee and contributed to our acceptance into the TED 365 collective, opening doors for future work.

However, this success also highlighted ongoing challenges. Maintaining momentum and engagement after initial enthusiasm requires dedicated community coordination - work that remains chronically under-resourced in both traditional nonprofits and DAOs.

## Stakeholder Experiences

### Diverse Perspectives on Value

Different stakeholder groups experienced the experiment through their unique lenses. Web3 participants appreciated the opportunity to understand real-world applications for their technologies. Grassroots organizations valued exposure to potential new funding and operational models. Funding partners like Women Win found guidance for their own Web3 exploration journeys.

The capital flow experiments conducted by other RPP stakeholders (particularly the Equality Fund and Women Win work) proved especially interesting to participants, as these addressed universal challenges around transparent, efficient resource distribution.

### Confusion Around Roles and Resources

(Exhibit A: The following section incorporates direct feedback from Shannon's stakeholder experience)

A significant source of confusion emerged around project funding and stakeholder roles. Many stakeholders, including All In For Sport leadership, entered the project with the understanding that RPP's $100,000 grant would include direct funding for stakeholder experiments. This expectation, while reasonable given initial communications, didn't align with the actual structure where RPP funding primarily supported SuperBenefit's coordination and knowledge capture work.

This misalignment created several challenges. Stakeholders found themselves attending meetings without clear understanding of their role or expected contributions. The question "What is All In For Sport's role in this project?" persisted throughout much of the experiment. When it became clear that gathering activities aligned with RPP deliverables wouldn't receive direct funding, All In For Sport had to secure separate funding through Jumpstart to compensate gathering participants.

The lack of upfront clarity about "who does what" and "who resources what" represents a missed opportunity for more effective collaboration. Future experiments would benefit from explicit discussion of roles, responsibilities, and resource allocation in initial stakeholder meetings.

### Process Preferences and Meeting Culture

Stakeholder feedback also revealed important differences in working styles and preferences. Some participants, particularly those managing multiple initiatives, expressed frustration with extended team-building activities and preferred more direct, task-focused meetings. The comment "I like to know what is expected of me, then move on to the other gazillion things on my schedule" captures a common sentiment among busy practitioners.

This feedback suggests the need for balance - creating enough relational foundation for effective collaboration while respecting participants' time constraints and varied working styles. The insight that "levity and relationship-building can happen through the process of exploration rather than forced activities" offers a path forward.

## Progress Against Intentions

### Validated Hypotheses

The experiment successfully validated several core hypotheses. The need for coordination between grassroots sports and Web3 technology proved even greater than anticipated. All In For Sport's potential role as a coordination facilitator rather than direct service provider emerged clearly. The universal challenges faced by marginalized communities in sports contexts, regardless of geographic or cultural differences, confirmed the broad applicability of our approach.

### Emergent Value Proposition

Through the experiment, All In For Sport's value proposition crystallized: we serve as a coordination layer that reduces silos between industries and enables knowledge sharing as the foundation for collaborative projects. This clarity about our role represents significant progress from earlier, more diffuse conceptualizations of our purpose.

### Sustainable Model Challenges

While we made progress on governance structures and coordination models, creating financially sustainable approaches for this coordination work remains an ongoing challenge. The chronic under-resourcing of community coordination roles - a problem shared by traditional nonprofits and DAOs alike - continues to limit potential impact.

---

## Challenges and Responses

### Balancing Technical Depth with Accessibility

The need to keep technology discussions accessible to non-technical participants while maintaining engagement from Web3 experts proved consistently challenging. Initial attempts to serve both audiences in the same sessions led to frustration on both sides.

Our response evolved through the gathering series. We began considering separated tracks - "sport and community" versus "sport and tech" - that could maintain connection while allowing appropriate depth for each audience. This approach acknowledges that being "so inclusive that you become exclusive" serves no one well.

### Stakeholder Alignment and Communication

The confusion around funding, roles, and responsibilities revealed systematic communication challenges. Initial stakeholder meetings focused too heavily on team-building exercises rather than establishing clear operational agreements.

Moving forward, we've identified the need for explicit upfront discussions covering: each stakeholder's contributions and capabilities, resource allocation and funding flows, decision-making processes and authorities, and success metrics and individual responsibilities. Creating structured stakeholder onboarding that addresses these elements could prevent similar confusion in future experiments.

### Momentum Maintenance

Post-gathering engagement proved difficult to sustain without dedicated resources for community management. While initial enthusiasm ran high, converting that energy into ongoing participation required more infrastructure than available.

This challenge reflects broader issues in the DAO space around sustainable community engagement models. Potential responses include developing lighter-weight engagement models requiring less intensive coordination, securing dedicated funding for community management roles, and creating clearer pathways from initial interest to meaningful participation.

## Patterns and Insights

### Coordination as Core Value

The experiment reinforced that All In For Sport's primary value lies not in direct service delivery but in creating connections between previously isolated actors. This coordination function addresses a genuine ecosystem need that few organizations are positioned to fill.

### Universal Challenges, Contextual Solutions

While specific implementations must respect local contexts, the underlying challenges faced by marginalized communities in sports prove remarkably consistent globally. This pattern suggests potential for shared learning and solution development across diverse contexts.

### The Inclusion Paradox

Attempting to make every activity maximally inclusive can paradoxically exclude those seeking specialized engagement. Effective coordination requires creating multiple pathways for participation rather than forcing all stakeholders through identical processes.

### Resource Allocation Reflects Values

How projects allocate resources - particularly between coordination/facilitation work and direct program delivery - fundamentally shapes what becomes possible. The chronic under-resourcing of coordination functions limits ecosystem development potential.

### Iterative Adaptation Essential

The gathering series' success stemmed largely from its iterative design, allowing real-time adaptation based on participant feedback. This flexibility, while requiring more intensive management, produced more relevant and impactful outcomes than rigid predetermined structures would have allowed.

## Next Steps and Adaptations

### Immediate Actions

Based on these reflections, several immediate adaptations will strengthen future work:

1. **Implement structured stakeholder onboarding** that explicitly addresses roles, responsibilities, resource allocation, and success metrics from the outset of any collaboration.

2. **Develop differentiated engagement pathways** that allow participants to engage at technically appropriate levels while maintaining ecosystem coherence.

3. **Create sustainable funding models** for coordination work, potentially through hybrid approaches combining grant funding, fee-for-service elements, and ecosystem contributions.

### Questions for Further Exploration

- How might we create "lighter-weight" coordination models that require less intensive resource investment while maintaining impact?
- What mechanisms could incentivize ecosystem participants to contribute to shared coordination infrastructure?
- How do we balance the need for stable coordination functions with the dynamic, experimental nature of DAO work?

### Stakeholder Implications

Future experiments should involve funding partners earlier in design processes to ensure alignment between funding structures and stakeholder needs. Technical partners need clearer pathways for deep engagement without sacrificing accessibility for others. Grassroots organizations require ongoing support to bridge into Web3 contexts meaningfully rather than superficially.

### Building on Success

The validation received through IOC engagement and TED 365 collective acceptance creates platforms for expanded work. Leveraging these opportunities requires maintaining experimental spirit while professionalizing coordination infrastructure.

The knowledge capture systems developed through RPP provide foundations for ongoing learning. Investing in making this knowledge more accessible and actionable for diverse stakeholders could multiply impact beyond direct experiment participants.

## Reflection Synthesis

This experiment demonstrated both the vital need for coordination between grassroots sports and Web3 technology and the challenges inherent in creating sustainable models for such coordination. While we successfully validated our core hypothesis and clarified All In For Sport's value proposition, questions remain about financial sustainability and optimal engagement models.

The tension between inclusivity and specialization emerged as a central challenge requiring ongoing navigation. Similarly, aligning stakeholder expectations with project realities proved more complex than anticipated but yielded valuable insights for future collaboration design.

Moving forward, All In For Sport is well-positioned to serve as a coordination layer in the sports and Web3 ecosystem. Success will require continued experimentation with engagement models, more sustainable funding approaches for coordination work, and careful attention to stakeholder alignment from the outset of any initiative.

The patterns revealed through this experiment - around universal challenges requiring contextual solutions, the value of iterative adaptation, and the critical importance of coordination functions - provide guidance not just for All In For Sport but for the broader ecosystem seeking to bridge technological innovation with community needs.
