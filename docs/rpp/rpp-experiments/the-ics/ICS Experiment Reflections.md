## What Actually Happened

### Activity documentation

**Governance Infrastructure:**

- ✅ ICS multisig wallet set up (0x3B454B53B4c414fFa8297EC49C9d5F040Cf035f8)

- ✅ ENS domain established (theics.eth)

- ✅ Hats Protocol roles implementation (Tree 100/119)

- ✅ Snapshot space configuration (completed)

- ✅ CharmVerse space launch (https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/ics-workspace-6136932233367063)

- ✅ SuperBenefit on-chain accounting integration (completed but not documented)

- ✅ Cell State document creation (in ics-governance repo)

- **Active users**: 4 people actively using these systems (exceeding goal of 3+)

**Hypercert for Repair Café:**

- ✅ Data collected: items repaired, waste diverted from landfill, participation in Repair Café events, volunteer hours

- ❌ Traditional hypercert not minted

- ✅ **Alternative approach**: Participated in Gitcoin Grants Round 23 (GG23)

- ✅ Created Karma GAP profile for on-chain impact recording: https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/regen-coordination-x-institute-for-community-sustainability-ics/impact

- **Major success**: Achieved top 10% ranking in GG23 funding

**Green Pill Network Chapter:**

- ✅ Chapter application submitted (January 2025)

- ✅ Application approved (February 2025)

- ✅ Separate ENS & multisig wallet created for chapter (details in ics-governance repo)

- ✅ Governance structure established using Hats Protocol

- ✅ Four meetings held (March 23, March 30, April 10, June 9, 2025)

- **Attendance**: 4 people at each meeting

**Web3 Onboarding:**

- 🔄 Workshop in development (not yet delivered)

- ✅ Research phase completed: gathered information from various partners, sources, and courses

- **Community feedback**: Locals want to learn how to "do"/participate in web3, not just learn theory

- **Goal**: Showcase through simultaneous learning and doing how web3 tools enable local social impact

### Participation data

\[WAITING ON INFO - Numbers, demographics, engagement levels for each activity. This section needs:

- How many unique people participated across all activities?

- Demographics if known (age ranges, backgrounds, web3 experience levels)

- Engagement patterns (one-time vs ongoing participation)

- Geographic distribution (local vs remote participants)\]

### Concrete outputs

- ICS multisig wallet (0x3B454B53B4c414fFa8297EC49C9d5F040Cf035f8) and ENS domain (theics.eth) operational

- Cell State governance document published in public repository

- Karma GAP profile with on-chain impact attestations

- Successful GG23 campaign achieving top 10% ranking

- Web3 onboarding curriculum in development (intro workshop + 8-week cohort)

### Timeline reality

- Implementation plan targeted March-May 2025 completion

- Actual timeline extended to July 2025 (reporting point)

- **Key insight**: The timeline had to respond to circumstances and team capacity rather than forcing a predetermined sequence and timing of events

- This flexible approach led to better outcomes (e.g., GG23 success, stronger network connections)

### Resource usage

- **OTF Budget**: \[TO BE COMPLETED - Not very much of the budget was spent, need exact figures\]

- **Volunteer contributions**: Dozens if not hundreds of hours contributed by core team and volunteers

- \[NOTE: More detailed budget breakdown to be added later\]

## Surprises and Discoveries

### Positive surprises

- **GG23 success**: Achieved top 10% ranking in Gitcoin Grants Round 23, which was far beyond expectations for our first time participating

- **GreenPill meetings exceeded plan**: Hosted 4+ meetings instead of the single planned inaugural meeting, showing sustained engagement

- **GreenPill Toronto event**: Unexpected opportunity to participate in the GreenPill Toronto event at Consensus conference in May 2025

- **Earthfest booth opportunity**: Secured a booth at Earthfest to introduce GreenPill to the broader London community

- **ETHDenver connections**: Heenal had the opportunity to attend ETHDenver and connect with GreenPill stewards and activists in person, strengthening network connections

### Challenges

- **Web3 newcomer mobilization**: It has been harder than expected to mobilize people who are new to Web3 - the learning curve and skepticism were higher barriers than anticipated

- **Onboarding workshop timing**: The planned workshop felt unnecessary for where the community was at - there weren't enough people ready to participate in a formal workshop

- **Timeline flexibility required**: The timeline had to respond to circumstances and team capacity rather than following the predetermined sequence and timing of events

### Emergent opportunities

- **Earthfest booth**: Unexpected opportunity to have a presence at this major local sustainability event

- **GG23 funding round**: The chance to participate in Gitcoin Grants Round 23 emerged as a major opportunity

- **GreenPill Toronto @ Consensus**: Invitation to participate in the GreenPill Toronto event at the Consensus conference

- **Community currency workshop**: Scott Morris workshop on community currencies (in-person workshop at ICS in May 2025 - organized at short notice due to Scott coming to Toronto and us having had recent conversations with him) opened possibilities for developing a commitment pooling system for London

- **AlloIRL tool discovery**: Found the brand new AlloIRL tool for conducting in-person quadratic funding experiments

### Invalidated assumptions

- **Expected more local engagement**: Thought there would be more immediate engagement from Londoners with web3 initiatives, but the interest was lower than anticipated

- **Hypercert approach**: Original assumption was to mint a traditional hypercert, but Karma GAP proved more appropriate as it's become almost the standard in the regen space

- **Workshop format**: Assumed a single workshop would work, but community feedback showed need for deeper, ongoing learning experiences

### New understanding

- **Karma GAP as standard**: Realized that Karma GAP has become the de facto standard for impact tracking in the regen space, making it more appropriate than traditional hypercerts for the kind of impact we're tracking

- **Learning by doing preference**: Community members want to actively participate in web3, not just learn about it theoretically - they need hands-on experience

- **Opportunistic timeline benefits**: Responding to opportunities as they arise (rather than forcing predetermined timelines) led to better outcomes like GG23 success and valuable conference connections

- **Dual approach needed**: Need both introductory content AND deeper cohort experiences to meet different community member needs

## Stakeholder Experiences

### Direct quotes

\[WAITING ON HEENAL FOR TESTIMONIALS/QUOTES\]

- **Governance tools**: No specific feedback - the 4 active users were already familiar with these types of tools

- **GG23 campaign**: No specific quotes recalled (Twitter account @heenalr may have some public responses)

- **Earthfest booth**: Conversations were mostly high-level introductions to concepts rather than detailed feedback

### Experience variations

- **Relationship to ICS**: Everyone involved already had some relationship to ICS, so there wasn't a stark insider/outsider dynamic

- **Local vs global**: Primary engagement was from local participants already connected to ICS network

### Satisfaction indicators

- Team members continued to show up and engage throughout the experiment

- Consistent attendance at GreenPill meetings (4 people at each meeting)

- Successful GG23 campaign suggests community support for the work

### Behaviour changes

- **Increased web3 awareness**: Participants are definitely becoming more aware of the potential of web3 on a local level

- **Tool usage**: Core team members now regularly use CharmVerse, multisig, and other governance tools

- Otherwise, not much dramatic behavior change - more of a gradual shift in understanding and capability

### Relationship shifts

- **Strengthened collaboration**: The experiment has fostered connection and co-creation among the 4 members actively involved

- **Joint initiatives emerging**: The closer collaboration is sparking joint initiatives and projects beyond the original scope

- **Shared language**: Team now has shared vocabulary and understanding around web3 governance concepts

## Progress Against Intentions

### Challenge progress

From the Discovery Report, key challenges included:

**1. Governance bottlenecks**

- **Progress**: Limited - The new infrastructure hasn't yet touched everyday decision-making. Still in experimental phase and some way from practical implementation

- **Decision efficiency**: No change yet - decisions are still being made through traditional processes

- **Outlook**: Infrastructure is in place but integration into daily operations is still 6-18 months away

**2. Contributor engagement**

- **Volunteer engagement with new systems**: No - ICS volunteers haven't been engaged with the new systems in any significant way yet

- **Ease of participation**: Not yet improved, but strong belief that the systems being created will make engagement much easier in the coming 6-18 months

- **Current state**: Only the core team of 4 is using the new governance tools

**3. Community ownership and resilience**

- **Ownership feelings**: Mixed - Within the core team of 4, everyone now feels some ownership of ICS. However, this hasn't extended to the broader volunteer base

- **Decentralized approach impact**: Not yet realized, but expected to develop over time

- **Current limitation**: Benefits of decentralization remain within the small experimental group

**4. Funding and financial sustainability**

- **GG23 impact**: Not materially significant financially, but the impressive success has encouraged the team and built confidence about future opportunities

- **New funding pathways**: Gradually discovering new pathways through web3, but need to focus on completing deliverables to build track record for future applications

- **Strategic insight**: Success breeds success - early wins are opening doors even if not immediately lucrative

### Success indicator status

Original success metrics:

1. ✅ Governance systems operational with 3+ active participants - **ACHIEVED**: 4 active users

2. ✅ At least one Hypercert minted and publicized - **MODIFIED SUCCESS**: Instead of traditional hypercert, achieved on-chain impact recording through Karma GAP profile and top 10% GG23 ranking

3. ✅ First Green Pill Network meetup hosted - **EXCEEDED**: 4 meetings held

4. 🔄 Onboarding workshop developed and piloted - **IN PROGRESS**: Workshop content developed, moving from single workshop to dual format (intro + 8-week cohort)

### Unexpected progress

- **Community pooling & community currency**: Emerging interest and development in commitment pooling systems and local currency initiatives (sparked by Scott Morris workshop)

- **Network effects**: Connections made through conferences and GG23 are creating unexpected collaboration opportunities

### Stalled areas

- **Communication to non-web3 audiences**: Surprisingly difficult to communicate the value of the work to "normies" - the gap between web3 and mainstream understanding is wider than anticipated

- **Progress delays from opportunities**: ETH Denver, GG23, and Consensus Toronto were valuable opportunities but significantly set back progress in other areas due to time and focus requirements

- **Broader volunteer engagement**: Expected to have more ICS volunteers involved by now, but engagement remains limited to core team

---

## Challenges and Responses

### Challenge descriptions

**Specific obstacles encountered:**

- **Explaining web3 to non-technical audiences**: Major challenge in finding effective ways to communicate web3 concepts to "normies" - the technical jargon and conceptual gap proved larger than expected

- **Time allocation**: Devoting adequate time to the experiment while managing other responsibilities and opportunities

- **Momentum maintenance**: Deciding against a formal GreenPill London launch event meant missing an opportunity to build momentum - the team lost some drive as a result

- **Team capacity**: All 4 core team members were undergoing various stresses/transitions during the implementation period

### Risk realization

Anticipated risks from implementation plan:

1. **ICS decision-making on governance structure** - ✅ NO CHALLENGES - Consensus was easily reached

2. **Coordination between ICS and RPP** - ✅ NO CHALLENGES - Teams were fully aligned throughout

3. **Technical challenges with hypercerts** - ⚠️ PIVOT NEEDED - Not technical issues but adoption considerations; Karma GAP was required for GG23 participation and is becoming the standard in granting rounds

4. **Community engagement sustainability** - 😅 SIDESTEPPED - "We sidestepped this issue by not really engaging with the community much at all LOL"

### Response strategies

**General approach**:

- Responded fluidly, working with emergence rather than forcing predetermined plans

- Embraced flexibility as opportunities arose

**What worked well**:

- **Flexibility**: Ability to pivot and respond to opportunities as they emerged (GG23, conferences, etc.)

- **Alignment**: Strong coordination between ICS and RPP meant no internal friction

- **Pragmatism**: Choosing Karma GAP over traditional hypercerts based on ecosystem standards

**What didn't work**:

- **Launch event cancellation**: Deciding against a formal GreenPill London launch event robbed the team of a chance to build momentum

- **Limited community engagement**: Focusing on core team meant missing broader community building opportunities

- **Communication strategy**: Still struggling to effectively communicate web3 value to mainstream audiences

### Effectiveness assessment

- **Successful pivots**: Moving to Karma GAP and focusing on GG23 proved highly effective

- **Infrastructure success**: Governance tools are in place and functional for core team

- **Limited reach**: Effectiveness limited by not engaging broader community

- **Mixed results**: Strong technical implementation but weak community adoption

### Adaptation lessons

**What to do differently**:

- **Start web3 workshops/cohorts much earlier**: Don't wait for perfect conditions - begin education early and iterate

- **Plan launch events**: Create momentum-building events even if team capacity is limited

- **Invest in communication**: Develop clear, accessible ways to explain web3 value from the start

**Advice for other communities**:

- **Communication is key**: "Plan out how to communicate - and demonstrate - the value of how you're using web3, in a way that just makes sense to people"

- **Start education early**: Don't underestimate the time needed to bring people along on the web3 journey

- **Be flexible**: Work with emergence rather than rigid plans

- **Expect capacity challenges**: Team members will have life transitions - plan for this reality

## Patterns and Insights

### Recurring patterns

**Common themes across activities:**

- **Persistent capacity constraints**: Across all activities, limited human capacity emerged as a constant challenge. Team members juggled multiple responsibilities, and the experiment often competed with other urgent priorities.

- **Communication barriers**: A consistent challenge was translating web3 concepts into language accessible to mainstream audiences. Technical jargon and abstract concepts created significant barriers to engagement.

- **Infrastructure vs adoption gap**: While technical infrastructure (like CharmVerse) worked well with the RPP's established templates and battle-tested procedures, social adoption lagged significantly behind technical readiness.

**Response patterns to web3:**

- **Resonance with values**: Concepts of ownership and sovereignty consistently sparked interest, suggesting alignment with desires for autonomy and self-determination

- **Institutional skepticism**: Strong antipathy toward bureaucracy, traditional banking, and centralized institutions created openness to alternatives

- **Technical confusion**: Mixed responses to technical elements like wallets and tokens - some found them intuitive while others were confused by the new paradigm

### System insights

**How change happens in London:**

- **Conservative innovation culture**: London tends to follow rather than lead trends, requiring proof of concept from elsewhere before local adoption

- **Slow transformation process**: Change requires sustained effort over time with consistent presence and repeated exposure to new ideas

- **Relationship-based adoption**: Innovation spreads through trusted networks and personal connections rather than through institutional channels

**Bridging the web3/normie gap requires:**

- **Direct personal value**: Abstract benefits aren't enough - people need to see immediate, tangible value to their daily lives

- **Enjoyable experiences**: Fun, social elements are essential for engagement - dry technical presentations fail to inspire participation

- **Concrete applications**: Moving from abstract concepts to specific, relatable use cases is critical for understanding

**Innovation spread patterns:**

- **Repetition builds familiarity**: Multiple exposures through different contexts help normalize new concepts

- **Social events as catalysts**: Fun, well-designed events create positive associations and memorable experiences

- **Demonstration over explanation**: Showing tangible examples works better than theoretical discussions

### Transferable principles

**What could work elsewhere:**

- **Patience as prerequisite**: Web3 adoption is universally challenging and requires long-term commitment rather than expecting quick wins

- **Fun as fundamental**: Making experiences enjoyable isn't optional - it's essential for overcoming the inherent complexity of web3

- **Team cohesion critical**: Strong relationships within the core team provide resilience through inevitable challenges and setbacks

- **Documentation as foundation**: Systematic documentation creates learning resources and demonstrates progress to stakeholders

**Universal truths about local web3 adoption:**

- **Inherent complexity**: The fundamental difficulty of explaining and implementing web3 at local levels is universal, not context-specific

- **Technical readiness precedes social readiness**: Infrastructure can be built quickly, but cultural adoption takes much longer

- **Small teams can prototype, but scaling requires different approaches**: What works for 4 engaged people won't automatically work for 40 or 400

- **The conceptual gap is wider than expected**: The distance between web3 thinking and mainstream understanding consistently surprises even experienced practitioners

- **Opportunities arise unexpectedly**: Success often comes from responding to emergent opportunities rather than executing predetermined plans

**Context-specific considerations:**

- London's conservative culture may slow adoption compared to more innovation-friendly cities

- Existing strong community bonds can be leveraged once trust is established

- Local preference for proven models suggests focusing on successful examples from elsewhere

### Evolved understanding

**Web3 and local sustainability relationship:**

- **Initial assumptions**: The team originally focused on impact attestations and bringing external web3 funding into the community

- **Evolved perspective**: Real interest lies in participation and agency - people want to be involved in decisions that affect them

- **What actually resonates**: Local quadratic funding experiments, transparent decision-making processes, commitment pooling, and community currencies capture imagination more than abstract attestations

- **Key insight**: The shift from "bringing resources in" to "enabling participation" represents a fundamental reorientation of the work

**Governance transformation insights:**

- **Time scales are longer than expected**: Governance transformation can't be rushed - it requires patient cultivation

- **Multiple scales enable experimentation**: Testing governance innovations at different levels and in various projects provides learning without risking everything

- **Small experiments inform larger transformations**: Pilot projects create proof points and build confidence for bigger changes

- **Technical implementation is the easy part**: The real challenge lies in cultural change and adoption

**Theory of change evolution:**

- **From resource focus to participation focus**: Moving beyond viewing web3 primarily as a funding mechanism

- **From technical solutions to social solutions**: Recognizing that community engagement matters more than perfect infrastructure

- **From external to internal**: Shifting from bringing outside resources to enabling local agency and decision-making

### Key learnings

**Most important insights:**

1. **Complexity of adoption**: The difficulty of explaining and implementing web3 for local communities is the central challenge - there are no easy shortcuts

2. **Joy as sustainability strategy**: Making the work enjoyable isn't a nice-to-have - it's essential for maintaining momentum through difficulties

3. **Transparency creates value**: Documenting and sharing everything builds trust, enables learning, and creates resources for others

4. **People over protocols**: Building strong team relationships and culture trumps perfect technical implementation every time

5. **Emergence over planning**: Being responsive to opportunities (like GG23) yields better results than rigid adherence to plans

**Biggest surprises:**

- **Speed of ecosystem integration**: Once engaged, opportunities like GG23 participation and conference invitations came faster than expected

- **Warmth of web3 community**: The openness and welcoming nature of the broader web3 ecosystem exceeded expectations

- **Value of in-person connections**: Conferences like ETH Denver and Consensus Toronto provided relationship-building that accelerated progress

- **Success breeding success**: Early wins like GG23 created momentum and opened doors to further opportunities

## Next Steps and Adaptations

### Planned adaptations

**Specific approach changes:**

- **Shift to cohort model**: Moving from single workshop to 8-week learning cohort that combines education with hands-on experience

- **Public demonstration focus**: Building toward a major public IRL quadratic funding demonstration in fall 2025 to showcase web3's practical value

- **Stealth integration**: Slowly introducing web3 tools through familiar entry points like event ticketing and local mediums of exchange

**Web3 onboarding adjustments:**

- Focus on "learning by doing" rather than theoretical education

- Use familiar tools as gateways (ticketing, local currency) before introducing more complex concepts

- Create multiple touchpoints over 8 weeks rather than one-time exposure

**GreenPill London evolution:**

- Shift focus to active "green-pilling" - being more evangelistic about web3's transformative potential

- Move from explaining technology to demonstrating concrete benefits

- Build momentum through regular, engaging events rather than sporadic meetings

**Governance implementation changes:**

- Ensure core team achieves deep familiarity and consistenxy with web3 tools before expanding usage

- Intentionally expand scope, always centring community benefit

- Thoughtfully address onboarding challenges before they become barriers

- Test each new tool with small groups before wider rollout

### New questions

**Questions raised by the experiment:**

- "What would it take to pilot an alternative economic system here in London, Ontario?"

- "How could web3 tools serve the needs of the most disadvantaged people in our city?"

- "How can we make web3 tools so easy and seamless that even my mom could use it?"

- How do we balance innovation with accessibility?

- What's the minimum viable community for sustainable web3 adoption?

**Areas to explore:**

- Commitment pooling systems for mutual aid

- Super-easy wallet solutions that remove technical barriers

- Local mini-UBI pilot using web3 infrastructure
