## **About ICS**

ICS (Institute for Community Sustainability) is a grassroots **community organization** **based in** **the Carolinian Canada bioregion and headquartered in the city now known as** **London, Ontario,** which lies on the traditional territory of the Anishinaabeg, Haudenosaunee, Lenape, Attawandaron and the Wendat peoples.

ICS began its work in 2018 and incorporated as a not-for-profit in 2021. Rooted in the belief that real impact starts at the grassroots level, we put our energy into practical, on-the-ground programs that strengthen local resilience, focussing on community-building and environmental initiatives. Our team brings decades of hands-on experience in the environmental, social impact,  and community development sectors, having cultivated partnerships with local, national, and international charities, community groups, funders, and government bodies. 

ICS was founded to reduce waste and encourage participation in local circular initiatives, which remain a key aspect of our day-to-day operations. We operate a hugely successful monthly Repair Café event at locations around London and house a Thing Library with over 500 items at our downtown London location. Our 2000 sq ft community space enables us to host community events of all types. 

Having dived down the web3 rabbithole, today ICS collaborates closely with SuperBenefit DAO, All In For Sport DAO, and other partners within the Reimagining Power Project. As part of that collaboration, ICS has established a multisig and governance structure in order to summon ICS DAO, which is the applicant for this round.

ICS is grateful to have received funding to support our work from national, provincial and foundations, as receiving an annual grant from the City of London to cover our core programs which contribute to London's Circular Economy Workplan. However, to date all of our web3 activities and explorations have received no funding and have been made possible largely through the generous voluntary donations of time and resources by contributors.

## **Why ICS Engages With Web3**

ICS is experimenting with decentralized governance models and novel blockchain-enabled funding mechanisms in order to enable community members and organizations to have more participation and ownerships in decision-making and funding flows.

We believe that blockchain technology offers a revolutionary way for communities to collaborate and steward resources in a transparent, accessible manner - without losing the personal, local-first approach that defines our work. 

We aim to promote and accelerate circular value flows and ensure that capital remains engaged in regenerative finance networks, reinforcing long-term local and global impact.

## **The Reimagining Power Project & The Role Of ICS**

The Reimagining Power Project (RPP) is an initiative, coordinated by SuperBenefit DAO, that explores how philanthropic and social-impact funding can be allocated through Web3, empowering communities and shifting traditional power dynamics. The two-year project wraps up in July 2025 and we are in discussions with funders regarding a possible Phase 2 of the project.

Key RPP Initatives include:

1. **Develop Community-Focused Governance Approaches**
   We're eating our own dog-food, co-creating practical governance frameworks that community groups can adopt, experimenting and iterating to make collective decision-making more inclusive, effective, and reflective of lessons learned from nature.

2. **Facilitate Cross-Border Financial Flows:** We're working with established global charities Equality Fund and Women Win to help route funding from philanthropic institutions to women's funds in high-risk countries with limited banking infrastructure, testing how blockchain can reduce costs, opacity and risk in financial transactions.

3. **Local Education & Workshops:** As part of the "Gatherings" program, the RPP hosts sessions introducing not-for-profits and other community partners to the potential of web3, demonstrating how these tools can be leveraged for social and environmental outcomes and hosting communities of practice to develop and mentor further experiments.

4. **Open-Source Documentation:** We're documenting lessons learned as patterns and playbooks in our open-source knowledge garden, developed in collaboration with community partners including Open Civics to ensure consistency and interoperability. We hope to assist and enable other communities around the world to replicate these experiments, avoid pitfalls, and tailor solutions to their local realities.

ICS serves as both a fiscal sponsor of the RPP - enabling $100k+ of funding to flow from traditional charitable foundations on-chain into DAOs - and an on-the-ground partner facilitating experiments with web3 tools and technologies and contributing to the cosmolocal knowledge commons.

As part of these experiments, this year alone ICS has co-sponsored the first ever GFAL (General Forum on Arts Localism) which took place in our city and which Griff and Lauren from Giveth participated in; summoned ICS DAO and established a mycelial, fractal-inspired governance structure and tooling stack; and helped to instantiate Greenpill London, the third Greenpill chapter in Canada.

## Circular Value Flows & On-Chain Funding

ICS is designing funding models that prioritize ongoing ecosystem sustainability rather than one-time grants. Our approach ensures that capital not only flows into Web3 but remains within regenerative finance networks, reinforcing long-term impact. A few examples of experiments we are currently operating and developing include:

- **DAO Governance & Capacity Building:** By engaging local organizations, global partners and our own organization and community in governance design and experimentation, we help them gain skills in decentralized coordination, treasury management, and impact verification, which strengthens local resilience and self-sufficiency.

- **Cross-Border On-Chain Transfers:** Through collaborations with philanthropic organizations and their global partners, ICS is facilitating blockchain-based funding routes that both reduce financial friction and give recipients access to DeFi primitives, ensuring that funds remain within the Web3 ecosystem. 

- **On-Chain Compensation for Local Contributors:** ICS is working to enable contributors and local organizations to receive compensation on-chain in Web3-native assets, prioritizing auto-PGF tokens and solidarity currencies such as $CELO, $GLO, and $BREAD.

- **Regenerative Resource Sharing:** As noted previously, our core Thing Library and Repair Café programs reinforce decentralized material stewardship and extend the lifecycle of materials, ensuring that physical goods circulate within communities instead of sitting idle or being discarded. 

- **Reinvestment Through Hypercerts & Attestations:** ICS is incorporating hypercerts and impact attestations, enabling funders, community members and partners to track both ecological and social impact. These mechanisms create pathways for reinvestment, where successful initiatives can receive renewed funding based on verifiable impact.

- **Open-Source Documentation & Playbooks:** ICS is contributing to the knowledge commons by sharing resources that empower communities to replicate and adapt successful experiments rather than reinventing the wheel. ICS brings an unusual perspective to the web3 regen commmunity thanks to its externsive real-world experience of running circular economy programs and community-building initiatives. As well, it has unique experience in the realm of on- and off-ramping crypto to fiat within the Canadian charitable and non-profit context.

- **Cultural & Localized Knowledge Exchange:** By hosting (and recording) workshops, gatherings, and decentralized decision-making processes, ICS ensures that value is not just financial but includes social trust, peer-to-peer support, and co-created knowledge. ICS and RPP contributors have recently participated in GFAL, GFEL, Eth Denver, and Funding the Commons, as well as engaging with the MycoFi, BioFi and Ethereum Localism movements and exploring hosting Canada's first GFEL later this year. Knowledge mobilization, developing collective wisdom, and vibing with values-aligned cryptohomies are fundamental to our ethos and praxis. 

## Synergies with Regen Coordination

The activities of ICS, especially within ICS DAO, align closely with Regen Coordination's North Stars. Specifically, we are engaged in:

- **Increasing ReFi Awareness & Adoption**: By bringing traditional organizations and funders into Web3 (including some of the largest foundations in Canada), we're broadening who's paying attention to regenerative finance, and helping them see its tangible, community-level benefits. At the same time, we are onboarding community members and grassroots environmental organizations into web3 through meetups and impact tracking.

- **Driving Meaningful On-Chain Activity**: ICS' involvement ensures that philanthropic capital doesn't just pass through Web3, but can stay engaged there - supporting both local governance pilots and cross-border initiatives over the long haul.

- **Fostering Local Ecological & Social Impact**: ICS has always focused on concrete community outcomes. We're using Web3 to amplify that impact, weaving in impact tracking (via hypercerts and attestations) and shared ownership of local projects.

The RPP and its contributors are already collaborating in various ways with Greenpill Network, Coordinape, Crypto Commons Association, Labour DAO, ReFi DAO, All in for Sport, BreadChain and OpenCivics, as well engaging in emerging conversations around Regen Coordination and Ethereum Localism.

Our most strongly-held wish is to deepen and broaden our collaborations and to function together with members of the global regen movement as one mycelial organism in service of planetary flourishing and joy and peace for all beings. A few (of many) potential collaboration vectors are:

- **Collaborate on Playbook Development:** ICS is currently developing playbooks that document reliable patterns and practices for implementing web3 governance models. These resources can be shared with Regen Coordination’s network to help other communities adopt and adapt these tools for their own contexts.

- **Expand Local Facilitation Networks:** By working with Regen Coordination, we can scale our community engagement efforts, ensuring that web3 tools and knowledge are rooted in and controlled by local communities. This aligns with the theme of building circular value flows within ecosystems, as we aim to onboard more communities to web3 and retain value within these networks.

- **Scale Ethereum Localism Initiatives:** ICS’s experiments with DAO-based governance and quadratic funding align closely with Ethereum Localism’s goals of embedding Ethereum-based tools into real-world local economies. We see opportunities to integrate our work with Regen Coordination’s efforts to pilot and scale these mechanisms, ensuring that web3 tools become an integral part of local ecosystems.

## Conclusion

The ICS is deeply aligned with Regen Coordination’s mission to drive regenerative ecological, social, and economic impact through decentralized coordination enabled by blockchain-based tools. 

We are excited about the potential for further collaboration with Regen Coordination and with all of the global regen movement to scale the impact of our work and drive meaningful change in the ReFi Web3 ecosystem and in the precious planet we share.

# Notes

Reading into the north star points, I'd say ICS clearly meets all 3 to some extent. But yeah your focus is definitely real-world impact.

The major theme of this round is building circular value flows within ecosystems. (Not offramping to local contributors as has been the norm)

So that means the scope can be a lot tighter and can fit perfectly within the RPP experiment. So we don't have to do any extra work for the grant.
