# Women Win Experiment Discussion

**Date/Time:** Tuesday, 4:30-5:00 PM ET

**Participants:** Heenal, Rowan, Nicole, Rather

## Purpose

To discuss the possibility of moving forward with a Women Win experiment, independently of progress with the Equality Fund experiment, now that fiscal sponsorship and $10,000 in matched funding has been secured for SuperBenefit.

## Agenda

### 0. Check-in (5 mins)

- How are you arriving?

### 1. Fiscal Sponsorship Update (10 mins)

- Review agreement details from Nicole

  - WW typically does fiscal sponsorship out of their Dutch entity (nonprofit entity). have been exploring fiscal sponsorship from US entity, but timing was not ideal, given the current environment.

  - Still moving forward with US fiscal sponsorship entity - we are looking for "model C" fiscal sponsorship - pass-through of funds. This should be ready soon. 

  - Usual admin fee is 8-10% but hoping to get this down for us


- Discuss intake process and next steps

  - nicole team draft agreement & send to ICS/RPP for review

  - heenal prepare wire transfer information

  - nicole find out from team what documentation and/or banking info is required from ICS

  - sign an on-chain agreement including WW, ICS & SB as a permanent record (like in windfall)

  - WW can transfer $ to any country - so we will explore opening a Canada based account for SB's Marshal Islands LLC

- Address any questions about the fiscal sponsorship arrangement

  - 

### 2. Women Win Experiment Planning (10 mins)

- Explore options for continuing/creating a Women Win experiment

  - GOAL: understand the flow of money on-chain and how that compares to off-chain. 

  - they have some flexibility as to how they run the experiment

  - there's some work to do convincing the two projects to get on board

  - they also have a much larger group of partners around the world who might be open to partnering on this. it would have to be in a country with relatively easy off-ramping

- Discuss how the $10K matched funding could support this initiative

  - the funding is unrestricted: is not towards a specific deliverable and no reporting is required

  - also unlocked some funding for a learning journey for womens funds CEOs and CFOs around the world - a session a month for 5 months, plus a one-day culminating convening

- Determine if we can move forward regardless of Equality Fund status

  - We can think of this as two independent yet interconnected experiments

  - Nicole ask finance team to identify 'low-hanging fruit' global partners. And then experiment design should flow eaisly from there.

  - Possibility of helping local groups set up and use web3 tooling, too

- There are many different governance structures for allocation of funds, decision making, peer review etc. 

### 3. Next Steps & Action Items (5 mins)

- Assign clear responsibilities for moving forward

- Set timeline for implementation

- Schedule any necessary follow-up meetings

## Key Questions to Address

- What specific aspects of a Women Win experiment are we most interested in exploring?

- What resources (beyond the $10K) would be needed to properly execute this experiment?

- How might this experiment connect with other SuperBenefit initiatives?

- What would success look like for this project?

- Who else should be involved as we develop this further?
