# Minutes

Project Proposal and Organizational Support

- A project proposal has been sent to Heenal for feedback. The proposal has received informal support from various parts of the organization.

- Preparation is underway to formally present it to unlock budget and determine specifics. There is excitement about the potential and appreciation for the support from Heenal and the team.


Funding Opportunities and Challenges in Web3 Space

- The initiative could potentially unlock funding from the Equality Fund and assist with other funding opportunities like Jumpstart.

- There are challenges in securing funding in the Web3 space, particularly for non-technical projects. There is a strong preference for technical and for-profit ventures in many funding calls.

- An unsuccessful application to the ENS x Octant Giveth QF round highlighted the need to better understand the expectations and language of such funding opportunities.

- Considering the development of a technical product aligned with their work as a strategic move to attract funding was suggested.

Bridging Technical and Non-Technical Expertise

- The gap between those with technical knowledge (developers) and those with ideas for use cases but lacking technical backgrounds was explored. There is a need for spaces or platforms that can connect these two groups.

- While formal spaces for such connections may not exist, there are developers willing to work on impactful projects, even for low or no upfront pay. Creating such a space ourselves to facilitate these connections was considered.

Blockchain for Good Summit and Incubation Program

- The Blockchain for Good Summit and their open call for an incubation program were reviewed

- Applying for such opportunities without a technical team or product presents challenges.

- The program offers a $10,000 grant and incubation support, which could be interesting for RPP or Super Benefit to explore.

Cryptocurrency Onboarding for Nonprofits

- Interest in testing capabilities for sending cryptocurrencies as a nonprofit was expressed.

- This would involve setting up a multisig wallet and finding an appropriate US-based cryptocurrency exchange.

- Understanding the financial reporting and auditing implications of using cryptocurrencies as a nonprofit organization was also discussed.

Fiscal Sponsorship for SuperBenefit

- SuperBenefit is still exploring and in need of fiscal sponsorship from a US 501c3 organization.

- A previous application requiring a US fiscal sponsor was unsuccessful.

- Having this option would open up new possibilities for funding and projects.

Community Resilience and Local Impact

- The importance of community resilience and the potential for blockchain and Web3 technologies to support this at a local level was touched upon.

- There is interest in onboarding interested communities to explore how these technologies could create better ways of supporting resilience, particularly in mitigating the impact of global funding shocks on local groups.

Reimagining Power Project Update

- A broad update on the Reimagining Power Project was provided.

- An extension to complete ongoing experiments, including the Equality Fund and ICS projects, has been received.

- Additional funding from OTF for a second phase had been hoped for, but political changes have delayed this possibility.

- Alternative funding sources are being sought to continue the work, facing a potential funding gap in the near future.
