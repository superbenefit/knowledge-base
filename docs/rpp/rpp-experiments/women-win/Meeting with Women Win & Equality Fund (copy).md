- [Team Meeting Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kXI90VxWF5yP_Y8rQIPOEqWGyEcxL_wOLqYC07WGzKs/edit?tab=t.0)

  - Welcome and Intros

  - Design of the grant disbursement mapping process

    - What elements of the financial flow are we mapping? What information do we want to collect? 

    - Forward plan: Who is doing what and when?

  - Welcome and Intros - Take 2!

  - Discussion of the design of the Web3 test

    - Brief overview of the EF+WW financial flow mapping process

    - Discussion of the design of the Web3 test (see questions emerging in our discussion document for reference)

      - Specifically, are we using a sandbox/testnet or could do very small transactions as a proof of concept?

---

# Decision Log

- The test will focus on mapping grant-making flows only, not all operational expenditures

- The scope will track money flow from Equality Fund to Women Win, and then from Women Win to grantee partners

- The test will use real money (approximately $100) rather than a sandbox environment

- The test money will be separate from actual grant disbursements and will be accounted for as part of the Reimagining Power Project

- Anya will create the first draft of the transaction protocol document mapping the financial flows

- Gloria will compile a list of countries where grant payments are currently being made to help determine test jurisdictions

- The team will strategically select which grantee partners to approach about participating in the test, starting with Dean and Newman funds

- A follow-up meeting will be scheduled for the second week of April to review progress

- While Equality Fund will explore opening a Web3 wallet, this process won't delay the test implementation

# Action Items

- [ ] Anya to create first draft of the transaction protocol document mapping out the financial flow from Equality Fund to Women Win, including transaction points and associated costs 

- [ ] Gloria to generate list of countries where grant payments are currently being made on behalf of Newman and Dean funds to help determine jurisdictions for the test

- [ ] Anya to put together initial mapping of financial flows from Equality Fund to Women Win, including bank fees, intermediary fees, exchange rates and other transaction costs

- [ ] Cammy to discuss with finance directors at Women Win about the feasibility of receiving and maintaining funds in digital currency versus converting to/from fiat currency

- [ ] Anya to explore possibility of opening a Web3 wallet for Equality Fund

- [ ] Sue to schedule a follow-up meeting for the second week of April to review progress

# Minutes

Project Overview and Objectives

- The Equality Fund, Women Win, and Super Benefit are collaborating on a test to explore Web3 opportunities for social transformation, specifically examining the potential of using decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology for grant payments.

- The primary objectives are to compare the financial costs of using traditional financial systems versus Web3 solutions and to assess the grantee partner experience of receiving grant money in digital format.

- The test aims to map out the financial flow from the Equality Fund to Women Win (acting as a fiscal sponsor) and then to the ultimate grantee partners, focusing specifically on grant-making transactions rather than all operational expenses.

Scope and Design of the Test

- The test will map the flow of funds from the Equality Fund to Women Win and then from Women Win to multiple jurisdictions where grantee partners are located.

- The scope is limited to on-granting flows, not including operational funding agreements with partners

- The team is considering using real money for the test, potentially around $100, to get accurate insights into the process.

- They are debating whether to use a sandbox environment or conduct the test with actual transactions, leaning towards the latter for more realistic results.

- The test will examine various costs associated with traditional financial transfers, including bank fees, intermediary fees, exchange rate losses, and the costs of returned payments.

Challenges and Considerations

- Several challenges and considerations were discussed, including the need for cryptocurrency accounts or wallets for participating organizations, which may require internal approvals and governance processes, especially for the Equality Fund.

- The varying abilities of grantee partners to receive and use digital currencies in different jurisdictions present additional challenges.

- There may be a potential need for Women Win to convert digital currencies back to traditional currencies for some grantee partners.

- It is important to test a range of scenarios, including both easy and difficult jurisdictions for off-ramping cryptocurrencies to local currencies.

- The team needs to identify and map potential risks in the process, especially at the point of converting digital currencies to local currencies.

Next Steps and Action Items

- The team agreed on the following next steps: The Equality Fund will draft the first version of the transaction protocol, outlining each transaction point and associated costs.

- Women Win will map out all the countries where payments are being made on behalf of their grantee partners.

- The team will strategically decide how many and which jurisdictions to include in the test, aiming for a range that provides diverse insights.

- They will reach out to specific partners like the Dean and Newman funds to gauge interest in participating in the test.

- Super Benefit will provide insights on testing different jurisdictions to understand various constraints and possibilities.

- The team will reconvene in the second week of April to review progress and discuss next steps.

Potential Benefits and Implications

- The team discussed several potential benefits of using Web3 solutions for grant payments, including reduced transaction costs, with some cryptocurrency transfers costing only fractions of a penny.

- There is a potential for faster and more efficient international transfers.

- Keeping funds in digital currencies throughout the process could potentially reduce exchange rate losses.

- The team is exploring alternative solutions for jurisdictions where direct cryptocurrency-to-local currency conversion is not possible, such as using crypto-linked debit cards or 'human ATMs.'

- The importance of understanding both the benefits and risks of this approach was emphasized, particularly in terms of accessibility, security, and regulatory compliance in different jurisdictions.

- They aim to gather data that will help them assess whether decentralized finance solutions could be viable and beneficial for their grant-making processes in the future.
