## Purpose 

This Experiment Facilitation Framework is for use in the RPP to support the design of experiments in partnership with Philanthropic organisations and other partners. 

It maps out the Discovery and Scoping steps in the Strategy laid out in the Experiment Coordination-RPP doc 

https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/experiment-coordination-rpp-9538483635114741

## Objectives

**1. Stakeholder Discovery**

> Note - rework this language to make sure that it reflects what is in the operational flow of the [coordination doc](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/experiment-coordination-rpp-9538483635114741)

Produce a **discovery report** that covers:

1. Mapping the state of the current system

2. Identifying systemic issues in the current system 


**2. Experiment Scoping**

1. Identify intervention areas where these systemic issues could be addressed and decide which opportunity or opportunities to pursue. 

2. Produce a scoping doc for an experiment (or set of experiments) to test these ideas and opportunities 

3. Produce a proposal that references the above scope that that can be passed by the RP core team and be picked up by a team of contributors to execute on. 

# Steps 

# Part 1 - Stakeholder Discovery 

**Framing**

This framework loosely follows the [Estuarine Mapping process ](https://cynefin.io/wiki/Estuarine_framework)for systems change. In this there is an emphasis on beginning by mapping a granular understanding of the current state of the system, agreed upon by everyone participating in the mapping. From here the map of the current system can yield different aspects of the system that hold the potential for change and the level of cost/difficulty in changing them. From this point of clarity and agreement it is then relatively straight-forward to agree on what to do (strategy). 

> Note - This approach assumes that systems (and solutions) will be in the realm of complexity, where experimentation and observation is needed to see how a system responds to change (emergent properties), rather than traditional approaches that assume that the results of an intervention can be predicted based solely on inputs to the system as in non-complex systems. Because we are working with concepts like network intelligence we have to assume that these systems are complex and act accordingly.

### **1. Map the state of the current system**

Gather stakeholders who want to participate in the design of the experiment into a workshop setting to work through the mapping process. This can be done in a single workshop with all stakeholders present. Ideal group size is 6 or less. 

> Note - If the stakeholders don't represent a diverse enough set of perspectives from across the system being mapped, consider bringing other voices into the session, or conducting research conversations in advance so that these missing perspectives can be represented in the conversation. It may be that time/logistical/access doesn't not allow for a broad enough group of stakeholders to be present while keeping the overall group size small enough to be effective. Also, some of the voices that are needed for the discovery to be effective will not be the same voices that want to participate in the actual mapping process as stakeholders. We need to manage these factors and design the process to not miss vital perspectives from across the system. An output from the session may be that there are still perspectives missing from the process. That's okay, just figure out how to include these voices in the process. 

  

Map the philanthropic systems that you want to explore (or the pieces of them that you are interested in exploring).

- Describe the particular systems that you are exploring using the [linked](https://www.figma.com/board/ct2DHgl4NjNEyqOadB13ml/Reimagining-Power---Project-Planning?node-id=0-1&t=OyyMlg4ym2EwK2Ag-1) diagram as a starting point. We are trying to understand how the different processes in a philanthropic flow fit together:

  - How capital moves through layers in the stack to eventually reach communities/beneficiaries

  - How information moves between the layers in the system to inform the different decision-making and risk management functions in the system

  - The particular system you are mapping may not have the same number of layers or might describe the layers differently, that's okay. We are just looking to accurately map what the current system looks like.

- We recommend using a shared whiteboarding tool like figjam to do this mapping. Create a simple grid to capture each layer in the different systems or feel free to copy and paste the empty template in the [RPP figjam](https://www.figma.com/board/ct2DHgl4NjNEyqOadB13ml/Reimagining-Power---Project-Planning?node-id=0-1&t=24nOfIg8mOxm92kr-1)

- Do separate maps for different systems that you want to map, even if they are within the same org. This will allow them to stay clean and uncluttered 

- The diagram above can help you understand the different functions that each layer in the system contributes across - participants

- When you have a clear map (or maps) that everyone can agree on it is time to work on identifying the systemic issues in this current system. 

### **2. Identify systemic issues in the current system**

> Note - the deeper the exploration into the issues in the system the richer the opportunity space to intervene will become. If much of the sense-making around issues in the system has already been done, then the process below can be relatively straight forward. However if this is being approached afresh, then it is likely that this step in the discovery would benefit from a deeper sense-making process facilitation. The choice of process will depend on desire/interest from participants, available time, resources/funding etc. Some possible suggested process can be found here  

- Identify patterns in the current system that cause the system to produce poor outcomes. Specifically, where do systems of power impede the system's ability to be collectively intelligent? 

- Map the facets of the system that cause these issues to arise. Map them next to the diagram that you already have 

  - Some useful framing for how negative systems of power might be identified can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_IrLE7_pIarOFuD1vpIKPbiG36943v-p/view)

- Look to understand how these facets interact through the different layers. Why does the system work this way?

  - Why did it evolve to produce a particular dynamic?

  - What risks are being mitigated by the current composition of the system?

  - What forces are at work to keep the system in this state? 

> Note - it is likely that the system has negative power dynamics as a result of a lack of network intelligence i.e the systems of power have emerged as a consequence of a attempts to safeguard against risks caused by insufficient information. The overall design goal is to experiment on redesigning information flows and systems of power together to arrive at systems that are both more intelligent and more balanced in terms of power with these two facets being mutually reinforcing.


### **3. Discovery Report**

Produce a short report that documents this discovery process, mapping of the current system and systemic issues that can be shared with the RPP core team and other interested stakeholders.
 - here is an example discovery report for reference.

# Part 2 - Design the experiment

### 1. Identify intervention areas where these systemic issues could be addressed

**a. Arising out of the above mapping, what ways might we reimagine the system?**

  - Where can agency, voice, power etc be distributed differently in the system?

  - How can this make the system more collectively intelligent?

  - How can it make the system better able to make decisions that include information, input, participation and ownership from those closer to the reality of the impact that the system is trying to have?

> Note - often the communities who are best placed to produce the intelligence that the system needs will not have the capacity to engage with it (even if mechanisms for them to engage have been presented). This is an important design constraint and why genuine engagement with affected communities needs to be at the heart of solutions design.

**b. Identify the highest potential opportunities?**

  - Where is there good alignment and crossover between stakeholders (i.e desire + resources) to make something happen?

  - Where are the cost/time gradients such that changing the system could have a good chance of succeeding?

  - Where can Web3 patterns (tools and practices) offer the high leverage opportunities? Ultimately RPP is looking for ways to leverage open digital protocols and more decentralised approaches of power to make systems more intelligent, more equitable and more impactful. Where can these tools and practices connect funders and communities in a new stack that reimagines the way capital and information flows through the system?

  - Which Web3 patterns can we implement as solutions?

    - Links to pattern libraries/resources, refiDAO, create our own


**c. Decide** 

  - Decide which opportunity the group wants to pursue

  - If sections a & b are done well there will likely be an obvious experiment candidate 

> Note - there is a good chance that you will need to move through sections a & b several times as insights from section b make you reconsider your initial thinking about the possible intervention areas and innovation that could be brought to them. If there is disagreement about which intervention to choose, the it is likely that there has been a lack of clarity or granularity in sections a & b. Go back and reassess these sections and unpack contentious or unclear points/ideas until there is shared understanding. 

### 2. Develop a scope 

Develop a scoping document for the experiment that will form the basis for a proposal to the RP core team to fund and execute the experiment.   

- Template - Use the linked scoping template:

[https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/scoping-template-3795782680070612](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/rp-scoping-template-7012835498787378)

[https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/rp-scoping-template-7012835498787378](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/rp-scoping-template-7012835498787378)

### 3. Propose an experiment charter

Draft and propose a task that that references the above scope document.  

- Proposals can be found [here](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/proposals)

- Use an experiment charter proposal template (TBC)

- Notify the core team of the proposal in the [RP core team discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/874697948838101092/1182281729453596764)
