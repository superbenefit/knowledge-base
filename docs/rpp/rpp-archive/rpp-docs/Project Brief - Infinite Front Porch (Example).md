# Infinite Front Porch Project Briefing Document (DRAFT)

**AI agent swarms to transform community knowledge**

In an increasingly digital world, vast reservoirs of human knowledge and wisdom remain untapped because they exist beyond the reach of current technology. The Infinite Front Porch project aims to bridge this gap by creating a network of AI agents that work with human partners to gather, preserve, and share knowledge from traditionally excluded sources. 

By combining breakthrough AI capabilities with community-owned infrastructure, we are building a system where communities maintain control of their knowledge while participating in meaningful exchange with others, transforming how we collectively understand and address global challenges.

## Background

The convergence of AI agent technology and crypto infrastructure has created an unprecedented opportunity to reimagine how knowledge is gathered, shared, and preserved across human and ecological communities. While current approaches to knowledge systems predominantly serve those already represented in digital spaces, they systematically exclude billions of people, marginalized communities, oral traditions, indigenous wisdom, and the voice of nature itself. 

While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful new capabilities for accessing and interpreting fragmented datasets, the dominant model pushed by major providers requires channeling the world's information through centralized systems. This approach perpetuates existing power structures and risks further consolidating control over global knowledge.

However, the Infinite Front Porch project emerges from a growing movement to develop locally-operated (local-first) AI agents that maintain community data sovereignty. By combining local-first agents with Web3 infrastructure—including permissionless blockchains and privacy-preserving zero knowledge proofs—we enable granular control over how knowledge is owned, shared, and protected. This synthesis creates a pathway to unlock the untapped potential of community knowledge while ensuring communities retain genuine sovereignty over their information. It can gather and honor knowledge from the edges of our networks, while ensuring genuine community ownership and data sovereignty.

### Core Concept and Vision

_Crypto-enabled, local-first AI agent swarms to unlock community knowledge and wisdom_

Our vision is to create an "infinite front porch" - a network of sovereign AI agents dedicated to discovering, preserving, and sharing knowledge that exists beyond traditional digital boundaries.

Each community has an AI agent that can understand and generate insights from the community's aggregated data (knowledge and wisdom from various sources). These agents can then be coordinated as a swarm, in ways that give people access to the collected knowledge and wisdom from across a whole network of communities.

Unlike closed models that perpetuate opacity and exclusivity, these agent networks will be specifically designed to be a bridge between communities, where all beings and all stories, including from underrepresented sources, are not just welcome, but are essential.

The system empowers communities to maintain full ownership of their data while participating in meaningful knowledge-sharing networks. By building infrastructure for decentralized data interoperability, we aim to create a regenerative and equitable process for knowledge creation that nurtures collective intelligence. This approach allows organizations and communities to determine their own levels of data sharing and sovereignty, creating a flexible framework that respects diverse needs while ensuring ethical engagement and mutual benefit.

### Strategic Rationale

The timing for this initiative is particularly compelling due to several converging factors. Recent breakthroughs in open-source AI agents and crypto infrastructure have made decentralized knowledge sharing not just theoretically possible, but practically achievable. While traditional approaches to data interoperability typically require surrendering control to central authorities, our approach maintains community sovereignty through crypto rails and agent-mediated sharing.

Importantly, we recognize that the network effects of many small, sovereign agents working in concert could potentially surpass the capabilities of a few large centralized systems. This insight challenges the conventional wisdom that data consolidation is necessary for creating value, suggesting instead that a more democratic and distributed approach might actually yield superior results.

### Stakeholder Benefits

This project offers multiple tangible benefits to participating organizations and communities:

**Data Sovereignty:** Communities maintain complete control over their data, determining what is shared and how it is used. This sovereignty extends beyond simple access control to include governance over the ways their information can be interpreted and applied.

**Selective Sharing:** Organizations can share specific insights while maintaining privacy and control over sensitive information. The agent-mediated approach allows for nuanced sharing policies that can be adjusted based on context and relationships.

**Economic Opportunity:** Communities can potentially earn income from their knowledge sharing, creating sustainable models for community-driven information exchange. This represents a shift from traditional extractive models to one where value flows back to knowledge creators.

**Enhanced Collaboration:** The agent network enables more efficient collaboration across organizations, reducing the friction typically associated with cross-organizational knowledge sharing. This efficiency is achieved without requiring organizations to compromise their autonomy or data sovereignty.

**Reduced Complexity:** By using AI agents to mediate data sharing, we significantly reduce the technical complexity traditionally associated with data interoperability projects. This makes sophisticated knowledge sharing accessible to a broader range of organizations, regardless of their technical capabilities.

**Democratic Access:** The system provides democratic access to AI capabilities, ensuring that advanced technology serves the needs of communities rather than merely extracting value from them. This democratization is essential for ensuring that the benefits of AI advancement are broadly distributed.

## Implementation Approach

Our approach combines proven technical frameworks with practical implementation strategies, supported by an established network of partnerships and identified funding pathways. This comprehensive strategy ensures we can move from concept to execution efficiently while maintaining our commitment to community sovereignty and ethical knowledge gathering.

### Technical Architecture 

Underpinning the concept of the Infinite Front Porch is what we describe as a crypto-enabled, local first, AI agent Swarm: 

- **_Crypto-enabled_**_ - utilizing blockchain and zero knowledge proof technologies to secure and permission data._

- **_Local-first_**_ - data is kept "locally" under the control of the community group/organization, not given over to a third party._ 

- **_AI agent_**_ - pieces of software that leverage LLMs to carry out specific purposes. Agents have long-term memory, intent and the ability to take action towards that intent._

- **Swarm** - _a collection of AI agents that can be coordinated, giving users access to the best knowledge, information and functionality possessed by the agents that make up the swarm._ 


The technical foundation of our project builds upon existing, battle-tested agent frameworks such as ELIZA, emphasizing modularity and simplicity over complexity. We employ a plugin-based architecture that enables straightforward agent communication while maintaining flexibility for future expansion. This approach allows us to create specialized, focused agents rather than attempting to build monolithic systems, aligning with our vision of distributed, community-oriented knowledge sharing.

Our architecture leverages swarm protocols to facilitate agent-to-agent communication, creating a robust network that can adapt to varying levels of data sharing and sovereignty requirements. 

We leverage a combination of permissionless blockchains and [zero knowledge proof](https://chain.link/education/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp?utm_source=chatgpt.com) technologies to manage the storing and sharing of data within the system. Through this we ensure that governance and ownership structures are embedded at the protocol level, providing genuine sovereignty rather than merely superficial control. These technologies allow for granular control of permissions and data ownership as well as censorship protections for communities participating in an agent swarm.  

For knowledge management, we utilize established documentation tools such as GitBook, allowing us to build upon existing infrastructure rather than creating entirely new systems. This approach reduces technical barriers to entry while ensuring compatibility with current organizational practices.

### Implementation Strategy

Our implementation follows a measured, iterative approach beginning with a small network of three to four partner organizations. This initial phase will focus on internal testing using the Super Benefit knowledge base, allowing us to refine our methodologies before expanding to additional partners. Through this process, we will develop comprehensive playbooks and documentation, creating a clear pathway for future organizations to join the network.

A key innovation in our approach is the development of agents capable of deploying other agents, streamlining the onboarding process for new organizations. This self-replicating capability, combined with our focus on practical experimentation and iterative development, enables us to scale efficiently while maintaining quality and consistency.

Our methodology emphasizes learning through doing, with each deployment providing valuable insights that feed back into our development process. This approach ensures that our solutions remain grounded in practical reality while continuously evolving to meet community needs.

## Project Focus Areas

Our project concentrates on three interconnected areas that together create a comprehensive framework for community-driven knowledge sharing and ecological stewardship. Each focus area builds upon established work while pushing boundaries in both technical innovation and social impact.

### Stakeholder Engagement and Implementation

Building upon two years of intensive community engagement, we have developed a deep understanding of how organizations can effectively adopt and benefit from AI agent technology. Our approach emphasizes practical implementation over theoretical discussion, ensuring that communities can quickly begin realizing value from their participation in the network.

We recognize that the adoption of AI agent technology requires both technical capability and cultural understanding. To address this, we are developing specialized agents that can effectively demonstrate and explain the technology to different stakeholders. These educational agents will serve as bridges, helping organizations understand both the technical aspects and the broader implications of participating in a sovereign knowledge network.

Our comprehensive playbooks and resources will guide organizations through the process of implementing and managing their own agents. These materials will cover everything from initial setup to advanced usage scenarios, ensuring that organizations of all technical capabilities can participate effectively. By focusing on practical implementation rather than theoretical frameworks, we help stakeholders move quickly from understanding to action.

### Ecological Intelligence and Representation

Our eco-agent initiative represents a groundbreaking approach to incorporating nature's voice into decision-making processes. This work connects directly with emerging legal frameworks that recognize the personhood of natural entities, creating a technological infrastructure that can support and enhance these legal innovations.

Through collaboration with projects like [Gaia AI](https://linktr.ee/gaiaaiagent), we are developing frameworks that enable AI agents to serve as technological representatives for natural entities. These eco-agents will help translate ecological data and patterns into insights that can inform decision-making processes, ensuring that nature's interests are represented in community governance.

A key innovation in this area is the integration with permanent capital structures designed for environmental protection. By connecting eco-agents with these financial mechanisms, we create sustainable systems for funding environmental stewardship while ensuring that decision-making remains aligned with ecological interests.

### Community Knowledge Swarms

The concept of the "infinite front porch" forms the heart of our approach to community knowledge sharing. Unlike traditional knowledge management systems that prioritize centralization and standardization, our approach creates an interconnected network that preserves the unique character and sovereignty of each community's knowledge while enabling meaningful collaboration.

This system allows communities to share specific insights while maintaining strict control over their privacy and data sovereignty. The agent-mediated sharing approach means that communities can participate in knowledge exchange without compromising their autonomy or cultural integrity. Through careful framework design, we ensure that knowledge sharing remains beneficial to all participants while protecting sensitive or sacred information.

Our work builds upon existing knowledge gardens and documentation systems, integrating them into a broader network through AI agents. These agents create bridges between different knowledge systems, enabling communities to share insights across cultural and organizational boundaries while maintaining their preferred documentation approaches.

The framework we are developing supports robust bioregional knowledge sharing and organization. This approach recognizes that many crucial insights are deeply tied to specific places and ecological contexts. Our agent network helps surface and share these location-specific insights while maintaining their connection to place and community.

Through these interconnected focus areas, we are creating a system that not only preserves and shares knowledge but also enhances our collective ability to understand and address complex challenges. By bringing together human intelligence, artificial intelligence, and ecological intelligence, we create new possibilities for collaborative problem-solving and community empowerment.

**_Rowan's original  concept note (deprecated but keep for the time being for editing the long version doc)_**

### **_Introduction_** 

_We propose creating a multi-agent AI swarm that will opens up access to community data while keeping communities in full control of their information. This proof of concept will serve as the foundation for a broader network of community organizations that share, combine, and leverage data and knowledge to drive positive outcomes._

### _Context_ 

_Most of the world’s data remains locked in isolated silos, limiting its overall usefulness—especially for community organizations. High costs and risks associated with making data interoperable mean that only large corporations or dominant Web2 platforms can effectively aggregate data, while smaller communities lose ownership and control when contributing to these centralized systems._

_Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) create opportunities to tap into fragmented datasets through more flexible interfaces that can solve this interoperability problem. Yet the model being pushed by the major model providers in the LLM world, is one that will require all of the world's data to pass through a handful of giant centralized players in order to access these interoperability benefits._

_Counter to this narrative, there is currently a movement to develop AI agents that operate locally, keeping data in the hands and ownership of users. In addition, Web3 infrastructure —using open permissionless blockchains combined with privacy-preserving [zero knowledge proof technology](https://chain.link/education/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp?utm_source=chatgpt.com) — enables data to be owned, shared, and protected in granular ways. Combining these two advances creates the opportunity to unleash the untapped power of community data in a way that avoids the pitfalls of current data-hoarding models by preserving community sovereignty and control._

_COMMENT_

_"Web3 infrastructure —using open permissionless blockchains combined with privacy-preserving [zero knowledge proof technology](https://chain.link/education/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)" - this part is important, but it's not included/explained in the implementation section below and the connection between AI and web3 might not be clear to the reader._

### _Concept_ 

_The emergence of local-first AI agent swarms offers a different model for communities to aggregate and use their data in powerful ways, without sacrificing ownership or privacy. A local-first AI agent swarm is made of several concepts:_ 

1. **_Local-first_**_ - means that data is kept "locally" under the control of the user (community group/organization), not given over to a third party._ 

2. **_AI agent_**_ - a piece of software that leverages LLMs to carry out a specific purpose. They have long-term memory, intent and the ability to take action towards that intent._ 

3. **_Swarm_**_ - a collection of AI agents that can act as one, giving users access to the best knowledge, information and functionality possessed by the agents that make up the swarm._ 

_This design preserves the powerful network effects of large-scale data sharing while allowing communities to retain ownership. It also opens new avenues for organizations to develop revenue models around their valuable data._ 

_The partners on this project have individually been developing repositories of knowledge resources that relate to Web3 governance and civic organizing. We will be creating an agent swarm that takes thisthese currently disconnected these repositories of community knowledge and makes them interoperable and accessible._ 

### _Implementation_ 

_SuperBenefit, in partnership with All in for Sport, OpenCivics, and other communities, will develop a local-first agent swarm. This begins by creating a dedicated AI agent for each partner's community network. Each agent will have access to the community's document repositories and will be trained to query these documents to return primitives, practices, frameworks, playbooks, guides, case studies and other useful institutional knowledge. Each agent will be owned and managed by its community and will be designed to serve their needs and protect their data. At any point, communities can easily change or update their agent or remove it from the swarm._

_The partnership will develop an interaction protocol to coordinate the swarming of the agents. This provides the communication mechanism and the coordination strategy for the swarm, which allows the system to query all of the agents in the swarm and derive responses based on the best information existing across the whole network._

_When the system is up and running, it will offer a simple interface through which people can access and query the collective Web3 governance, operational, and civic organizing knowledge generated by all of the participating communities._

### _Evolution_

_Beyond this first proof of concept, the swarm will be improved, increasing its scope and usefulness, as well as increasing the numbers of community networks (and therefore the amount of aggregated data/knowledge) that the system can draw from._

_As these kinds of networks grow, more data leads to more valuable insights. These positive network effects, coupled with participating communities having the opportunity to wrap a revenue model around their agent and their data, create a genuine possibility of disrupting the existing data monoliths of our current economic system. Replacing them with systems that share the ownership and value of data across the communities that create it._

### _Next Steps_ 

_SuperBenefit and its partners are already building shareable knowledge repositories and experimenting with AI agents. The next phase involves formalizing the project partnerships, identifying additional community collaborators, and coordinating the design and development of both the individual agents and the agent swarm coordination protocol._

_Can we add something here about timelines, resources needed, scope/metrics for the pilot/proof of concept, and the possibility of future propagation and/or monetization?_
