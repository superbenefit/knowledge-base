**July 4, 2023**
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:45.800
Michelle Baldwin (she/her):  okay, well, we're recording. And yes, we're quite excited to have Sue Snyder here from a quality fund who is going to share about participatory grant making and your journey and this came about because we were, you know chatting about some of this work around mobilizing and distributing capital and recognize that there's lots of you know, kind of

5
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:55.539
Michelle Baldwin (she/her): learning and opportunity to chat to some folks who have done that, and in particular with you, who's thinking about the disco and what is

6
00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:11.250
Michelle Baldwin (she/her): possible. And so yeah, so just walking us through a little bit of your journey, because I think sometimes we're kind of jumping to the what can we do now? And it'll be fun to hear a little bit about what? What brought you to this moment? And so yeah, so over to you.

7
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:30.639
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: Okay, well, thanks for having me. I have 2 boys, 2 little boys who are home right now, so we might give visitors. We might not. I think I've distracted them for an hour. But I'm not 100% sure. So we'll just kind of roll with whatever with whatever happens today. And I think I'll share screen

8
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.620
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: if that's okay with everyone.

9
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:43.659
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So I've been really excited about being a part of conversations around Web 3, and kind of what's becoming possible with Web 3. As it relates to

10
00:01:43.790 --> 00:02:12.100
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: power, as it relates to community and culture. as it relates to scale. So those are the big areas that I'm I do a lot of thinking around. I head up strategy, innovation and impact of the Equality Fund and web. 3 kind of sits beautifully at the intersections of all of those things that I do so always excited to kind of be in community with colleagues around the world that are thinking about

11
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.400
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: how this might unfold and what kind of impact it could have.

12
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:33.519
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: I think my my very kind of quick presentation today and then open to questions throughout, or you know, towards the end. But really this kind of I think what strikes me most about being at the Equality Fund, and particularly the work that we're doing around Web 3

13
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.700
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: and and exploring how we could transform participatory grant making

14
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.100
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: is around like asking questions. And what we've realized is that

15
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.089
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: if you're asking the wrong questions, you're going to get the wrong answers. So we're spending quite a bit of time

16
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.089
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: trying to make sure that we're kind of asking what we think are our beautiful questions.

17
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:13.190
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: And from my perspective, I kind of start out with questions around, you know, what do we mean by innovation, because the Equality Fund has come at this idea of Web 3. Through an innovation cycle that we've done internally, we run, we run an innovation studio inside the Equality Fund.

18
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:34.110
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: and our Grant making team came to the innovation team and said, Listen, we'd like you to run an innovation cycle which they which we're always happy to do. And they said, We're we want to think about what it might look like to transform participatory grant making, because the Equality Fund started about 3 years ago, 3 and a half years ago. Our Grant portfolio for the first

19
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:58.650
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: year was about $500,000, and we just finished our third year of operations and rat 20 million. So what works at a small scale doesn't necessarily work in the same way at a large scale. And like, what does that mean? Right? Like, what elements are we learning about participatory grant making? But we're really trying to think about what is the next?

20
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:10.600
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: like, kind of what's the next iteration of what's becoming possible. And at the quality fun we think about innovation, we think about like, how can we reimagine the world in new and better ways.

21
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:22.310
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: I have to say that this has been the most exciting and difficult part for me. Joining the Equality fund. I'm hitting almost my fifth year now. There, I can't really believe that. But time flies, especially with Covid sometimes.

22
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:29.830
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So I think when I joined the equality fund as kind of a semi semi feminist I would call myself

23
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:41.810
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: I I kind of reflected on my career at the time, and I had. I had been in as a a consultant for about 25 years, a consultant, a lawyer all these lovely you know, management iterations.

24
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.370
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: and

25
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:52.400
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: I had kind of oriented my career to like, what do I need to do to be successful? in my career? And what I realized at the Equality Fund is like.

26
00:04:52.520 --> 00:05:07.589
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: maybe this world that I'm trying to be successful in isn't actually the world that I want and like. Do I want to be successful in a world that perhaps is gonna take a hundred years to reach gender equality. Well, maybe there's something about that world, but perhaps

27
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.530
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: isn't really functioning pro properly like, am I really asking the right question? Right like.

28
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:27.670
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: you know, my question was, how can I be successful in this world? But I my question has now become? Is this the type of world in which I want to be successful? And I think that's really driving me. Is is this permission inside the Equality Fund

29
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:47.850
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: to assume that things are broken, even though they're deep seeded, even though, you know, we have lots of lots of patterns and lots of lots of ways of working or leadership approaches that we've all been doing for years and years and years. it's an exciting place to be, because I think there's lots of interest in re-abaging and rethinking things.

30
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.869
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So one example of this is, you know, sometimes when we talk about power, we talk about shifting power.

31
00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:10.649
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: And the Equality Fund is primarily based in the global north, we're a Canadian based Women's Fund, and we move money around the world primarily in the global south to women's organizations around the world, working on gender equality and at the intersections of gender equality and other

32
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:26.980
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: areas like climate and digital and violence and things like that. So when we started thinking about participatory grant making, we, we kind of adopted this language about, how do we shift power to feminist activists in the global South through participatory grant making approaches.

33
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:40.549
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: And what we realized is that like, that is just a very colonial mindset around the power that like, it assumes that we in the global north have the power, and we're shifting it to our colleagues in the global South.

34
00:06:40.670 --> 00:07:01.670
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: And like what we really have in the global north, inside of a women's fund is money, and people equate money with power. But I think how we're now trying to think about power is around, you know, asking a better question, right like, not the kind of colonial. How do we shift our power to them? But how do we amplify the power that fem this activist and movements already have.

35
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:21.190
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: Because we all want gender equality. We all want to achieve, you know, greater impact and momentum around gender equality. And you know the women who are doing that are the ones that that own the power, the wisdom, the experience we happen to have money that we're able to mobilize in the global north. But that's just one small part of the equation.

36
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:37.919
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So I won't go into all of these questions. I'm happy to send my slides out. afterwards. But these are some of the questions that came up when we designed an innovation cycle around. You know, how might we transform participatory grant making at scale?

37
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:56.740
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: You know, questions came up around, you know, how. How might an organization or an activist, you know, gain value beyond just the financial outcome. Can we think of a participatory grant making process that doesn't have winners and losers only based on what a financial outcome might be.

38
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:19.189
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: I've talked a little bit about power and how we're reorienting ourselves to power. You know, how do we honor ways that participants want to contribute without taking advantage of them. We think a lot about the care economy, and how women often volunteer time and aren't compensated for the time that that they put in. So how can we design a participatory grant making process that

39
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.679
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: isn't taking advantage of labor?

40
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:43.519
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: How do we simultaneously lift up community. While also celebrating diversity and differences. We're thinking of a grant making portfolio across many regions and countries around the world. I think we move money right now into about 85 countries. We have direct grant making relationships with about 90 women's organizations around the world.

41
00:08:43.520 --> 00:09:08.930
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: And then we also fund other women's funds, and they fund over 500 on grants with our money. So there's a massive kind of multiplier effect of what we do. And that's an example. I think of our our approach around like, how do we lift up community? But then we also move a lot of our money to sister funds, who can do different and more diverse things. reach hard to reach groups. that speak different types of languages.

42
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:24.779
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: how do we ensure? You know there's transparency and fairness in the process. And how do we use participatory grant making to foster and strength and trust amongst our peers? So those are some of the questions that we're grappling with. And I think that is, that's really grounding

43
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:52.180
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: the outcome of the innovation process, which is like, Hey, maybe this whole web. 3 thing is something we should be thinking about, because a lot of the languages we're using around participatory grant making. I talked to Michelle and I talked to Bro, and like they're using the same language around dows and discos and power and governance and participation. so it it feels like kind of an exciting intersection between the work we're doing around participatory grant making and the work that our colleagues in the Web 3 space are doing.

44
00:09:52.450 --> 00:10:16.839
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: I would say that we have lots and lots of interest and excitement and experience with participatory grant making. And we have 0 experience, or even talent or competency in Web 3. So that's part of the reason why. I think this this partnership is really exciting, because, hopefully, we have something to offer the community, and we certainly have a lot of things that the community, I think, can can help us with.

45
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:33.530
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So again, one of the questions that we start out with is, you know, how can we make competitive funding models better for our grantee partner community? So when we launch 3 and a half years ago, we were launching and designing new funding streams every year. So the first funding stream that we launched is called catalyze.

46
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:44.400
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: and we wanted to learn from, you know these horrible competitive processes where you have to put mass amounts of time and effort into an application only to realize that you're not going to get anything out of it.

47
00:10:44.850 --> 00:11:02.569
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So what we did is we designed a process that really focused on a a light touch organizational profile. So we put out a call to the community. We had 950 organizational profiles. submitted that that kind of our granting criteria of the type of organizations that we grant to.

48
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:24.090
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: we whittle those down to about 300. We shortlisted 70 for a full application. And then we move those 70 applications through a participatory process to a global advisory panel. And the global advisory panel made the ultimate decision around who was going to receive that round of funding. And we ended up funding 30 women's organizations.

49
00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:41.250
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: And so we felt that this was kind of successful, because instead of having 950 or 300 organizations putting together long detailed applications. We only had about 70 and it was, you know, a little under a 50% success rate at that point.

50
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:57.759
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: But in the end, when we actually really step back and look at the numbers, we're still only at 3% success rate. Right? If we start out with over 300 out at 900 applications, and we fund 30. Then we're at a 300 success rate. Now, that's partly reflective of the demand.

51
00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:10.849
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: like. There is just so much demand from women's organizations for funding that they have hard, a hard time accessing. And there's just not enough money in the world moving through women's funds to support them. So part of that is a is a supply and demand issue.

52
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:21.320
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: But you know, we started out with a question, how can we make competitive funding funding models better for our grantee partner community? And I think we did that in an iterative sense, with our catalyzed funding stream.

53
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:30.729
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: But then we said, Well, like, are we asking the right question? And so a better or more beautiful question we decided to ask is a little bit more fundamental, like

54
00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:53.600
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: our competitive funding model. Successful as a first principle like, do we really have to compete? And what does that competition look like? And what are the unintended consequences of competition inside of an ecosystem? So we've really been trying to rethink what it means and what questions we're asking around our grant making process.

55
00:12:53.750 --> 00:13:01.699
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So as we started to unpack this, as we were starting to design a new funding stream specific to funds moving to other women's funds around the world.

56
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:23.399
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: we said, like, what would it look like to design a grant making stream that's rooted in non competitiveness, solidarity, radical love and transparency. So those that's kind of the community and culture and values that we were wrapping ourselves around as a first principle. And then we thought, if we start with these. Then what what becomes possible if this is what we're starting out with.

57
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:29.789
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: And so we decided to do a non competitive process. And everybody kind of looked like this like

58
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:38.640
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: there is. There is so much funding scarcity in the world. There is no way that if you oh, hey, Luke. hey! Are you going to tennis?

59
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:47.579
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: Okay? Well, it's okay. I'm just finishing my presentation. Okay? Well, I'm finishing it down.

60
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:48.660
Okay.

61
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:55.139
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: yeah, okay. I'm right in the middle of it, and you know what it's getting recorded. So let's not record any more.

62
00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:13.639
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So this is what I at least I want to on a funny screen. this is what everybody kind of looked at us like, they said, like there is absolutely no way when there is such an orientation to funding scarcity for women's organizations and for gender equality, that there is going to be a pot of money put on the table.

Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So these are sisters.

76
00:16:33.070 --> 00:17:02.899
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: and I can tell you we are not the big sister in this community. We are the kind of young and up and coming Canadian Women's Fund, and there's lots of women's funds in this community that have been in operations longer than the Equality Fund has. So you know, it's a delicate process of reaching out to your community with a certain amount of power and responsibility around that power associated with money, but also handing over a a massive amount of design power, I think, around a funding stream to say, Hey, like.

77
00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:24.000
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: what do you think about this kind of radical love and non competitive? And how can we use this money to build up the feminist funding ecosystem, instead of just building up individual women's funds and having winners and losers. So we collectively agreed on kind of the pric, the priorities and the criteria for that first round of funding that went out about a year and a half ago.

78
00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:39.679
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: and then the second. Once we identified what the criteria of the funding was, the second step was for each fund to determine if they were going to step up for funding and step back, and the idea was that if you step up you get money, and if you step back you're stepping back from the process, at least for this round

79
00:17:39.990 --> 00:18:00.299
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: and part of what the women's funds decided at the time around design criteria is, they felt that emerging funds and national funds should be given priority for this money because they have the hardest time attracting funding into their organizations regional, larger regional funds and global funds like the Equality Fund.

80
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:18.600
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: they tend to be large enough to attract and have, you know, a long enough track record to be able to attract international funds into their organizations. But local women's funds that are national in scope or emerging. Women's funds that have been around for less than 5 years have a very, very difficult time attracting international

81
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:38.270
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: donors. So as a community, the women's funds. Community said, Yeah, we all need money, but we're stronger. If there's more women's funds that are moving money out there in the world. So if we don't move women's funds to some of the national and emergent funds, then some of these funds might actually not be in existence in a few years.

82
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:53.000
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So let's really prioritize these, you know, colleagues inside of our ecosystem, so that they have the the support that they need over the next few years to continue to get bigger and stronger, and perhaps then be in a position to attract international funds.

83
00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:57.149
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: and in that sense we're all better off together. Right?

84
00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:26.339
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So We had funds that stepped up, that we had funds that stepped back, and then we also had this like behind the scenes, process in place, in case too many funds stepped up, and it diluted the pot of money to the point where there just wasn't really enough significant money to go around. So we had kind of a community prioritization process that we had thought through that we hope that we didn't really need to use, but that we had designed kind of in consultation. with our colleagues.

85
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:43.450
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So in the end 50 of eligible funds stepped back. They said, we're going to step back from this funding round. That meant 23 funds. stepped up for grants, and 100% of the funds received grants from the process.

86
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:50.120
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: and this is what it looks like. So we've actually just moved through a full kind of

87
00:19:50.150 --> 00:20:07.060
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: so these grants our reporting period goes from 8 April to march. So March 2023, was just kind of the end of our fiscal year. So we've now just gone through a full year of moving money into women's funds and kind of working with them and accompanying them in a an approach that we call the grants plus approach.

88
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:23.690
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So what's happened in this kind of funding stream over the past year is that we've moved about 15 million dollars in actual funds and and commitments to future funds, because this is multi year funding. Once you step up for funds, it includes a funding stream for multiple years.

89
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:40.980
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So about 14 million dollars has been committed in multi year. Flexible Grants Women's Fund can use the majority of the money for on granting, but they can also use a pot of the money for organizational development or paying for salaries or paying to keep the lights on.

90
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:55.850
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So it's core flexible funding. The majority of the funds are national funds. 2 of the funds are what we call rapid response. Women's funds who who work exclusively in kind of the emergency response and humanitarian space.

91
00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:05.939
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: 5 funds focused specifically on marginalized communities. And 30% of the funds are what we call emerging funds, which are 5 years or or younger.

92
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:23.019
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So I'm gonna stop there. I kind of started this this talk by saying, You know, in the Equality Fund, we think about innovation as kind of permission to reimagine the world. So I'm I'm kind of excited to hear from this group around

93
00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:30.900
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: what everybody is reimagining around Web 3. And and what's becoming possible with new technology and new partnerships.

94
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:36.739
Michelle Baldwin (she/her): So, Michelle, I think I'll stop there. Is that okay for sure? Thank you.

95
00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:43.140
Michelle Baldwin (she/her): Well, maybe I'll just yeah. I I have lots of things going through my mind. But

96
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:54.199
Michelle Baldwin (she/her): I would love to. Yeah here, if people, if you're having any beautiful radical questions, coming up for you, or yeah, just thoughts on

97
00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:01.499
Michelle Baldwin (she/her): what was shared. and I know I appreciate it because you hear about this. But

98
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:06.459
Michelle Baldwin (she/her): seeing the models and the concepts of what you're working from are super helpful.

99
00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:15.060
Rowan Yeoman: So just just one question for me. So on the on the last piece. which is super interesting. By the way, how

100
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:19.200
Rowan Yeoman: how are you thinking about managing the or or

101
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:26.860
Rowan Yeoman: gaining confidence that the system will produce the kind of quality of

102
00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.589
Rowan Yeoman: funds in order to be able to receive the money

103
00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:47.070
Rowan Yeoman: as in it as you scale. And and it's less hands on. And people go. Yeah, we want to step forward. what's the mechanism there? Because that's sort of the big thorny issue, isn't it? We? It's come through a thousand hoops because the fund that doesn't want to take the risk of the money will not be used. Well.

104
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:52.940
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: yeah, I think there are. So when we think of like a dow or a disco structure.

105
00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:58.640
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: if we're thinking about kind of the next iteration, right? Because what I think I start out by saying

106
00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.010
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: that the participatory approaches that we're using

107
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:22.959
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: in theory are going to fail as the system gets larger and larger, right as proximity like. So the the catalyzed funding stream where we're moving money directly to women's organizations around the world. That's we use a global advisory panel from that. So feminist activists from different regions and different language profiles are the ones that are making decisions.

108
00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:34.199
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: The the activate funding stream is where we fund other women's funds so that they can have a larger grant making portfolio, because, of course, there's tons of money in the world for capacity. Building

109
00:23:34.680 --> 00:24:00.610
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: donors love to build capacity. But the way that a great, like a women's fund or a funding organization builds capacity is by growing your grant, making portfolio because you get good at grant making when you grant, make more money, and when you, when you're faced with all these bizarre situations about, how do you move money into this country? And what about this exception that this grantee partner wants to the funding agreement? Things like that? Right? So our fund for women's funds.

110
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:05.309
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: About 70 of the money that moves out to women's funds is on granted.

111
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:22.160
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: And so we were working in the step up step back process with an ecosystem that we were appear of. That was a fairly mature ecosystem. And so the question for us is, is that replicable at a larger scale when there aren't the

112
00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:41.409
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: the, the, the ties across organizations, right? And relationships. There are also a lot of small P politics, though, like in the women's, the regions of, like the global funds and the regional funds, and all of this kind of stuff. So I mean, there are positive and negatives about working with an intact ecosystem.

113
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:58.630
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: But, Rowan, I think a lot of I mean, the program officers of the Equality Fund, primarily based in the global north do have to do due diligence. I mean, we fall under the Canadian taxing and revenue system and legal system. So there is a certain amount of due diligence that we have to move through.

114
00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:14.159
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: And it's not only due diligence from the legal perspective, but also due diligence about the types of organizations that we fund right. We tend to fund self led organizations, organizations that are led by the people who they serve and support in their communities.

115
00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.540
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So I I mean.

116
00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:21.510
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: it would be a lot more efficient if these organizations had

117
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:34.910
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: had due diligence done by their peers in the community, who are a lot closer to them rather than Canadians sitting in Ottawa, Canada, who are thousands of miles away from women's organizations, you know, around the world.

118
00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:50.770
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So I I think the idea is that the Disco that we're thinking of like the distributed cooperative organization, the cells would be self forming, you know, small community of women's organizations that are in small trusted relationships with each other.

119
00:25:50.930 --> 00:26:04.209
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: and you know they would come together and decide. Okay, like, are any of us putting? You know, there's a new round of funding that's moving through the Disco. Are any of us putting ourselves forward for a funding opportunity? And what might that look like?

120
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:07.939
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: But I think we haven't cracked the code, Roland, like

121
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.310
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: I think it's hard like. The last time you and I talked I was talking about like, how do we move

122
00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:32.259
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: intelligence through the Disco, so that the members of the of the Disco can see what the needs are across the community and they can absorb what's happening around the community. And and what we're thinking of is like uploading data into some sort of beautiful feminist

123
00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:49.010
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: AI or algorithm that will then take all of this data and then provide us with, you know, an optimal grant making portfolio that includes geographic diversity. And you know that out that ensures that funds are being allocated to marginalized groups and things like that.

124
00:26:49.140 --> 00:27:08.989
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So I think what we're we're envisioning, which might be a terrible idea. But we're got to start somewhere in terms of experiments is that we would have women's organizations. probably maybe in regions go through a round of, you know, of filtering a little bit, if that makes sense, or inside of cells

125
00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:12.290
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: go through a little bit of a round of filters in some way.

126
00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:33.059
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: But then what we'd like to do is just we'd like to launch learning days and say, if you're interested in learning more about the work of women's funds working on this thematic area or in this region. Then, you know, join this learning day, and you're going to have a chance to hear from 4 or 5 or 6 women's organizations that are working on gender equality.

127
00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:53.649
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: And you know, we want you to to rate them based on, you know, I don't know 5 or 6 different criteria that we're looking at. and you know those criteria would be uploaded, and then we would take a look at, you know, which women's organization seem to be resonating in terms of the data that's getting uploaded.

128
00:27:53.660 --> 00:28:04.629
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: And how does that also sync up with, you know, regional equality. And you know, feedback that's coming up, perhaps from the different regions that are out there in the world local context.

129
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.350
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So I don't know, Rowan, like I think it can be done.

130
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:26.419
Michelle Baldwin (she/her): But I don't I? We're we're not sure how yet, but we're kind of ready to to kind of think about it. I might have answered your question. I'm sorry. I feel like I rambled on there. Yeah, no, that. That was a much better answer than the question that I asked. And Jokey has a couple of questions as well.

131
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:28.849
Michelle Baldwin (she/her): which awesome hi and jokey.

132
00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:35.550
Njoki Mbũrũ (she|her): Hi, Sue! thank you for for sharing that. That was

133
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:42.209
Njoki Mbũrũ (she|her): to learn about the work, re imagining work that you've been doing at High Quality Fund.

134
00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:50.849
Njoki Mbũrũ (she|her): one question just came up because of what you answer right now. So I'll change my other questions and ask this one

135
00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:56.229
Njoki Mbũrũ (she|her):  When we think, when, when, as you were talking about how

136
00:28:56.450 --> 00:29:00.230
Njoki Mbũrũ (she|her): you know, sister organizations in a certain context, would

137
00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:07.440
Njoki Mbũrũ (she|her): talk amongst each other and decide, okay, which one of us, or which one which ones among us would be stepping up.

138
00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:17.489
Njoki Mbũrũ (she|her): What came to my mind was, what is the risk of rep reproducing competition then, in that scenario where they're not competing to receive funds from

139
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:23.139
Njoki Mbũrũ (she|her): you? But there now is a it seems, like another layer of competition that's

140
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:27.489
Njoki Mbũrũ (she|her): introduce amongst them that in a sense feels like

141
00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:37.679
Njoki Mbũrũ (she|her): an Olympics of of their, you know, to show that they are the most need needy for for the funding. And I wonder what kind of conversations you're having about

142
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.109
Njoki Mbũrũ (she|her): the risk of that?

143
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:56.340
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: Yeah, I think there's massive risk because it it. There's a risk of reinforcing power dynamics right inside of regions. so you know, I'm not sure that we really have it right. Maybe it's less around a step up, step back process.

144
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:59.930
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: Maybe it's more around

145
00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.870
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: endorsements

146
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:11.290
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: that you know. Because I think what, what, what, what part of the risk of scaling is that.

147
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:18.950
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: you know, like there's lots of organizations that come to the Equality Fund for money. But

148
00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:26.399
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: you know I'll give you an example. There was, you know, we received an amazing proposal one year from an organization

149
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:41.150
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: that was doing some great work with sex workers. And we do a lot of funding for sex workers because they don't. They're not eligible for funding from lots of different donors. But this was from kind of an academic organization.

150
00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:51.620
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: It was not from an organization that was led by sex workers themselves. And so, even though the work that they were doing sounded great.

151
00:30:51.970 --> 00:31:03.860
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: we did not fund them because they just did not fit. The profile of what we felt was  you know, was an organization led by the community and

152
00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:12.330
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: the key language around that for us is when any application refers to someone or a woman as a beneficiary.

153
00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:29.599
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: As soon as an organization starts referring to someone as a beneficiary. We know that they're not really led by their constituents. They are led by them, and they think of women, as you know, they're led by us, and they think of women as them.

154
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.810
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: If that makes sense like

155
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:39.730
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: I don't. I don't want anyone to consider me kind of a beneficiary right? It's it's just like shifting power and power dynamics.

156
00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:46.269
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So I think there is. There is a lot of value in the Disco and in the cell model of

157
00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:52.800
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: helping us ensure that the types of organizations that are putting themselves forward

158
00:31:53.010 --> 00:32:06.050
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: are are have been filtered by peers in the feminist ecosystem. To say, Yeah, like this is a legit organization doing amazing work led by the constituents in the communities. And these people deserve funding.

159
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.710
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: Right? So

160
00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:20.110
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: I think there is a role for colleagues in the system to play, in helping to endorse. If that makes sense, that this is the type of organization that the equality fund.

161
00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:32.409
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: you know, we have certain criteria, that kind of unpack, that concept that I've just kind of put into a little bit of a box. But I think there is. There is value that can be generated in the community there, that's much

162
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:39.449
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: closer to, you know, proximate leadership than what we end up doing at the Equality fund from the global north.

Rowan Yeoman: his things scale.

176
00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:36.320
Rowan Yeoman: We feel the need to constrain the more because we have less ability to sort of deal with complexity. And so we constraining the training and strain. And then we just end up with this really constrained system that doesn't have nuance and doesn't deal with complexity. And yeah, yeah, it's all I think this is, this is awesome. It's the it's the stuff to be wrestling with.

177
00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:47.150
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: Yeah. And I think like I think we spend a lot of time wrestling with the formulas, the dynamics, the you know.

178
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:58.649
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: the governance. But I think what we've learned is that this, the community and the values are just as important as the underlying mechanisms.

179
00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:11.039
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: Right? Like, we spend tons of time just designing the step up, step back process with other women's funds right like, how do you design the workshops? How do you engage with them? What sort of conversations are happening? How are you weaving?

180
00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:24.840
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: You know, relationships? And how are you? You know, orienting yourself to this community in a way that's, you know, respectful and generative. So I think part of us are trying to figure out like as we scale as we think about scaling grant, making

181
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:42.889
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: around the world, using kind of a Disco and a web? 3. Architecture. How do we really ensure that it that we hold And we build culture in really intentional ways? Because I think it's the culture around decision making and the culture and values around community building

182
00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:52.729
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: that can actually bring people together from around the world who don't know each other, or who aren't, geographically or linguistically, you know, linked together.

183
00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:57.930
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So we're actually spending quite a bit of time trying to think about, how do you build community and culture

184
00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:20.929
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: digitally right. And I think, the cell model. And Rowan you, you have a better sense of how this works in terms of replication and like numbers, right? And when you get past certain certain scales. But I guess what we're trying to think about is, how do we really build trust at a small scale that allows for trust to kind of flow across a disco in a way that

185
00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:28.229
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: maintains the cultures and values that are really important to the feminist funding ecosystem

186
00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:40.980
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund:  and that are then reflective of how decisions get made. If that makes sense instead of the other way around, like, how do we spend our time figuring out how decisions get made? And then.

187
00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:46.929
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: you know, the culture and the community and the values basically orient themselves to like a decision making governance model.

188
00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.370
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: Yeah, I I love it. It's kind of chicken and egg, right?

189
00:36:53.230 --> 00:37:02.830
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So I think we're pretty good at community and values. But we have no idea like how to build algorithms or like, we're also super curious, like, part of

190
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:07.159
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: like, let's say, each each women's organization puts together.

191
00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:17.010
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: you know a 3 min video, you know. And we when we have learning days, they play the video. Everybody plays a 3 min video giving a certain amount of information that they're required to give.

192
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:28.029
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: and then they're available to answer questions, let's say, for 15 or 20 min of of from the people who are joining in in that learning day. And who are, you know, assessing each organization?

193
00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:40.709
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund:  like, how could we like organizations that are sophisticated with videos, will automatically have an advantage, right? Because they're putting together a great model.

194
00:37:40.850 --> 00:38:00.979
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So is there a way that we could use AI in a way that women's organizations have a more even playing field in designing their, you know, in flowing information through the Disco, so that you know that is also a power dynamic that is not influencing, you know, decision making around the Disco

195
00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:21.650
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: a lot of. And yeah, I'm just hold myself back from roofing on any of these things. And like, we're we're even thinking, too, like, you know, what kind of artwork do we want to generate inside of the disco that everybody can have access to? So that when you're putting together, you know, when you're using the AI system to put together your pitch deck.

196
00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:41.959
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: then you know, everybody has access to the same type of you know, artwork, and maybe the deal is, if you're using artwork in your pitch deck, then that becomes, you know, part of the creative Commons of the Disco with, you know, obviously with with appreciation, for where it came from or so I I don't know. I just think there's

197
00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:49.030
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: like, we're always trying to think about like, what is the value proposition of the Disco over and above the winners and losers of Grant making

198
00:38:49.950 --> 00:39:03.129
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: well, like having access to an incredible, you know, bank of feminist artwork awesome, having access to an algorithm that can help you build out applications and pitch decks and decks for donors and all of that kind of stuff.

199
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:19.179
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: Amazing learning about like. let's say that there was a learning day on Lgbtq organizations, right? And what they're doing around the world for this round of funding. Well, you know, linking into a learning day to see what's going on with your peers working in a similar space from you.

200
00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:32.049
213
00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:23.070
Njoki Mbũrũ (she|her): decision making with the changing needs that are there. As we see the world

214
00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.599
Njoki Mbũrũ (she|her): rapidly changing. So that was just a thought.

215
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:28.759
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: yeah, and we're thinking,

216
00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:57.909
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: like, when we start to really get excited at the Equality Fund, like, we're thinking of 3 value streams in the Disco, a love value stream, a care value stream and a livelihoods value stream. So let's say that we're moving 10 million dollars through the Disco in grants for the year, a percentage of that would be allocated to the care value stream to compensate people who are caring for the disco right, like the governance, the values, the onboarding, the exiting like.

217
00:41:57.910 --> 00:42:14.180
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: It's a huge amount of work caring for a disco right that should be compensated. And quite frankly, if I was logging, you know, care credits into the Disco as a member of the Equality Fund, I would then, just like the Equality Fund would

218
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:24.870
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: would donate those credits back into the Disco because I'm compensated by the Equality Fund to do this job. But there are many women's organizations that are, you know that don't have

219
00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:31.169
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: the privilege of you know the salaries, or you know the support from an organization to be a part of this.

220
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:43.919
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So part of what we're thinking of is like. Not only is there the livelihood stream that's moving money through the Disco through grants, but there's the care stream that is taking a portion of the grants to kind of care for the Disco

221
00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:56.430
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: to take a look at the algorithm. Is it working properly to check in with people who didn't, who didn't win. You know. How did that go? All of that stuff? And then there's the love value stream, which is kind of an exchange of value like

222
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:59.610
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: let's say that you needed a document translated.

223
00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:17.760
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: you know, into a language, and you know you're looking for English, and I'm looking for Spanish. Well, like, let's do an exchange of value between the 2 of us. Right like you can post requests into the Disco. And again, people can earn kind of credits in the Disco or exchange services in the Disco.

224
00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:32.189
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: or you could just upload lessons, learned documents, or, for Heaven's sakes, the Equality Fund. In 3 years. I don't know how many policies we've had to write for international donors. Right? We have a sexual exploitation and abuse policy. We've got an investment policy we've got.

225
00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:40.549
238
00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:35.979
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: I mean, I think the I think the long term value proposition of this for us is that it means that funds don't necessarily have to flow through the Equality fund.

239
00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:39.399
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: Donors can drop money into the Disco directly.

240
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:51.169
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: So so I think. like when I envision what this could be in 10 years, right? Like when we're really reimagining in 10 years. This could be

241
00:45:51.680 --> 00:46:02.089
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: where donors put their money into the feminist funding ecosystem, because we have proven that women's organizations can allocate funds amongst themselves.

242
00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:03.929
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: and quite frankly.

243
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:11.390
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: that would also involve a decentralized financial infrastructure right that could move money through the Disco

244
00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:24.140
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: in some way, shape or form. So I think, Michelle. you know, we're at this point where we have some deep understanding of community and culture experimentation around participatory grant making.

245
00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:34.770
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: We have this kind of crazy vision for the next, maybe 2 or 3 years, and then there's like the 10 year. What's becoming possible? Right if we can get the shorter term things working out.

246
00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:40.049
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: But it's taking the next step, I think, into the technology side of things.

247
00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:57.069
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: That is a little bit of a struggle like like, I think that's what part of this partnership is. Right like. Is there a group of us that want to experiment with AI. And how do we use AI to generate information and knowledge and flow it through a disco in ways that are

248
00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:12.330
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: You know that that that live into kind of the quality and power dynamics and things like that. is there a region that we're coming up to with the quality fund or a specific grant making round that we want to identify as a potential experiment?

249
00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:26.190
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: Or do we want to run maybe like an AV process where we're doing our participatory process that everybody knows works. But then we're also in parallel running a process that's not going to end up with money, but

250
00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:37.920
263
00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:53.750
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: you know, hold on to kind of the the values that are driving the why behind this, and then find allies that are are intersecting with us in similar areas. But maybe in totally different ways.

264
00:49:53.870 --> 00:50:01.740
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: and say, Hey, like, if you're thinking about AI, and we're thinking about AI, let's do a little bit of work over here, and maybe we can do some work over here and

265
00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:09.150
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: and kind of see where that takes us. But I feel like at the Equality Fund. I need to start proving to people that this is possible. Now.

266
00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.699
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: like, I can talk a good game on this.

267
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:35.230
Michelle Baldwin (she/her): But I need to start putting things like I need to start making a tangible if that makes sense. Well, maybe that's a good, maybe, Rowan, I I do have to bounce up so a little after 5 here. But yeah, okay, because I noticed you. You have. I want some radical love? But, Rowan, yeah, what was your burning question? Do you have one to?

268
00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:43.800
Michelle Baldwin (she/her): I'm going to start rambling on one. Okay? And there's one of the 3 min. Okay, 3 min.

269
00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:58.180
Michelle Baldwin (she/her): Okay, okay, we actually only have 1 min. So in all fairness to them, okay, well, huge. Thanks. I think it would be fun. Yeah, to have a further conversation about yeah, what what's next? And

270
00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:20.570
Michelle Baldwin (she/her): But I yeah, I love this, and I'm glad we recorded it, and I'll share it with the the folks who asked. I felt like they missed it. And then let's figure out how to get you into super benefits so that people can ask you questions there in case there's something else that comes up after. So

271
00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:38.910
Michelle Baldwin (she/her): okay, for sure, I think next step for me, Michelle is figuring out where the intersections of some of the ideas I've put forward, and some of the needs, and the other colleagues that are working on this, because I have 2 other colleagues who

272
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:52.360
Sue (she/her) Equality Fund: are in this with me, but I haven't brought them in here yet, because I just feel like I'm trying to figure out where some of the the cells or pods might be going with experiments or ideas. And then between the 3 of us, we can kind of allocate our time, of course.

273
00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.190
Michelle Baldwin (she/her): Okay.

274
00:51:53.260 --> 00:52:02.740
Michelle Baldwin (she/her): sounds cool. Okay, beautiful. Thank you. Everyone

275
00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:04.320
