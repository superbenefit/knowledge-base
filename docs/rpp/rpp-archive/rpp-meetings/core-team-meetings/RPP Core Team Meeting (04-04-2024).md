# Updates

- Women Win conversation was a big hit. Recording will be available. Potential partner followups incoming. 

- Open Civics - discussed whether it would be AIFS or RPP applying. We need Shanny to help us shape up what the project could look like before we can determine how to proceed. Michelle is connecting with Shanny - Shanny will work on application.

- Rather is having a call with The Ready next Thursday. Let Rather know if you have any questions to pass on.

- Network Sovereignties Open Call with you. This research residency program (re-)imagines community governance for a networked age. From May until September, we bring together 5-10 governance visionaries in online and offline formats including a one-month stay at our studio on Lake Ammersee, Germany. The program requires no full-time commitment.
