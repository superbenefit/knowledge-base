	- Onboarding - what can we learn from? what are the next steps? (Heenal)
		- WREEP
			- stewardship group is equivalent of stakeholder group in RPP
			- stakeholder group = reps of retrofit communities, in the durham region (utility companies, HOAs, etc)
			- wider community
			- current focus = onboarding stakeholder group. most of them don't know web3 so figuring out a simple way of doing that. building in safety valves so that people can use email and zoom. 
			- key question: "what's the proposition for people to participate in something?" - rather than "building a community"/gathering people
			- 3 meanings of "stewardship"
				- web2 def - mgmt 
				- web3 def - elected or appointed roles in charge in functions
				- bioregional (traditional) definition
		- onboarding
			- for a cell it's a tactical thing - something than needs to get done - but with SB it's part of its raison d'etre - it's purpose-driven - so needs to be done with care
			- make it an operational function rather than an admin function
			- more structure, procedural approach
			- 
- ## Longer items:
	- (Rowan) Do a walkthrough of the Charmverse set up so we can start managing tasks in Charmverse. Plan for migration - e.g moving cell state to charmverse
