# Agenda

Discuss shorter agenda items:

- Social Impact Paper - next steps

- Stakeholder meeting update 

- Catalyst Community Finance Summit (May 28-30)- flipping power session - any input? (MB)

  - prep call Mon May 6 - planning on how to approach session

  - Questions - Collectively exploring the question, “How do we harness community knowledge into social finance?” How do we treat community knowledge with respect in the fund design? How does design inform ownership? How do we operationalize and ensure capacity to engage in a good way?

- Check in on timing phase one - May 16 as target for some good progress (MB)

- Partnership Tracking

  - 

## Longer items

Discuss longer agenda items:

- Discuss the idea of funding a collaboration with open civics to work on the pattern library (Rowan)

- Cobudgeting Retrospective (rather)

  - What was great about our Cobudgeting experience?

    - Transparency - Makes us think about the clarity of our communication

    - App works well; Intuitive

    - Funding outcome was copacetic

    - Novel experience; Thinking in a new way

    - Opportunity for retrospective

    - Provides information to outsiders / transparency

    - Budget breakdown is helpful when making decisions on how to value things

  - What was bad about our Cobudgeting experience?

    - Transparency - Social dynamics of public allocations may be problematic. / Pressure to please everyone

    - Can't reassign funds after allocating

    - Not a good use of time / Takes too long

    - Estimating costs is difficult; Outcomes are vague

    - Workflows are repetitive / Double-entry is a pain

    - Inefficient vs having a conversation within the team

    - Not ideal for small-scale teams vs larger ones

  - Should we use Cobudget again? If so, what should change?

    - Might prefer exploring alternatives like coordinape

    - Having more experience with various tools would be good.

    - Might be interested in using this for a different type of allocation

    - A more deliberative approach would be better for ws budget

## Action items

- [ ] 

## Decision log

- Decided to push the strategy conversation to next week when we will have hopefully made enough progress on workstreams to plan next steps

- Consent check - everyone consented to rather pushing ahead with a conversation with Open Civics and the possibility of committing 1ETH to the collaboration with them

# Reflection

> **How have we approached reimagining power in this meeting?**

- Experimenting with new ways of doing things; not going with the default approach

- Examining how we approach pacing and deadlines

- Collaborating outside of our team on aligned missions
