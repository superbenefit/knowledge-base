# Reflection 

> **How have we approached reimagining power in this meeting?**

-  Reflecting on how people can move in and out of the OS stewards role in a way that doesn't hold power in individuals in ways that don't serve the project 

- We can always dig deeper and get more context to really understand the dynamics at play. Not just taking the surface level analysis.
