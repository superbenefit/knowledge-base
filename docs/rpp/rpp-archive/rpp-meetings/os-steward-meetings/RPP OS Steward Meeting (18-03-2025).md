Minutes📝 OS Stewards Weekly Meeting Notes 🕞 Started at 2:06PM on 18 Mar, lasted 2h 40mPlaybook Development and Knowledge CommonsThe team is developing a playbook while contributing to a broader knowledge commons initiative.A knowledge garden system is being used to organize and share information, with content backed up to Arweave for permanence.Rather is updating the knowledge garden infrastructure and cleaning up old content in preparation for new playbook material.Rowan has been working on DAO primitives, patterns, and templates, including implementation guides for community, operational, and multi-stakeholder governance.There is a draft playbook content outline, but there is uncertainty about what should be included and how to provide input. It was clarified that it is meant as a starting point for iteration.Plans are in place to collaborate more closely on refining the playbook structure and content, potentially involving the broader team for feedback.The goal is to create a playbook that informs people on key topics and includes case studies of their work. A budget of $4000 has been allocated for this effort.Coordination with other groups like Open Civics is ongoing to enable sharing and discovery of information across communities through backend knowledge commons infrastructure.Funding the Commons Conference RecapRather attended the Funding the Commons conference and shared insights from the event.The event brought together diverse groups including Web3 builders, academics, funders, and organizations like the Internet Archive.There was a strong focus on using knowledge and technology to address existential threats to humanity.The Internet Archive's physical setup, with servers in a former church, created a powerful atmosphere blending technology and reverence for knowledge.Participants workshopped ideas for building tools to nudge AI development in beneficial directions.Discussions were held about public product organizations and ways to fund critical open source infrastructure.The event highlighted the potential for collaboration between different ideological groups who share some common goals.Web3 and DeFi DevelopmentsRecent developments in Web3 and decentralized finance were discussed by the group.Coinbase put their stock on-chain, creating arbitrage opportunities between on-chain and traditional markets.New projects are exploring credit-based lending in crypto, using both on-chain and traditional credit score data.Developments in under-collateralized lending are emerging, supported by risk management markets.Services like Earnifi are providing payday loan-style services using smart contracts and yield farming to offer instant cash advances against pending paychecks.These DeFi innovations aim to provide more transparent, efficient, and accessible financial services compared to traditional systems.
