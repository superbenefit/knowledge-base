  - There's a need to get colleagues at EF and Women Win on-board

  - We could get on a call with Bryan and have him walk us through the hypothetical onboarding of EF and make a doc to share with Sue and team

  - Rather will share cal link with heenal + heenal ask rowan's availability -> pick a time for a call with Bryan

- IRL QF (heenal)

  - quadratic busking idea. what would be a MVP? scope it out with Liam. connect with folks with Open Civics, Gitcoin, Giveth, round operators, etc

  - even if QF not possible, could do quadratic voting (do the math manually)

- ICS Experiment - Is [discovery report ok](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/wip-ics-discovery-report-29166163934225553)? if so, let's start scoping (heenal)

  - rather will review and suggest/comment

  - heenal start scoping

  - Cells for repair cafe, etc, nodes, etc

    - State doc/repo for entities

    - Utilities for transparency

      - on-chain transparency is simple (ICS could even be a SB project and share accounting infrastructure). off-chain is trickier - it's pretty manual. look at Open Collective as a possibility (making payments through their platform) - could help clarify relationship between ICS and Repair Cafe. 

      - Open Collective is splitting and half is moving on-chain! rather knows some folks there and maybe ICS could be an alpha tester

- Create an overview of the governance primitives/tools to go in the knowledge (from discussion at GC meeting yesterday)

  - 

- Discuss where to go with the [RPP planning going forward](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/develop-ideas-for-rpp-future-opportunities-rpp-core-team-6168880145642328) - beyond the initial doc (rowan)

  - What are folks (individually and collectively) interested in doing?

  - What fulfills the mission / intention of rpp

  - What is valuable to stakeholders?

  - What are the synergies between these?

- Discuss feedback on AIFS compensation (rather)

- Discuss possible use of / partnership with the wellbeing protocol (rowan)

- Windfall Protocol collab around null fund, ai agents, etc.

# Summary

- Heenal and rather discussed setting up a call with Brian from Newton to discuss onboarding the Equality Fund for crypto payments.

- They discussed the idea of running a local quadratic funding experiment, potentially collaborating with Gitcoin on this.

- Heenal shared the discovery report for the ICS experiment and they discussed next steps for organizational structuring and transparency.

- They discussed the need for an overview of governance primitives and tools to be added to the knowledge base.

- rather shared an update on the potential collaboration between Windfall protocols and the Reimagining Power project.

- They discussed compensation concerns raised by Jose regarding the perceived disparity with Colleen's compensation.

- Heenal and rather explored the possibility of attending ETHDenver and GFL events to represent Super Benefit and build relationships.

- Heenal mentioned an upcoming panel discussion on "Greenfill London: Leveraging Emerging Tech for Local Impact" where he planned to discuss the local node idea and social impact initiatives.

MinutesSummary of Previous CallRather summarized a previous call, noting potential synergy between windfall protocols and fundraising direction for the Reimagining Power project.They discussed the possibility of joining forces in the fundraising realm while maintaining individual focus areas.The idea involves using aspects of DeFi from various sources to create an elegant solution that addresses problems without adding complexity.Rather highlighted the potential to explore the intersection of AI, Web3, and social impact investing, using Brian's case as an example of investors seeking intermediaries with subject matter expertise.Proposed Investment ModelRather outlined a proposed investment model where investors could join a single fund with high yields (over 10% base yield, potentially higher with rehypothecation).The system would allow investors to rehypothecate into various sub-funds and receive impact attestations to prove the impact generated without taking equity or creating coercive dynamics.This approach aims to provide both financial returns and verifiable impact, solving multiple problems simultaneously.The system would use AI or facilitators to help investors choose opportunities based on their impact preferences and requirements, analyzing funding streams, qualities, and relationships to find the best placement for their money.Advantages of the Proposed ModelThe proposed model offers several advantages: It provides better yields than traditional impact investing, offers improved proof of impact through on-chain provenance (similar to Microsoft's use of the 2CAN protocol for carbon credits), and eliminates the need for equity transfer or complex management structures.This approach creates a win-win situation where investors get better returns and impact verification without subordinating relationships between parties.Further Development CommitmentsRather committed to further developing the concept by whiteboarding the idea in detail.They will discuss with subject matter experts in various areas to assess feasibility.They plan to contact the team running the Noll Fund and potential builders who could assist.They are exploring collaboration with Bread Chain's development team, who are working on implementing the Noll Fund.They aim to identify actual opportunities and relationships to accelerate collaboration.They will create a whiteboard presentation that makes sense to all stakeholders.Onboarding Equality FundHeenal and Rather discussed setting up a call with Brian to explore onboarding the Equality Fund to use cryptocurrency.They decided to approach this in stages: Have an initial call with Newton (Brian) to discuss the hypothetical situation and document the onboarding process.They will prepare a practice document for onboarding.They will use this information to prepare the client (Equality Fund).They will facilitate the actual connection between the parties.They emphasized the importance of handling the situation delicately, focusing on building relationships and buy-in before diving into technical details.Cautious Approach with CryptocurrencyRather advised being cautious about mentioning cryptocurrency explicitly when dealing with traditional financial institutions and philanthropic organizations.They suggested framing the transactions as sending funds to a project partner through an intermediary, without specifically mentioning crypto.They assured that the tools they use allow for selective decryption of transaction information for auditing purposes, maintaining compliance while preserving privacy.Governance Primitives OverviewRather and Heenal briefly discussed creating an overview of governance primitives and tools for the knowledge base.They suggested starting with mapping the territory using their established categories (community governance, stakeholder governance, operational governance) and then refining and contextualizing this information for the Reimagining Power Project (RPP).They planned to collaborate with Rowan on this task when he becomes available.High-Level Visioning SessionHeenal expressed the need for a high-level visioning session to organize and prioritize the numerous ideas and projects on their agenda.They proposed considering multiple factors in decision-making, including individual team members' interests and goals, collective impact potential, alignment with the original Remaking Power project vision, and value to stakeholders and partners.Rather suggested creating an asynchronous document where team members can contribute their thoughts and ideas, followed by a collaborative sense-making session to identify patterns and priorities.Compensation Disparities ConcernRather brought up a concern raised by Jose regarding compensation disparities within the team.They discussed the challenges of onboarding new team members, especially with language barriers, and the difficulty in quantifying the value of certain contributions.They proposed solutions including providing Jose with more concrete tasks, such as Discord administration, helping him better document his contributions, and potentially increasing his compensation if justified by additional responsibilities.Heenal agreed this was an important conversation to have early in the project's development.Attendance at ETH Denver and GFLHeenal and Rather discussed their potential attendance at ETH Denver and General Forum on Ethereum Localism.Heenal confirmed their plans to attend, while Rather expressed interest but noted budget constraints.They explored possibilities for securing funding for travel and accommodation, including reaching out to contacts for couch-surfing opportunities and potentially submitting a proposal to the core team for travel compensation.They agreed that attending in person would be valuable for building relationships, catalyzing energy, and representing Super Benefit.Upcoming Local Event ParticipationHeenal informed Rather about an upcoming local event called the General Forum on Arts Localis, where they and Michelle will participate in a panel titled 'Greenfll London: Leveraging Emerging Tech for Local Impact.'The panel will discuss using technology for local impact, including the local node idea and social impact initiatives.Heenal planned to sketch out ideas for a quadratic funding MVP experiment with Liam at the event.They briefly discussed the potential of recording or streaming the event, though details were not finalized.
