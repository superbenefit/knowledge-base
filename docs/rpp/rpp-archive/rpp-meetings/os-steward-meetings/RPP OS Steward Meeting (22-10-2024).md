MinutesOpen Civics Gatherings ProgramThe Open Civics gatherings program was mentioned as a potential opportunity for collaboration or sponsorship to bring together people focused on relevant memes and merge networks.Storytelling Assistance by Christina Barrow LucidChristina (BarrowLucid), a storytelling expert, is available to help with storytelling across the Reimagining Power Project (RPP) and All in for Sport.The team plans to schedule a call with relevant people to determine how they can best assist.Gathering Steward RoleThe Gathering Steward role, which is currently vacant, was discussed.The Community Experience cell could wear the Gathering Steward hat, acting as the connection between the Reimagining Power Project and the Community Experience cell.This approach helps to unify the messy bits by providing clear authority and responsibility.OTF Briefing FeedbackThe team reviewed the OTF (Ontario Trillium Foundation) briefing feedback.Rowan had made edits to flesh out governance developments and other aspects.Simplifying the 'Additional Future Activities' section was considered to make it more understandable for Tracy at OTF.Focusing on how the project will mobilize, distribute, and affect capital flows aligns with OTF's interests in systems finance and blended catalytic capital.Playbooks Discovery Retro PlanningPreparation for the Playbooks Discovery Retro Planning was discussed.Rowan has created an operational plan for the Playbooks project, which can be used to create a meeting agenda for the retrospective and sense-making session.Knowledge Garden PotentialThe Knowledge Garden was highlighted as a valuable tool for onboarding new team members and collaborators.It serves as a centralized location for project information, terminology, and concepts.The structure of the Knowledge Garden includes folders like RPP (Reimagining Power Project) and the artifacts folder.Emphasis was placed on the flexibility of the system and the ease of adding new content without worrying too much about precise categorization.AI, particularly ChatGPT, was discussed as a helpful tool in creating and managing the Knowledge Garden.ChatGPT is particularly reliable for tasks related to programming and using Git.Using AI to create initial definitions and explanations for the lexicon allows rapid expansion of the knowledge base while maintaining human oversight and nuance.Broader implications include the potential for creating interconnected knowledge bases across different communities or bioregions.A future was envisioned where AI analyzes these knowledge bases to provide insights and recommendations based on real human knowledge rather than AI-generated guesses.The importance of human sense-making and consensus-building was emphasized, with AI seen as a tool to assist and augment these processes rather than replace them.Excitement was expressed about the possibilities of the Knowledge Garden and AI integration, seeing it as a powerful tool for collective sense-making, shared understanding, and leveraging collective knowledge.The potential for this approach to be valuable in various situations and sectors was acknowledged.There was an agreement to continue exploring and developing these ideas, with team members encouraged to reach out for help with Knowledge Garden-related tasks.
