Minutes📝 OS Stewards Weekly Meeting Notes 🕞 Started at 02:02 PM on 15 Oct, lasted 1h 45mGatherings Initiative UpdatesA meeting was held with Love Football, who expressed interest in participating in the gatherings. This was described as good relationship building, though specific collaboration details were not yet determined.A community experience meeting is scheduled for the following day.The gatherings are taking shape, with ongoing discussions about the November timeline. There is a balance between those eager to start and the need for thorough preparation and publicity.The first gathering is planned to be an introduction to Web3 and its connection to impact. This will include a discussion of the Regenerative Protocol Pool (RPP) in general terms.The second gathering will focus on community governance, which aligns with Love Football's interests.The first $10,000 check from Jumpstart for the gatherings has been received. Another $10,000 from OTF is expected within the next week or two.The funds are intended to go into the community experience wallet, which had been set up for this purpose.Session Zero ProposalCreating a 'Session Zero' to precede the gathering series was suggested. This would be similar to the initial stakeholder call done for Windfall, providing an evergreen resource for context.It would include background on All in for Sport, an explanation of how the initiative came together, and introductions to the organizations involved.The team agreed that this was a good idea, with a suggestion that it could be a test run with some 'friendlies' invited, without needing all systems fully implemented.OTF Progress Update DocumentSignificant work was put into tidying up the document, though there is still room for improvement.A meeting with Tracy is scheduled for November 4th at 3 pm Eastern Time.An offer was made to work on making the strategic opportunities section more coherent, focusing on alignment with goals and future plans.The inclusion of AI and Web3 convergence in the document was discussed. It was suggested to frame it as part of the fundamental architecture being discussed, rather than as a separate topic.Approval of Media Manager and Event Facilitator RolesClarification was provided that these roles should be approved by the Community Experience (CX) team rather than the core team, as the CX team is funding the roles.The roles are set to last for the duration of the five gatherings.There was a discussion about the need for a comprehensive budget for all five gatherings, ensuring proper allocation of funds across all roles.Budgeting for GatheringsApproximately $14,500 USD is available for the gatherings.Initial calculations suggested that about $600 per week is available for compensation across roles, assuming a 20-week timeline.Condensing the timeline to 14 weeks was suggested, which would increase the weekly budget to $857, making compensation more attractive.The benefits of a more condensed, higher-intensity schedule were discussed, including better momentum and more efficient use of resources.Structuring the budget per gathering rather than per week was considered, allowing for more flexibility in resource allocation.The possibility of RRP contributing additional funding for content creation and artifacts was discussed.The need to work around the holiday season in scheduling was acknowledged.Update on Gathering Stewards and Community Weaver RolesInterest in being gathering stewards was expressed.Michelle is already in the community weaver role.Jose expressed interest in the community weaver role and mentioned knowing someone else who might be interested.The necessity of having three community weavers, as originally planned, was discussed.Developing Patterns for the Equality FundWorking in parallel to begin developing and documenting patterns for the Equality Fund was suggested.The need to define what these patterns would look like and how they would be presented was discussed.Using the Equality Fund discovery report as a starting point for discussing these patterns was suggested.Setting up a new meeting to process the discovery report and discuss patterns was agreed upon, ensuring all team members have read the report beforehand.Meeting ConclusionTeam members agreed to continue work on various aspects discussed and to reconvene for further planning and discussion.
