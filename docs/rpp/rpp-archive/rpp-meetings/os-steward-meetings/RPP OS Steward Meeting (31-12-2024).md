# Meeting Agenda

Weekly meeting agenda & notes for the RPP Operation & Strategy Stewards team.

## Updates

- No real updated, the community has been mostly unplugged

## Discussion Items

- Equality Fund next steps

  - We will push forward in spite of not having contact with Sue so that we are making progress

  - Get EF exchange account (onramp) set up

    - We need to get them prepared to onramp funds (Heenal has relationships with the Canadian exchange - newton). Reach out to Heenal to see whether he can connect us. Exchange accounts can take a while to set up so getting started soon would be good.

    - We will need to work with EF to get them set up. This will be with EF folks that aren't Sue.

  - Process to drip funds into a self custodied account

    - that can have privacy connected. Possibly arbitrum network (cheaper than mainnet).

    - Set up a secret wallet. Needs to be done using a secure process - e.g using a burner wallet and random times and amounts

    - Using something like railway wallet (for railgun)

    - Possibly use a secret network (ZK) and transfer funds between wallets

    - Practices for privacy payments

      - Burner wallets

      - Shielding funds

      - Unshielding funds

      - ZK transfers

      - Using 2 or more of these practices we can assemble anything we need

    - We'll need some basic documentation

      - Wallets, on/offramping, exchanges, etc

- Boann Exploration

  - Community governance conversations  - overlap between - new forms of capital, growing and sharing knowledge, intelligence in capital allocation. We need a substrate to link these things together. I.e web3/crypto infra.

  - Blockchains can underpin - ai (payments etc), attestations, capital allocation (null fund, quadratic funding etc)

  - SB can look to create the environment within we can create a solution

  - Conversation starter - why are blockchains the appropriate substrate to underpin the meta that we are trying to articulate

  - Perhaps from a community governance playbook, we can land an articulation of the core value proposition of the structures and patterns we are advocating

- 

- Playbook planning (cell & task rollout)
