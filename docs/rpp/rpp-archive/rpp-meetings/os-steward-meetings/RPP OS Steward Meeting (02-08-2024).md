# Meeting Agenda

Weekly meeting agenda & notes for the WREEP web3 core team.

## Updates

- Community Experience held a [meeting](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/community-experience-meeting-15-8-24-08996878571330158) to coordinate a workstream and roles to support gatherings and community mgmt.

  - SB-owned multisig has been deployed for CX

    - Heenal and Michelle are signers; Will add Shanny and Nicole?

    - Can be used to flow resources to community contributors for work and assign authorities (hats)

  - Stakeholder kickoff in early September; Runs through early december?

  - We need to fund this for early work on Gatherings. More funding from OTF coming later.

- Housekeeping: 

  - We need to refill RP Rewards safe.

  - We need to follow up with MoreReese on playbooks

## Discussion Items

- Review key challenge/themes from updated [SI paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fgbs9H3K2f2E40qSgSP42qPsvBBuCqboaTe_nP2TSHQ/edit#heading=h.yfu829dv4rfj). Sense-make around key power dynamics to focus on in RPP

- Update on Playbooks initial funding and expectations

- What is our approach to delegating top-level responsibilities for outputs (gatherings, playbooks, etc) (rather)

- How to handle sponsorships for content

  - Overall/per-piece budget, expectations, rfp?

  - Lead time; Should start soon

- **_Longer Items:_**

**Review of RPP current project activities**  (from [Progress Report](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/rpp-progress-report-4149705692586383))

We need to decide on 

1. Priorities - what work across the current admin workstreams, experiments and deliverables needs to be done and in what order. Also, based on deliverables in the partnership summary doc, what work needs to be done that is currently not in process?

2. Project/task management - how are we are going to do project management/contributor enablement for the above prioritised activities? Developing RFPs/tasks for each project and assigning funding as needed. 

## Progress Report

### Admin Workstreams

Lacks coordination and a clear view of ongoing tasks. It's unclear what tasks are dependencies and which are parallel workstreams. Most tasks are progressing slowly.

- Onboarding: Onboarding flow 95% complete. Onboarding guide in progress. [Onboarding flow](https://www.figma.com/board/ct2DHgl4NjNEyqOadB13ml/Reimagining-Power---Project-Planning?node-id=0-1&t=F1wlUfvM7vs3elrY-1)

  - Onboarding needs have shifted since workstream was formed; SBCX has more capacity now

  - Would be good to re-examine what we need from onboarding and how it relates to other groups/roles

  - Onboarding flow in Figjam has been drafted and reviewed

  - RPP Social Impact and Onboarding Bi-Weekly Working Meetings were combined

  - links to AIFS and SB Community Experience that is spinning up more intentionally

  - MB to check with HR about where at

- Social Impact: The paper is progressing, and the intention is to shift to a shorter summary, as there is an immediate need to integrate core insights into team design conversations for next steps. Partner convening underway.

  - Social impact and onboarding are merged due to overlap and time constraint.

  - Direction for paper has shifted due to re-aligning its needs within the core team / strategy

  - Next steps are to collab on the biweekly call to determine directions and purpose for SI paper moving forward

- Knowledge Stewardship: Main Phase 1 tasks are complete. Some bounties need to be filled, ready for Phase 2. Assistance needed from onboarding to fill bounties.

  - Databases created for the various info types generated in RPP (topics/terms, artifacts, links)

  - No current process for handling tasks and bounties

  - No need for ks workstream to continue within RPP. Contributors can use the KS admin workstream in Charmverse to track related work

- Primitives: Initial framing is complete. Formatting for readability based on core team feedback is needed. More insights from the core team are required to enhance usefulness.

  - Next steps is integrating DAO primitives models with the challenges/power dynamics coming out of the SI workstream and applying these practically into the experiments

  - No need to continue with the DAO Primitives Workstream beyond where its now

### Experiments

- Calgary Parks Impact Attestation Experiment:

  - Defining an impact attestation schema and figuring out an impact scope to organize the attestations (similar to a hypercert).

  - Need to provide the technical design basics and support implementation. The project is waiting for us to provide a one-pager design proposal to the Calgary Parks Foundation.

  - Will be trying to loop Calgary into AIFS gatherings to merge threads

  - Fallback experiment could be network weaving and coordi-nation models

  - This on the back burner with the intention that we'll start working on it in the fall

  - We are involving them in the gatherings in the meantime is a way to gain information about local pain points and current approaches to participatory budgeting. This will hopefully lead to a timeline and design for the larger project

  - Gatherings include following entities:

 AIFS, SB, OTF, JumpStart, Women Win, Ready Sport, Calgary Parks, potentially Krause House

- Equality Fund:

  - Possible scope of experimentation identified. Scoping session scheduling underway

    - Need to identify specific intervention area for experiment and gather info for discovery & scoping

    - Timeline (Fall/Winter) potentially identified

    - Sue has shared info about how their allocation system works

- Institute for Community Sustainability:

  - An alternative experiment (to be discussed) could be to design a DAO-like structure for ICS.

  - Parallel work is underway to develop practical resources for local node experiments to support. This could come out of the playbooks project where practical guidelines establishing a DAO style local node or for federations of local nodes to coordinate across local communities. This could be an easy and impactful direction. 

### Deliverables

- SuperBenefit [Gatherings](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/superbenefit-gatherings-003473329960897331):

  - This initiative aims to weave together network members as part of a community initiative. Partnership with AIFS involves key participants such as Shanny, Nicole, Heenal, and Filsan.

  - ~~Shanny is working on a proposal to the Ontario Trillium Foundation (OTF) with resource planning and proposal feedback from Madam Cult Leader.~~

  - Potential stakeholders in gatherings AIFS, SB, OTF, JumpStart, Women Win, Ready Sport, Calgary Parks, potentially Krause House.

  - [Proposal](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/initial-funding-coordination-for-superbenefit-gatherings-5734408797738995) for initial funding for gatherings and additional gatherings is in progress.

  - Workspace for gatherings is underway to consolidate knowledge around gatherings

    - 

  - This is a good opportunity to decentralise, with AIFS as a major part of this. Perhaps we create a role to be able to give authority to someone to push gatherings forward

  - Include Women win borrel and menses podcast as archived gatherings

- SuperBenefit Playbooks:

  - Feedback from the core team is awaited to proceed. 

  - MoreReese should be paid for the discovery report and a lite strategy for moving forward.

  - Networking with other Playbook creators at OpenCivics to collaborate on outputs, potentially resulting in strategic synergy and resource sharing.

  - Expected outputs include a meta playbook (DAOs and Philanthropy playbook) and other playbooks created in collaboration with OpenCivics.

- Other Media:

  - Exploring opportunities for podcast episodes.

    - Working on podcast interview on the local impact of Network State projects with TBS

    - Potential partnerships with podcasters such as Drew Simon.

  - Need to write RFP for media to inform & reward creators

Report - providing a weekly report to the RPP Core team based on progress

# Meeting Details

Minutes 📝 RPP Stewards Meeting Notes🕞 Started at 03:30 PM on 20 Aug, lasted 29mMeeting OverviewLed by Rowan
Key Points:
Rowan provided an overview of the meeting agenda, which included updates, discussion items, and a broad review of ongoing tasks. He emphasized the need to push forward on several fronts, particularly in sense-making and assigning responsibilities.
Michelle agreed with the agenda and highlighted the importance of aligning on what needs to be moved forward more quickly.
rathermercurial suggested that reviewing the progress report first might help clarify some of the discussion items and align the team’s understanding.Progress and UpdatesDiscussion on Progress Report:
rathermercurial recapped the progress report, explaining that it had been updated a few times but might still contain outdated information. The report covered various workstreams, including administrative work, experiments, and deliverables.
Rowan added that the focus should be on what is missing from the report and what might no longer need prioritization.
rathermercurial mentioned that onboarding and social impact were areas of weakness in the report and called for updates. Michelle then updated the team on the recent decision to combine social impact and onboarding meetings into bi-weekly working sessions.
Rowan stressed the need to assess the ongoing relevance of the onboarding workstream and whether it should continue as is or be integrated into other roles.Workstream EvaluationsSocial Impact Workstream:
Filsan reported that the social impact paper was progressing and that feedback would be reviewed for further discussion. She mentioned that the bi-weekly meetings would focus on next steps beyond the paper, but no concrete plans were in place yet.
Michelle questioned whether the social impact workstream would continue beyond the paper or if it was initially created solely for that purpose. Rowan suggested evaluating the workstream’s future role and whether it should be restructured.Knowledge Stewardship:
rathermercurial provided an update on knowledge stewardship, mentioning that while they had been leading the effort, there was no intention for it to continue in its current form. They suggested that knowledge stewardship could be transitioned into an administrative workstream focused on documentation.
Rowan supported the idea of treating knowledge stewardship as a label for a set of tasks rather than a formal workstream, allowing different individuals to pick up tasks as needed without requiring overall management.DAO Primitives: Rowan and rathermercurial discussed the DAO Primitives workstream, noting that while the foundational documents had been reviewed and feedback received, the workstream might not need to continue. Instead, the insights and tools developed could be integrated into other ongoing experiments. rowan emphasized that the DAO Primitives team would continue its work independently of the Reimagining Power Project (RPP) while collaborating on specific experiments when needed.Experiment PlanningCalgary Parks Impact Attestation:
rathermercurial explained that the experiment with Calgary Parks had been delayed due to stakeholders' summer schedules, but progress would be resumed in the fall, integrating it into the Gatherings program. The experiment aims to learn about participatory budgeting and impact tracking.
Rowan clarified the timeline for fall as September to November and noted that the gatherings would help gather information for the experiment.Equality Fund:
Michelle expressed challenges in coordinating with Sue for further scoping of the Equality Fund experiment, despite multiple attempts to engage. She suggested revisiting this during the stakeholder meeting and building time into the agenda for discussion.
Rowan and rathermercurial emphasized the need for high-bandwidth communication to determine the scope and potential of the experiment, acknowledging that the broad scope might need to be narrowed to make meaningful progress.Strategic Direction and Timeline ConcernsGeneral Discussion:
Michelle raised concerns about the project's timeline, noting that they are halfway through, with only six months remaining when excluding December. She suggested that if certain partners are not showing momentum, it might be necessary to shift focus to new experiments and partners.
Rowan agreed, stressing the importance of generating momentum within the core team's efforts and communicating this clearly to partners. He proposed creating "surface area" for partners to engage with ongoing projects, allowing them to step in if they see value.
rathermercurial highlighted the challenges of coordinating between fast-moving Web3 initiatives and slower traditional institutions, likening it to a phenomenon where differences in pace could tear efforts apart. They suggested facilitating spinout groups to continue moving forward while feeding insights back into institutions.Closing RemarksNext Steps:
The team agreed to focus on generating momentum in ongoing projects, creating clear opportunities for partner engagement, and reassessing workstreams to ensure alignment with the project's goals.
The Equality Fund and stakeholder alignment will be discussed further in the next meeting, with a view toward either progressing the experiment or reallocating resources to more active initiatives.
