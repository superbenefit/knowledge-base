==Here is an outline of a task management and compensation flow for a Cell to manage core team tasks. ==
==This is designed to be simple enough to be easily adopted by projects that SuperBenefit is spinning up (RPP & WREEP). It is assumed that this would be implemented using Tasks in Charmverse.  ==
## Overview
- The Core team of the Cell is responsible for defining and managing the Cell's tasks as part of its operational function.
- Tasks follow a simple template that captures the key information about a task including who is responsible for the task and what compensation is assigned to the completion of the task. 
- Tasks are managed through a task board from **creation** through to **completion.**
- Once completed tasks are reviewed by the core team compensation can be awarded.
- Teams can add whatever additional steps they think they need to manage their tasks. 

## Task Creation
1. Tasks can be created in two different ways:
	1. Tasks can come out of core team meetings as next steps for the project.
	2. Tasks can be proposed by individual core team members (or a group of them), raising them as proposed next steps.
	3. ==Note - thirdly, sub-tasks can be created within a specific task but these are managed by the task owner and not via this core team process==

## Task template
- ==Note - this template is designed to be used for external contributor task as well as for core team tasks. For a core team task (because of trust and high context) the task will be simple and fast to create, but if used for an external contributor it would likely contain a lot more detail. ==
	1. **Task name**:
	2. **Associated project or parent task:**
	3. **Task outline:**
		- **Purpose - **what are the goals, outcomes or outputs that the task is trying to achieve and how does this reflect the goals of the Cell. 
		- **Practice** - who is responsible for the task? Plus any other details that relate to the "how" of the task, including how the task will be rewarded - tokens, compensation etc
		- **Progress** - When is the task due and what does _Done_ look like? + description/evidence of completion of task. 
		- **Approved** - who approved the task for execution and when? E.g "Core team meeting + date"
		- **Complete** - when and by whom was the task reviewed and marked it as done? 


## Task management 
- ==Note - this simple task management process is designed for a Cell's core team to manage their tasks. If this is being used for managing large numbers of external contributors to the Cell then some additional steps will need to be added, or an entirely different process designed, depending on what was needed.   ==
- ==Note - the core team uses a kanban board for task management, with columns to manage task through their lifecycle. Something like: _Proposed, To-do, In progress, In review and Completed._==
- ==Note - the person/s responsible for a task can choose to allocate compensation to others as they see fit. This allows for task owners to engage contributors to perform subtasks as needed. ==

Using the Cell's **Task Board** (currently in Charmverse). As part of their team meeting the core team:
1. **Assigns tasks:**
	- Reviews tasks in _Proposed_ 
	- Agrees on an assigned compensation for each task
	- Prioritises and makes decisions on which tasks to approve for execution
2. **Provides on-going support** - discusses ongoing tasks as needed. People who are responsible for tasks can bring issues to the team and the team can amend timelines, compensation etc as needed
3. **Reviews tasks** - tasks in the _Review_ column are reviewed (outcomes/outputs) and marked as Complete (if complete) and moved to _Done_  
4. **Authorises compensation** - as agreed for completed tasks
5. ==Note - the above process is for tasks that have a defined reward and/or are being formally managed by the core team. Work that team members are doing that is outside of this can be logged as tasks in an **In-Kind Contributions** board. Here members can specify if they would like to be compensated for the task or not and the team can consider these at some point when funds are available. ==
