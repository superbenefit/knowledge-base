The goal of the Cell Setup workstream is to deploy and transition a minimum-viable set of coordination tools for the Core Team of the Reimagining Power cell.
# Setup Checklist
- [ ] 

# Tools
- The Reimagining Power cell uses common tooling for the management of cell-owned assets and information. Any tools deployed for the cell during the planning phase will be documented here.
- ## Meetings
	- ### Protocol Documentation
		- Check-In
		- Check-out
		- Decider
- ## Treasury
	- The cell uses a Safe multisig contract to custody on-chain assets in a secure, capture-resistant manner. Ownership of the Safe will be transitioned to the Core Team as it is operationalized.
	- ⬜️ POW-270 Multisig - Reimagining Power
- ## Workspace
	- Documents, tasks and projects are compiled in Clarity.
	- ✅ POW-268 Clarity Workspace - Reimagining Power

# Initial Agreements Conversation
- **Who are the stakeholders in this project, and how does this cell relate to them?**
	-  All In For Sport, Equality Fund, Reimagine Institute, SuperBenefit, Ontario Trillium Foundation
	- The core team should decide on a procedure for engaging stakeholders in strategic decision-making. This should serve to satisfy the stakeholders' need/desire for involvement to the greatest extend reasonably possible, without interfering with the cell's operational autonomy.
- **What are the goals for this project?**
	- Create a playbook to answer questions specific to needs of Stakeholders:
		- What does web3 uniquely enable to shift power and transform systems?
		- What new models does web3 offer for mobilizing and distributing capital toward transformative outcomes?
		- Where might web3 provide the greatest leverage for catalyzing systemic change? 
	- Design proof of concept for partner DAO/DisCo exploration, including framework for community engagement based on Stakeholders' stated needs.
	- Publish Stories, blog posts and other media related to the project.
- **Who will participate, and what are the requirements to do so?**
	- Participants have been selected on a flexible, opt-in basis and noted in the Cell State
- **Why, When and How will rewards be distributed?**
	- Retroactive rewards (denominated in USDC and SPRB) can be paid to contributors upon completion of tasks posted to the Cell's roadmap.
		- Contributions should be reviewed promptly upon completion. If approved, rewards should be disbursed during the "reflection" phase of the same revolution.
	- Pro-rata payments (aka "Retainer Fee") can be issued to role holders in order to secure their minimum expected time for each cycle based on their role.
		- The core team should decide on a base Retainer Fee for each role, and adjust for each revolution if necessary.
		- Commitments should be re-affirmed during the "Planning" phase of each revolution, with payments made before the start of the corresponding sprint.
	- Contributors can decide to create non-monetary rewards (POAP/NFTs, attestations, etc.) as desired to acknowledge & memorialize their contributions.
	- Ad-hoc reimbursements or rewards can be proposed using the default decision-making process.
- **How will major decisions be made?**
	- Major decisions (such as updating/ratifying the Cell State, modifying roles and updating project goals) can use consent-based decision making as described in the [Decider Protocol](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/decider).
		- Proposals should be posted in a new thread under the #reimagining-power Discord channel with a relevant title added.
- **How will decisions to allocate resources be made?**
	- Major resource allocation decisions (such as delegating a large portion of funds to a cycle or significant project) can be made using the major decision protocol.
- What roles do we need?
	- Who will serve as the point person(s)?
		- Rowan will serve as interim point person.
	- Who will be the Core Team for this project?
		- Core team has been self-selected and noted in the cell state.
- **How will we pace our work? Will we use sprints?**
	- Work can be paced using "revolutions" consisting of three phases:
		- 1-week Planning Phase
		- 2-week Sprint Phase
		- 1-week Reflection Phase
	- The first revolution can start during the week of August 21st
	- Sprints can be tracked in Clarity
	- **How will meetings be scheduled and conducted?**
		- Meetings can initially be scheduled by polling the #reimagining-power channel in Discord to schedule asynchronously. Can use LettuceMeet or similar tooling.
		- (policy) The cell should agree upon a regular weekly meeting schedule.
