# Purpose

`The purpose of this work as it relates to the RP project.`

_To identify barriers to meaningful participation in the Reimagining Power Project and to develop and implement onboarding tools and practices to reduce such barriers._

The overarching purpose of the Reimagine Power Project (RPP) is "To explore how web3 can shift power, transform systems and shape better futures. In particular, how the concept of DAOs as purpose-driven networks of small autonomous teams can redistribute power, value flows and resources across society at scale."

A key part of this exploration is shifting power within the RPP itself. One aspect of this is removing barriers to participation in the project. This Proposal creates a task to develop an understanding of what barriers exist and to help overcome these barriers by developing a suitable onboarding process.

## Expected Outputs / Goals

`The deliverables or outcomes needed from this work`

- A report on existing barriers to participation

- Comprehensive onboarding guide tailored for new participants, detailing project goals, DAO operations, and collaboration tools (including production of multimedia educational materials to cater to diverse learning preferences and needs - if resources allow)

  - Document, video, and/or graphic

  - Tools to include:

      - Discord

      - Charmverse

      - Figma

      - what else???

  - FAQ to cover:

    - What's the relationship between SB, AIFS & RPP?

    - How can I get involved? What can I do?

- A plan, agenda, and/or slideshow for a 30-minute onboarding workshop designed to educate new stakeholders and/or cell members about the project's core values, technologies, and methodologies

- Implementation of a feedback loop mechanism to continuously refine the onboarding process based on participant experiences and suggestions.

- Establishment of a community support network that fosters a sense of belonging and provides real-time assistance, which may include a mentoring and/or buddy program for new members.

- Design (and launch?) an outreach campaign to raise awareness about the project and attract a wider pool of potential participants.

- Formulation of a strategic partnership program with other DAOs and organizations to exchange knowledge, resources, and best practices for onboarding. (check this doesn't overlap with KM&S workstream)

##  Scope of Work

`What will this work cover? What domains of activity are involved?`

- **Review & Report:** Identify existing barriers in the RPP, focusing on:

  - Onboarding processes and materials

  - Tooling and technological infrastructure

  - Transparency and information dissemination, accessibility and information symmetry

- **Strategy Development:** Formulate and propose effective strategies to overcome these barriers, with a special emphasis on developing an onboarding flow and documentation to address the most pressing issues.

- **Broad Applicability:** Address different groups/types of people who may need to be onboarded and ensure that the material is both relevant to all of them and differentiates between their differing intentions/needs. For example:

  - Members of stakeholders' organizations 

  - New SuperBenefit community members eager to get involved 

### Exclusions

`What will this work not cover? What will be excluded from this workstream?`

- Scoping, reviewing, or implementing tooling already established by the DAO Primitives Cell

- Developing or publishing Playbook or Salons (part of other workstreams)

- **WREEP is contributing to some light Discord Onboarding setup****; they** **can make quests & sourcecred available after conclusion**

- CX is greeting and hosting 1-on-1's with new members of SuperBenefit; we won't duplicate that work

- DAO Primitives: no explicit exclusions relating to the DAO primitives Cell

- Knowledge Stewardship workstream includes wireframe/v1 RPP website; that is out of scope for the Onboarding workstream

# Practice

## Contributors

`Who may be interested in contributing to this work?`

- The wider SuperBenefit community

- Stakeholders (including different individuals at those organizations)

- Other DAOs who have a focus on onboarding more people into web3 (research/brainstorm a list)

## Resources

`What resources may be needed for this work?`

- A clear understanding of what onboarding work has already been completed by other cells or is in progress

- Help with designing/producing onboarding materials

## Information and Transparency

`What do you need to manage information related to this work in a transparent way?`

- Once approved, we will set up tasks for each sub-task that is part of the phases below and will keep documentation/deliverables relating to each task within that task on Charmverse. 

- We request the Core team's assistance in reviewing our outputs for clarity and comprehensiveness 

# Progress

## Pace & Milestones

`How will time, pace and progress milestones be approached for this work?`

- phase 1:

  - research/information gathering + strategy development

    - What onboarding mechanisms currently exist in SuperBenefit and in the RPP? **HEENAL**

    - What are other cells working on? **HEENAL**

    - What best practices exist in the field? **NICOLE**

    - What barriers to participation exist in RPP? **FILSAN**

      - Survey stakeholders and others to get a broader perspective on potential barriers

      - Formulate and propose effective strategies to overcome these barriers

  - develop an onboarding flow and documentation

  - design an onboarding workshop

  - design & test feedback mechanism

- phase 2: community engagement deliverables

  - complete remaining deliverables

### Cobudget Requested funding

- Set up feedback system & test in the field	$250.00

- Existing funds - Previous RPP Proposal	$1,000.00

## Completion

`What is the definition of "done" for this work?`

- This work is "done" once we are confident that people can be onboarded into the RPP without any member of the Core Team's direct involvement.

- Feedback loop mechanism implemented

Meeting April 30

Updates

- Nicole - has been researching best practices. A lot of generic info, but not a lot of specific details. Does anyone have info about good DAO onboarding? We could also look at best practices outside of this space.

  - Ask Shanny for Krause Haus info/connect

  - Ask Rather for examples of good onboarding

  - Michelle will forward info from Open Civics

- Filsan - barriers to participation. Stuck on how to approach stakeholders

  - let's brainstorm barriers together on this call and share with stakeholders ahead of SHG meeting next week and ask for their input
