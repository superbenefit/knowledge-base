## **Admin Workstreams**

### General Coordination:

- Work is underway to transition RP workstreams into operational tasks and admin functions.

- More work is needed to document tasks, especially for the purpose of increasing agency among the team and contributors.

### Onboarding:

- Status: 95% complete. The onboarding guide is still in progress. 

- Shift in Needs: The onboarding flow needs reassessment, as SBCX now has more capacity.

- Next Steps: Review the onboarding flow in Figjam, which has been drafted and reviewed. Examine how onboarding aligns with other groups and roles, and potentially streamline with SB Community Experience.

- Meetings: The RPP Social Impact and Onboarding bi-weekly meetings have been combined due to overlapping content and time constraints.

- Action: Michelle to check with HR on the status of onboarding.

### Social Impact:

- Paper Progress: The Social Impact paper is progressing, with plans to shift to a shorter summary to integrate insights into team design conversations.

- Stewards are creating a plan to draft the needed workflows to derive possible web3 intervention opportunities from stakeholder conversations based on the premises in the SI paper.

### Knowledge Stewardship:

- Phase 1: Complete, with some bounties still needing fulfillment.

- Phase 2: Ready to proceed, with assistance needed from onboarding to fill bounties.

- Databases: Created for various types of information generated by RPP, including topics/terms, artifacts, and links. Task Handling: No current process for managing tasks and bounties.

- Workstream Status: The Knowledge Stewardship workstream is no longer needed within RPP; contributors can use the KS admin workstream in Charmverse to track related work.

### Primitives:

- Initial Framing: Complete, but formatting for readability is needed based on core team feedback.

- Next Steps: (w/ SI workstream via stewards) Create a plan for identifying possible web3 solutions based on identified intervention areas from stakeholder conversations.

- Workstream Status: No need to continue the DAO Primitives Workstream beyond its current state.

## **Experiments**

### Calgary Parks Impact Attestation Experiment:

- Partially on hold. Prioritizing alternative experiment

- Involve Calgary in AIFS gatherings to merge threads and gain information on local pain points and participatory budgeting approaches.

- Alternative Experiment: Creating a Coordi-Nation pattern for AIFS to compliment Gatherings.

### Equality Fund:

- Scope: Potential experiment scope identified, with scoping session scheduling underway. 

  - Preference expressed for narrow scope to facilitate deep exploration and concrete insights

- Next Steps: Identify specific intervention areas and gather information for discovery and scoping. 

- Timeline: Fall/Winter, potentially identified. 

- Information: Sue has shared details on their allocation system.

### Institute for Community Sustainability:

- Experiment identified: Designing a DAO-like structure for ICS, to be discussed. 

  - Need to sync up w/ Heenal & Julia to 

- Parallel Work: Developing resources for local node experiments to support, potentially through the playbooks project, which could provide guidelines for establishing DAO-style local nodes.
