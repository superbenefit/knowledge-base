Welcome all, old and new
I've had a great summer, how about you?

Friends and family, many highlights
Surfing, dancing, mad skills on our bikes

Freedom comes in many different flavours
So many special moments to savour

While we enjoyed our families and our vacations
Our team's been busy with much collaboration

Moving this project forward quickly was our goal
So we created an operations and strategy steward role

How can we decentralize and still move fast?
How can we create impact that will last
While reimagining the power systems of the past?

Higher bandwidth, the space to meet ad hoc
Capacity to reflect and take stock
To make decisions as needed
So far the new structure has succeeded
In increasing our speed
Our workstreams
are merging into a river of knowledge
Our deliverables advance
This time now is the chance
To dive into our experiments

All In For Sport is
Piloting a playground for bringing together groups interested in exploring web3
Reimagining how the world of social impact could be
Piloting 5 sessions
A place to share questions
To build a community of practice
Bridging the gap between theory and praxis

Equality Fund is reimagining how participatory grant-making could be
Starting with their "Repair, Care and Respond" funding stream
They have 400 applications and need to get down to a dozen
That takes a lot of work, expertise, and discussion
It's not an efficient solution
Especially when we seek inclusion
And participation.
Let's develop an application
of web3 tech that we can run in a parallel process
To compare the results and see what worked best
Next step, a call to get clear on the scope
To get a clear idea that we can float
A single slice to test is what we hope

The Institute for Community Sustainability
Is scoping its a prototype

Together, we're getting ready for gatherings, the playbook is taking shape
We're full of energy, we're feeling great!

So many opportunities to unlock
Exploring podcasts, preparing blogs

We've been doing the groundwork
Now our seeds are starting to flower

This is our time, now is the hour
Together, we're reimagining power
