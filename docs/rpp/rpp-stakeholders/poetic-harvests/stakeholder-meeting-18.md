What brings you joy
on this sunny day
Whether in the future or today
Autumn or spring
It's the little things
We're masters of sports
Our time is short
Building our knowledge base
With different use cases
combinations of composable structures
choose your own adventure
crafting governance docs
And wrapping up experiments
With the Initial establishment
Of cells and teams
Of hopes and seeds
Successfully completed gatherings
collaborating with women win
Exploring data ownership
And the Future of superbenefit
As a Community governed innovation network
As we finish up our work
Here and deliver
Beyond metrics
Data synthetics
Commoning knowledge
Full of excitement and promise
And gratitude for this opportunity to be in 
Emergence
Convergence
Reverbrance
Calling in 
A fund
So more can get done
Partners ready for investment
Ready to experiment
To replicate and co-create
To onboard and engage
On a bigger stage
Surfing whatever waves we face
Our time is short
The future awaits
