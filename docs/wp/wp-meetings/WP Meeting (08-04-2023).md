- ## Discussion Topics:
	- **Notes from first call 4/9/23**
	- Overall objective to create a light paper on an NFT based energy sharing platform
		- Design - not a technical specification yet
		- 2 phases - 1 energy labeling design, what needs to be included 2. The interoperability component - how people can engage with the protocol
		- Windfall has the stakeholder group and can bring these together -
		- We need to coordinate the stakeholders and get feedback
			- Engage with the SH
			- Draft an approach - get feedback
			- Draft a final approach
		- Need to scope this as simply as possible
		- Talking with block science about contributing to the lite paper
		- This can explode in the different applications and uses of this. Can we design a coordination mechanism that does 2 things
			- 1 Design and delivery of the lightpaper
			- 2 Parallel process that engages with the stakeholder to explore what else can be done around the protocol - this is separate from the lightpaper
		- Core project focus is on energy efficiency in the Durham region. Designing for this will be the main focus of the light paper. The broader protocol (token and economic design) will be the parallel work stream
		- The first chunk of funds is for coordination
		-  design - this can include how we set up a shared resource pool that we can pull together to deliver on both work stream designs - This could include using SB's governance design on
			- 1. Participation in researching and delivering the lightpaper
			- 2. Pulling together stakeholders to explore the broader opportunity
		- We can carve out 20k ish for SB to cover the coordination set up
		- Perhaps Block Science could deliver the entire lite paper
		- Overall budget 140k - 40k to windfall for stakeholder and reporting to govt. Perhaps 60-70k CAD. This would leave 20-30k for SB + other funders that we would bring in
		- BwB or other could come in as a stakeholder
		- The stakeholder module design around this could be a looser design where stakeholders are brought into a "conversation" as funding contributors
		- Perhaps there is a mini implementation fund that can invest around the opportunity - creating an ecosystem of public goods funding around the protocol. E.g green municipal fund could contribute with the value prop being that there is genuine community governance around this fund. And commercial operators can use the protocol. Overtime we can build in a protocol fee to fund this in the future. Perhaps there is a dealflow aspect where funders get access to the projects developing on the protocol
