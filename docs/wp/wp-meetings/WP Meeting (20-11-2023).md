  - Then at the event / after the event - make an invitation that they can sign up and get some reward - perhaps an NFT coming after the first event. Then they let them know that they can joing the discord and signaling. 

  - We will need to see an updated deck before we schedule the next meeting (perhaps decide on this at the next meeting)

  - We can link to the gitbook pages for things like setting up a wallet. 

  - Strip back the programme info in the gitbook and lean on the Windfall website and bs docs instead. Just focus on the community.

  - The stakeholder group will sunset at the end of the project

  - The community events can happen in parallel or the stakeholder channels/events can transition into the community if that works better

- Discuss compensation now that funds have hit the Cell wallet

With rage quit for capital contributors Mix of potential funders - insurance cos, govt grant funding programmes, philanthropics, Ideally, we have an open ended vehicle. Need to solve the fiat conversion. Get a small lead sponsor - Some of the activity could be operationalised through a cell as well as being pushed out as funding to wider community opportunities **Investment/capital fund - for implementation**
