	- Michael/Rowan write a launch post for community launch 
	- Put together a discussion/topic calendar for community channel
- ## Planning
	- **Setting up Project Stewardship Group**
		- Have the weekly meeting serve as the PSG meeting as well. The PSG can figure out its own communication separately.  
	- **Mapping pilot stakeholders **
		- Windfall/Brent is holding this and is mapping the SHG and making introductions. BS will choose who they want to speak with. Brent will make the introduction. 
		- Customer interviews list for BS to choose from - these will take a month
	- **Plan for pilot stakeholder group engagement **
		- Brent will make contact with Pilot SHG members to onboard them to the project?
		- Core team will manage the onboarding flow to the comms and feedback channels
		- BS will create an initial grounding doc (landscape of the existing state and problems). When this is done we will bring in the broader SHG we will push go on onboarding the stakeholders - probably mid November
		- BS's initial grounding doc - when it's starting to take shape we will move it gitbook and open up for comment and discussion in discord. 
		- Onboarding flow for discord is here [https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/project/298](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/project/298) 
			- Set up wallet instructions
				- Self service wallet set up - e.g rainbow
				- Put together simple instructions on how to get a wallet. Include a link to a 1on 1 to get help if they need it. 
		- Set up an Onboarding event 
			- Pick a date for the onboarding session  
		- Comms management 
			- Ongoing discussion - use discord threads. 
			- Perhaps set up a SB code of conduct to sit over the discord channels 
			- Confidentiality/NDA - not needed as they will only see public information - perhaps use chatham house rules in a code of conduct and setting the tone for the group
			- Set up a wreep only notifications page so that people don't get overwhelmed by the discord
			- Do other paring down of the SB discord work
			- Put something in the "choose a role" channel for what channels people want to see 
			- Design the language for setting the tone/context for the group. 
			- Put together a simple code of conduct that includes Chatham House rules
			- Include the ability for people to post anon. Set up the channel invite for people to be able to sign up with an eth address only, so they can register an anon account. 
			- Have a person/s who can support the right kinds of conversations in the channel
		- **Formal temp checks at draft and final**
			- Snapshot for temp checks
				- Check with BS if they want to break the drafts into pieces to temp check it. (discuss this with BS at this week's meeting)
				- Perhaps use multiple ongoing snapshots that cover different pieces and then people change their votes over time
				- Try to reward people with tokens for regularly updating their votes on snapshot
		- Perhaps use Lore for the community group management
	- **Setting up the project Community**
