# Meeting Agenda

Weekly meeting agenda & notes for the WREEP web3 core team.

## Updates

- Docs fully updated and waiting for final language.

- GitBook core product no longer actively developed and functionality is degenerating; Recommend reducing dependency on the platform

  - (this is an overly-critical, harsh and inaccurate statement that I stand behind nonetheless \~rm)

- live snapshot setup needed(?)

- Key pieces for the initial draft of the litepaper in place - draft ready for Jan 1 

- Diagram for docs [https://www.figma.com/file/QrzB4UI06FPHkOng075fuw/WREEP---Coordination-Design?type=whiteboard&t=wprCMkk1eu5VGWni-1](https://www.figma.com/file/QrzB4UI06FPHkOng075fuw/WREEP---Coordination-Design?type=whiteboard&t=wprCMkk1eu5VGWni-1)
