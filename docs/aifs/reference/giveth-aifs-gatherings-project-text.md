# All In For Sport: Web3 & Impact Gatherings

## Project Description

[**All In For Sport](https://www.allinforsport.org/)** (AIFS) is an experiment to bring together diverse communities in Emerging Tech, Web3 and Sports to learn, share and co-create community initiatives that advance inclusion and empowerment through sport around the world. 

We believe that sport can be a major catalyst for social change, equity, and community resilience, but existing systems are not designed to action community support where it is needed. 

We believe philanthropy has an opportunity to outsize impact by supporting sport: if reimagined. We have created AIFS 'Gatherings' to explore innovative projects, share learnings and understand how web3 tech may integrated to begin provide new solutions forward.

## About the Gatherings Education Project

Gatherings are a sandbox for innovation that bring together diverse groups across sectors to share knowledge, collaborate and innovate with the aim of accelerating social change through sport. 

The gatherings are open to anyone interested in the topics and the outcomes of the discussions, notes, recordings and guides, are public goods that are shared and available for anyone to access, use and build off of. Up to this point, we have hosted 5 gatherings, with 111 participants from 31 organizations on the following topics.

**Session 0: Community Partners Co-Creation Session.** Intros to the gatherings and our goals Meet community partners; setting priorities for impact and co-creation 

**Session 1: How can Emerging Technology Enable Social Impact.** Introducing blockchain, AI, and decentralized technologies for good.

**Session 2: Community & Collaborative Governance.** How can tech enable 'by community for community'? Designing participatory, community-led decision-making models.

**Session 3: Trusted impact. Measuring Community Value through Community Attestations.** Reimagining how we attest, validate and communicate stories and impact from conceptualization to implementation

**Session 4: AI - Where is the tech leading us?** Addressing trust, data sovereignty, and the ethical use of AI in social impact.

**Session 5: Transforming Capital**. Exploring participatory grantmaking, participatory investing, and impact investing; scaling, deploying and tracking funding; How can we look at Capital beyond the financial?

## What's Next

Our first round of Gatherings has given us valuable insights and momentum, showing a clear demand for continued conversations, deeper explorations, and real-world applications of Web3 from various diverse sectors. 

Moving forward, we aim to:

1. Expand our Gatherings - Our aim through these gatherings is to onboard over 100 projects from the sport and social impact space into Web3 and create a space for education, connection and collaboration.

2. Co-create open-source tools, research, and frameworks - developing public goods that can inform practice, policy, funding, and governance across sectors.

3. Pilot novel funding and coordination mechanisms - including quadratic funding, tokenized community governance, and participatory grantmaking.

## Why This Matters 

Traditional philanthropy and sports funding models are outdated, centralized, inefficient, and ineffective in supporting grassroots innovation and collective action towards human liberation and flourishing.

By integrating Web3 principles of transparency, decentralization, and community ownership, we can transform how power and capital flow to impactful community initiatives.

Join us in reshaping how sport, tech, and philanthropy intersect - let's build a more inclusive future together!
