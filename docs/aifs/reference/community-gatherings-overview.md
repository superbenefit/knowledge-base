# Community Gatherings

*November 13, 2024 - March 12, 2025*  
*Presented by The All In For Sport Team*

## About All In For Sport

All In For Sport is exploring how Emerging Technology can be leveraged for social good in sports.

All In For Sport is an experiment to bring together diverse communities in Emerging Tech and Sports to learn, share and explore community initiatives that advance inclusion and empowerment through sport around the world.

We know sport can be a major catalyst toward inclusion and empowerment in communities. But to date, existing systems have not been designed to action community support where it is needed. We believe philanthropy has an opportunity to outsize impact by supporting sport: if reimagined.

We invite you to join us our community in a five part session of 'Gatherings' to explore innovative projects, share learnings and understand how web3 tech may integrated to begin provide new solutions forward.

## About the Gatherings Project

This is an opportunity for AIFS to create a sandbox for innovation. Our goal is to bring in diverse groups currently innovating and creating social change through sport. Over a period of five sessions, we will address topics ripe for innovation such as governance, funding challenges, and impact measurement.

The goal is to build a community of supports with these innovators in sport. At the same time, we will invite developers and thought leaders in the social impact space to participate and help identify opportunities for exploration and development of ideas in the web3 space.
