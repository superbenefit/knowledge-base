# All In For Sport Workspace

_Collaborative workspace for All In For Sport's operations group._

## AIFS Overview

All In For Sport (AIFS) is an ambitious project with a long-term aim of bringing together web3 and sports communities to create a perpetual funding mechanism for grassroots initiatives advancing inclusion and empowerment through sport.

Sport has a unique ability to unite people across boundaries, making it a natural space to engage communities in transformative ways. By supporting local, community-led efforts, AIFS hopes to foster healthy, diverse, and inclusive environments where sport becomes a powerful tool for both personal and collective growth.

AIFS aims to leverage the potential of web3 technologies to redistribute power and resources equitably, shifting decision-making and funding control directly to communities. The goal is to continuously evolve the tools and structure, ensuring that AIFS can adapt to meet the needs of different regions, sports, and groups worldwide while demonstrating how web3 can transform sports, communities, and the social impact ecosystem.

## AIFS & Reimagining Power

All In For Sport is a Stakeholder in the Reimagining Power project.

## Gatherings

_As at October 2024, the Gatherings project is the primary focus of AIFS's attention and resources._

The Gatherings project aims to create interactive, participatory online events that foster a community of practice, enabling participants to co-learn, collaborate, and build meaningful connections. These dynamic spaces emphasize using collective intelligence to tackle real-world challenges through mastermind sessions and case study approaches. 

Gatherings are co-created by participants, developing a continuously evolving resource or "curriculum" that reflects the community's shared expertise and insights.

Within AIFS, Gatherings offer a sandbox environment where innovators in sport and social impact come together to explore governance models, funding strategies, and community development through web3. Designed to be inclusive, the sessions are accessible to participants at any level of familiarity with web3. 

Thought leaders, practitioners, and grassroots organizers collaborate to explore solutions and share learnings, ensuring discussions remain practical, relevant, and impactful. Through this flexible and evolving structure, Gatherings aim to create a sustainable network, empowering participants to address challenges and unlock new opportunities at the intersection of sport, web3, and social impact.
