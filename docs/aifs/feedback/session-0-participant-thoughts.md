# All In For Sport DAO Salon Series - Session 0 Participant Thoughts

This document captures initial thoughts shared by participants at the beginning of Session 0 of the AIFS DAO Salon Series.

## What are you thinking about, related to community governance, sport and Web3, as you join us today?

### Initial Thoughts

- Collaboration and a love for new governance models
- How can we get started with an experiment? Which organizations and/or communities are ready to start on a project today?
- I was asked, and when I saw the subject and people I couldn't say no.
- To create space to learn, share and grow together.
- Better understanding and build off of the orientation last time to continue furthering knowledge of how this could be a great fit for projects within my organization
- Connect, learn, and ideate with rockstar peers :)
- I love learning new things and how we can create a more equitable space in sport!
- Grow my tribe.
- There are bankless challenges in non-infrastructure environments that through the intersection of sports x governance x web3 we can channel impact to
- I think we need to be concerned not with models but with how humans do things together and what problems we have that we will carry in to these new forms of community
- Learn more about different models and ideas that bring people together
- Anticipating new tech
- Thriving together through sport and tech
- Always keen to hear about how emerging tech and ideas are being used in our own field and in other fields to see how it can shape the way our org and communities can grow and learn
- Excited to be here. New to web3. Was super active in various aspects of sports (incl sound eng for MLS, NFL, NBA), former comms manager @ DC Parks & Rec. Supporter of Aspen Inst & kids sports. /1
- 2/ I'm also interested in governance & policy. As well as some of the unique ways that web3 is utilized in everyday spaces & places. Also starting a platform - web3Newbie, I Am - to educate /3
- 4/ & bring everyday ppl, web2 ppl to web3. Plus learning about DAOs. I think web3 will be #theNorm in 5 yrs & a mandatory way the world lives/interacts in 10-15 yrs. Love the intersectionality here.
