# All In For Sport DAO Salon Series - Retro After Gathering 0

This document captures the team's reflections and feedback after the initial gathering of the AIFS DAO Salon Series.

## What went well

- We presented info clearly and got people excited.
- Lots of engagement from partners.
- Got diverse and valuable contributions to the 8 guiding questions we asked.

## Shout outs

- Rather & Jose - the tech worked flawlessly.
- Nicole - impeccable hosting!
- Shanny - great job getting so many partners to attend and engage.

## What could have gone better

- More engagement on Discord after the call.
- Maybe didn't need two rounds of people introducing themselves to participate in.
- Would have liked more clarity on which sessions each org was most keen to participate in.

## Ideas for future gatherings

- Make it participant-led as much as possible. Consciously ensure that skilled speakers take up less than 50% of the airtime.
- Get folks to engage on Discord DURING the Gathering and give a brief Discord tour.
- Not sure where all participants are on their web3 journeys, but maybe a short Discord "web3 adventure tour" could be valuable.
- Looking forward to presenting the EF and/or ICS experiments as somewhat of "new things going through the RPP, adjacent to these Gatherings.
