# AIFS Gatherings Introduction

## Why are we doing these sessions?

We know that the traditional philanthropic systems are broken. True impacts in marginalized communities remain largely unchanged due to the influence of historical systemic oppression.

This often results in insufficient resources to drive long-term impact, keeping these communities in a cycle of dependency rather than empowerment.

A new approach is needed.

## About AIFS

All In For Sport (AIFS) is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) whose mission is to create a coordi-nation for community led projects that advance inclusion and empowerment through sport.

## Our collaborators

### Super Benefit DAO

SuperBenefit's mission is to develop the social and financial flywheels that enable the invention and acceleration of a better world. This includes strengthening capacities for systems innovation and supporting people to clarify pathways towards shared goals.

### Reimagining Power Project

The Reimagining Power Project is exploring how emerging web3 technologies can be leveraged to redistribute power, mobilize capital, and transform systems toward more equitable outcomes.

## Collectively, we know:

Communities and those who design and implement sports projects often have:
- little influence of impact assessments
- limited access to resources
- limited local decision making

## So these sessions are meant to explore how emerging tech can enable:

- coordination at scale
- equitable access to capital
- community governance

By connecting those in community and the funding space with those with knowledge of the tech.

## Through the sessions we will:

- Share KNOWLEDGE
- Grow CONNECTIONS
- Seed NEW PROJECTS
