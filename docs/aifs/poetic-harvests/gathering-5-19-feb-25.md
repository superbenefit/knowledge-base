# AIFS Gathering 5 - 19 Feb 25

Welcome, friends—gather near,  
Not just to hear, but to shape, to steer.  
To unmake the past, to reimagine anew,  
To shift how power forms and moves  

We've asked before—where does tech lead?  
How do we measure what communities need?  
How do we govern, how do we share?  
What can we shift—do we dare?  

Capital flows—but who holds the key?  
Who decides what is given for free?  
Who hoards the wealth, who pays the price?  
Who reaps the spoils, who rolls the dice?  

For too long, capital meant just one thing—  
Money, extracted, governed by a king.  
But wealth is far more than a sum—  
It's trust, it's care, it's hands made one.  
It's culture, land, the skills we trade,  
It's knowledge passed, it's love conveyed.  

Yet still, we build on shaky ground,  
Where wealth is taken, not spread around.  
Where those in need must scrape and fight,  
While others hoard, where might is right  

Let's be glocal, let's share and ground  
let's Build what lifts, where love surrounds
Let's hyperactively build public goods
Because we can, because we should  

But what if capital learned to bend?  
To lift, to heal, to empower, to mend?
No longer tools of state control,  
But streams that nourish, make us whole.  


Let's reimagine what giving can be,  
Pooling funds through quadratic streams.  
Tokens, votes—each choice refined,  
So value flows by hearts aligned.  
No gatekeeper, no central hand,  
Just power spread across the land.  
No wealth that drowns, no wealth that dies,  
But a network built to lift and rise.  

Some need ways beyond the banks,  
Where systems crack **and trust runs dry.**  
Inflation swells, access denied,  
Communities left to fend, survive.  
So we build anew, we find a way,  
Decentralized, untethered, they stay.
A network rising, funds that flow,  
Not to hoard, but to help things grow.  

What if wealth was not a chain,  
But something living, something that sustains?**  
Not stored, but flowing— a sacred tide,  
A sea that lifts us all **worldwide.**  

This is why we gather today,  
To learn, experiment, to find a way.  
Beyond money, beyond greed,  
To flows of trust that serve real need.  

So we ask—what will we build?  
What wealth exists yet unfulfilled?  

when power shifts, when hands are freed,  
let capital become a seed.  
Let's gather, learn, and plant it deep,  
A world remade that's ours to keep.  

Not just a dream, the work's work begun—  
A future held by everyone
A thriving future for everyone
