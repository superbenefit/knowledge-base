# AIFS Gathering 3 - 22 Jan 25

Impact measurement and emerging technology
When you hear those words together, what comes to mind?
How can this combination benefit humankind? 

There's so much good work around impact measurement
How can we leverage and accelerate it? 
We're imagining a field more equitable and open
Traditional philanthropic systems are broken
Communities kept in a cycle of dependency
A new approach is what we need
A coordi-nation to empower 
Serving not funders' purpose, but ours

Emerging tech can enable impact, connecting funders with tech knowledge
Sharing knowledge, Growing connections, seeding new projects

What type of impact do you measure or try to achieve?
How can this be amplified by the technologies of web3?

Upe is a grassroots community organization
Curating and disseminating hyperlocal information 
In their experiment, 11 out of 12 NGOs created wallets
Not a 100$ take-up, but still pretty solid!

An Arbitrum grant spurred local sponsors to agree
Money was the Trojan horse to onboard folks to web3
Zero cost attestations
Issued to local impact organizations
Enabled community participation
There are so many applications


It's a modern form of portfolio creation
Receipts to prove you put in the work—validation
No need for trophies or ribbons—embrace liberation
No way of faking it—on-chain verification


We're creating waves of change
Reducing waste, coral restoration
Open water certifications 
Using web2 tech as our current foundation
Until web3 enables retroactive compensation
If you want more information
Don't worry, we'll be sharing these presentations


A vision of a future where every girl and woman exercises their rights
Change at 3 levels, together we reach new heights

individual, institutional, systemic
Together, we step into power

Shifting Attitudes, conditions, knowledge, status, behaviour
We're Connector, space holder, resources, cultivator

Away from Funders focussed on Vanity metrics
To really measuring merit
The human element is core
We need so much more
Of that

Measure what matters, measure what's important to you
Weaving data and story, revealing what's true
Both facts and feelings hold vital clues

We're creating a space to learn together, mapping our shared atlas
We're working, exploring where impact meets participatory practice
