# Fiscal Sponsorship Arrangement
## Unlocking Capital & Tech for Grassroots Sport Project

**Date:** August 27, 2025

**Fiscal Sponsor:** The Reimagine Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS)

**Project Lead:** AIFS Consortium

**Funder:** Women Win

### Overview
The Reimagine Institute for Community Sustainability serves as fiscal sponsor for the AIFS Consortium's "Unlocking Capital & Tech for Grassroots Sport" project, enabling the receipt and disbursement of grant funds from Women Win.

### Fund Management Process

1. **Receipt of Funds:** ICS will receive grant funds from Women Win in USD through traditional banking channels.

2. **Transfer Timeline:** Within 14 days of receipt, ICS will transfer the full amount to the AIFS Consortium's designated multi-signature wallet established specifically for this project.

3. **Disbursement Schedule:**
   - First tranche: 50% of total grant upon contract signing
   - Second tranche: 50% following approval of mid-year report

4. **Financial Oversight:** The AIFS Consortium will maintain transparent, public records of all project expenditures through its on-chain treasury management system.

### Rationale
This arrangement is necessary because the AIFS Consortium operates as a decentralized organization using blockchain infrastructure and does not maintain traditional banking relationships. ICS's role as fiscal sponsor enables the project to receive conventional grant funding while maintaining the consortium's innovative governance and financial management approach.
