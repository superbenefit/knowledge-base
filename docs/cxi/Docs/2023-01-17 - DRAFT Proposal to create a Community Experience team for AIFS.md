## Purpose
To map, engage, mobilize and provision the communities around AIFS to inform, participate in and contribute to AIFS's purpose.
## Accountabilities
- Creating spaces for community activity to emerge
- Engaging community members into different kinds of roles

## Background
As AIFS approaches the Gitcoin Beta round, there is a need to tell the story of AIFS in order to engage the wider web3 community in our Purpose with the goal that they will become early adopters and financial supporters of the DAO's vision. 
As there is more interest in AIFS from both within and outside the web3 space over the course of the Beta round and beyond, there will also be a need to onboard people into the AIFS community so that they can find their place and contribute to AIFS's Purpose.
This proposal is seeking endorsement from the early AIFS community to set up a Community Experience team to develop and host community spaces and communications in order to meet these needs.
## Purpose
Creating a Community Experience cell allows those with a passion for building community to come together and work effectively on designing and implementing the Community Experience strategy for AIFS, in partnership with the rest of the emerging AIFS community. 
## Design
We will set up a Community Experience team in AIFS to hold conversations and make proposals about community experience as AIFS evolves into its future shape. 
- The team will be set up with transparency built in. Anyone can see how the team are making decisions and what we are working on at any time. It will also be open for anyone in the network to come along and contribute to.
- Having this team doesn't stop anyone else in the AIFS network from developing different community experience ideas and approaches and proposing them to the community as well (this is not about creating exclusive control of the network's community experience). 
- Outreach and engagement opportunities could include:
	- Twitter Spaces with community and tooling partners; social media engagement (Twitter, Instagram); Townhalls, Podcast guest, cross discord posting etc.
	- Onboarding resources and initiatives
	- Setting up Discord and/or other communications channels

## Momentum
@MBaldwin and @heenal are committed to this work. There is some sense of urgency as the Gitcoin Beta round in March approaches and it would be optimal to begin hosting community events in February in order to maximize the funding round's chances of success.
## First steps
Put out a call to the people already involved in AIFS conversations to pull in interested contributors.
Set up a team structure and tools to provide transparency to the community and help the team function effectively. 
## Details
Please respond to the Fist-to-Five on this proposal in the AIFS Telegram (or vote via Snapshot if that is set up by the time this Proposal is voted on.....)
