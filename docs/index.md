This section contains working documents organized by authoring group. Here you'll find active research, project documentation, and collaborative materials that are still being developed and refined.

Each subdirectory represents a working group or project area within the SuperBenefit community. Ideas grow here through collaboration before maturing into structured records in our [Resources](data/resources/index.md) and [Lexicon](data/concepts/index.md).

## What You'll Find

*   **Project Documentation:** Materials from specific initiatives and working groups
*   **Research in Progress:** Ideas being actively developed and refined
*   **Emerging Patterns:** Concepts that haven't yet been formalized into the resource library
