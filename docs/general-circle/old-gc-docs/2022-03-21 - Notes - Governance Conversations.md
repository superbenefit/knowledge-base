# Governance Sense-making proposal (notes)

*** 2 proposals - conversation and research
Start a thread in #proposal-development on Discord to get input 
Announce in general channel 
## Overview
- one of the most interesting (and relevant) topics right now is how systemic resilience (and collective governances) is emerging and being developed right now. led in defi where there have been the most iterations and greatest need (financial risks, pain, and gains)... and now moving into dao2dao and ecosystem resilience (e.g. refi and regen).
- We could put this together as a bounty project for a small team to go after. The insights we gain will pay dividends across all of the different SB workstreams/invitations. If we play the curation role it de-centers us from the work and builds our credibility


## Project phases
- Phase 1: Initial research project to map the current state of innovation in DAO/DeFi/ReFi governance
- Phase 2: Series of 3 panels (Twitter Spaces) - broad exploratory conversations with people active in web3 governance, plus doing interesting things in governance in the non-web3 world
- Phase 3: Consolidating the information gleaned from Phases 1 and 2 into a final deliverable/artifact 


## Planned timeline
### Week 1-3
	- Finalise the series name, format, themes & promotion plan
	- Invite speakers
	- Invite people into Roles
### Week 4-6
	- Initial 3 Twitter spaces
	- Invite participants to continue the conversations in SB Discord
	- Publish a Mirror post following each Twitter space
### Week 7-8
	- Analysis of all the sessions and common learning, themes and create artifact 


## A multi-project approach
✅ SUP-222 Proposal for Governance Research Project (Rev1)
- We want it to produce useful things really quickly
- Keep the scope small, long projects tend not to work well in DAOs
- Make sure we are not duplicating what is already out there. See this article: [https://blog.withtally.com/dao-governance-challenges-ideas-and-tools-1504fd82be24](https://blog.withtally.com/dao-governance-challenges-ideas-and-tools-1504fd82be24) 
- We can spin up a new multisig for the project to decentralize the authority for allocating the budget

⬜️ SUP-220 Curate the metagovernance pieces into the web3 library 
⬜️ SUP-221 Create appropriate category/ies in web3 library and make video to show process for adding items to library 
✅ SUP-223 Proposal 4: Initiate the Governance Conversations project (Rev 1)
## Questions
- Do we want to apply for metagovernance funding for Phase 1?
	- Yes
	- ⬜️ SUP-224 Apply for metagov.org funding for research project

**Provocations**
"nature does not do governance" - embed the ecosystem dynamically respond based on its own interactions - some connections to Indigenous governance - human system as adaptive system and about restoring balance
-our governance is about rule following and risk oriented partly due to the scale of institutions and power and control
-policy and compliance (rule following), 20th century about process; higher level of thought structures in flexible and useful ways @Rowan  has image - if you think you are a thing you need to protect, if everything micro or fractal then less of a thing and more of a collective and generates more freedom
-lack of constraints of regulation, finance and exactly what required governance to become with scale 
-barter economies was not an earlier stage to money, governance and money go hand in hand,
