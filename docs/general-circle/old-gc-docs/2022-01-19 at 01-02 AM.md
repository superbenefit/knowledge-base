Make web3 inclusive
- don't bring same ways of web2 forward
- average crypto owner is 33 year old male making $100K/year - need to not create same stereotype in web3
- Boyz Club - for women and non-binary, 9 part dinner series in NY city, online community in discord and creating content, educational content that is entertaining
- Yes Queen Club - research shows that space is not welcoming of 2SLGBTQ, and need to bring these perspecitves
- Forefront - community operations side, media DAO, focus on culture and web side of web3 
- Crypto Besties - make up line, focused on women
- Block Chain at Berkley - Darya - blockchain enabled future to have financial and self determination, Satchel - [https://www.cryptoaltruism.org/blog/satchel-using-defi-to-help-unbanked-communities-generate-income](https://www.cryptoaltruism.org/blog/satchel-using-defi-to-help-unbanked-communities-generate-income) 
- Sexism in the space - create small pods of people who are more diverse and care about making it more diverse than it is today
- Radia - NFT characters of touring travelling artists and Jessicalawson.eth
- how to break things down so people can see themselves as part of it and show that you don't need to spend thousands of dollars in NFT space to be part of web3
- onboarding and onramping is so important and often a missing step but that is only part of it, more intention is needed for retention for those underrepresented groups are in the community, so they valued and included - studies on retention levels would be a good next step
- not enough representation for women, Latino community but because not many crypto communities to ask questions, barriers - services or products being produced for specific user and not focused on Latino community or educational content in Spanish
- Time - especially free time - is a huge privilege 
- Culture is key. We can onboard people but do they feel welcome and comfortable? Else they will leave 
- Discord is not super easy to navigate and has been a barrier and other platforms are being created that have same functionality but easier to navigate
- Fundamentals of DeFI, DAOs, NFT have been ironed as a baseline but now how can we use these to make application level tools to crete
- how to centre people not the technology, for people to be the source of focus, seeing this in the DAO space
- Stop throwing money at problems, more organizations that are focused on helping and being social conscious and needs more of that - solve real world problems 
- need to create spaces where people can ask any question, literally anything
- Using SOL because lower gas fees and trying to make it more accessible than etherium 
- research shows that women are more risk adverse than men, but some questions related to this
- how to get into web3 for less than $50 to make it more accessible
- Heenal shared - not just about tokenism, DEI is fundamental to the future we want, if web3 is not diverse we will miss on perspectives, learning, human wisdom - we will create the same systems of anglo-centric cultural hegemony. Web3 technologies can be the building blocks of the future - already redefining finance, art, governance, ownership, culture, the world of work. Has potential of a cultural shift and civilizational shift - if it's just tech, gamers, young people we will miss out on those who are activists, social innovators, grassroots organizing, people with decades of experience. Inclusion should not just be an add-on in a DAO or an extra channel in Discord; it should be fundamental to the culture and baked into what you are doing. This is a turning point in time and we have a unique opportunity to shape the direction that our society goes in. How will we choose to use that opportunity?
- If have to be tech savvy or financial savvy and does it mean cannot contribute or benefit - need to change the discourse - the people who are going to make web3 inclusive are not here - not just an inside job it is an outside job - ask when taking course ask if can accept stablecoins, or can pay in crypto - intro convo in new ways not just talk about smart contracts because may not be relevant for those you are connecting with

- IDEAS
	- I don’t think anyone has done a study of retention or a demographic survey of the web3 space. Maybe this is something SB could do as part of its sensing/sensemaking work?
