# Questions for Caryn Tan (CCS)



_Zoom Meeting March 11, 2022_

- **What are the boundaries for Community Experience vs Culture?**
	- relationship between culture and community experience
	- culture over arches the whole org/DAO/brand - community experience is intertwined and is a subset of that culture
	- what is the journey of the people who are coming into the community - mutliples journeys for those coming in - tiered private/public - let's assume token gated community - is everyone homogenous or are there different needs - user exepreince in web 2.0 and catering to those needs
	- who are those users and personas, cater to that and does that gets more complicated
	- C Club - Community Manager - token gate for a C Club for the discord, C Club cohorts - 4 Tiers - venture capital DAO
	- culture - people are not designing community experience are part of creating fabric of the culture - they have adjacent directly or indirectly 
- ==How to get engagement in Discord?==
	- community experience is limited to the functionality of Discord
	- need to go through that curve
	- when first got interested in this area, started with Twitter, as interest grew you go to their bio, lead to going to Discord
	- ***so SB Twitter will be important tool of engagement
	- make Discord less overwhelming - onboarding flow- one of the best practices wants to write about - stagger entry into Discord - once click values, open verification channel and then into orientation - use a bot - - connect bot to the server  - clicking of emjoji and sign themselves that role - role linked to other channels opening up
	- CCS - verification channel - collab-land - can only see if you have this NFT
	- element of community design and onboarding
	- difference is CCS token-gated 
	- do you have to start discussions, moderate discussions?  
	- Clarity discord - customer support and trying to move it towards a community
	- Pose a question group - people will engage with those questions 
	- Create a thread of real life questions - and so everyone starts to connect - where are people IRL 
	- do people want to be chatting in Discord 
	- how do you create a win win for those coming in - psychology - intrinsic motivation - onboard each person, what do you want to contribute, what gets you to jump out of bed every morning, how does it fit with road map, how can we help with their needs
	- what does a journey in our DAO look like, highs and lows and barriers - brainstorm 12 week road map, metrics of what community progress looks like - these are experiments (tried threads and when become channels, why some more active and built playbook in Clarity - list out things learning an doing
	- 1:1 is needed for detailed relationships that meets needs - 
	- after 12 weeks will write about the experiment around community experience
- ==What tools do you use as a "CRM" or a network map to track members in community, contributions?==
	- use Airtable to track when applied, submitted, bought NFTs, have not done more intricate tracking 
	- tracks threads and how many
	- 1:1 curated intros and started to build that out for applicants - looking tell me about yourself, key words and created new columns - who said marketing across 300 applicants for example 
	- how to capture what people are interested - many DAOs asking this same question - one way is for them to tell you and find a place for their interest which is reactive - within team map out what you need and lay out in clarity and allow permissions for people to contribute e.g CabinDAO does it well - use clarity and permissionless and 
- What metrics do you track relating to CX? How do you know if what you're doing is "working"?
- What do your General Circle (or equivalent) meetings and other internal communications look like? What is the role of CX within the overall team?
- What do you find are the toughest aspects or where you or CCS gets stuck related to community experience?
	- toughest - community can be all consuming job - creating boundaries because you can always be doing more and whether incrementally beneficial - what % of time for connections or moderating
	- where get stuck - personally very extroverted so remembering that others are introverted and maybe just listening and don't want to see stuff - whole discourse in community management about to not get people to not lurk 
- Do you have an example of a Contributor Guide?
	- Clarity based at CabinDAO - and Clarity helping them
	- DAO Masters - they have a contribution guide 
	- Seed Club
	- Caryn and Clarity are working to support DAOs to create Contributor Guides
- How do you welcome new people? 
- How valuable is it to send out an email newsletter and/or updates via Twitter?
- How much following up with people feels like too much?
- How does equity show up in CCS discussions & processes?
	- decolonizing web3 - discord servers for different languages, all channels in different languages or some have some languages 
	- safe spaces - intentional about your code of conduct and who is the community manager - representation and who comes into your server, leadership roles and whether representative
	- 
- What gives you energy as a community experience lead?
- What is your hope/dream for a) CCS b) your role in web3 1/2/5 years from now?
