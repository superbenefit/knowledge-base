#[264 Systems Transformation Project](264%20Systems%20Transformation%20Project) #[drafts/sb-clarity/Tags/nucleus](drafts/sb-clarity/Tags/nucleus) #systems transformation 
**UPDATE (July 25, 2023):** This Cell has been wound down, as its work has been completed. The learnings and insights from the Cell's work has informed the #[reimagining power](docs/rpp/index.md) project cell (see [Reimagining Power proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/superbenefit.eth/proposal/0xdee77e3d0c41591bec2b880928755295a3bb4658a7950a95a7e954cac6c189c2)). This Cell's Resources have been transferred to Reimagining Power and many of the contributors from this Cell are now contributing to Reimagining Power. Jump into the [Reimagining Project Clarity group](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/group/POW) or the #reimagining-power Discord channel or contact @MBaldwin or @heenal if you would like to join the project or if you have any questions.

# Purpose & Insight
- To build a repository of DAOs and other web3 projects that go beyond charity/philanthropy impact and align with agreed-upon definitions of “systems transformation”, and to analyze what has enabled and constrained their systems transformation aspirations.

# Decision making: governance & treasury
- ## Coordination protocols & tools
	- ### Relationship and Responsibilities to SuperBenefit
		- The Systems Transformation Repository/Library project is a DAO cell of the SuperBenefit DAO and will align with [SuperBenefit's ethos ](https://www.notion.so/superbenefit/SuperBenefit-s-Ethos-a1b3056c546e4ef1af9cc031a1fec0fa)(values, purpose and mission)

			- Crypto Culture & Society DAO (contacts: @Nate @MBaldwin @heenal) 
				- [Unsemester elective](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fbk_t7lYgT7CvbaBRnSFtIwNquovqHJ6vN-Ke8qz8Lg/edit) "web3 for better futures: transforming systems, sectors and institutions"
			- Forefront DAO (contact: @Nate)
		- The Systems Transformation DAO cell will reflect on the model and capture the learning and share with the DAO Primitive research team and other DAO cells.

			- @Nate deep synthesis and analysis of two systems transformation projects and DAOs to explore what has enabled and constrained them. Connect to Crypto Culture & Society (CCS)
			- @heenal connect to Crypto, Culture & Society workshop and elective; information and tooling systems
			- @swaddell frameworks/ synthesis/ analysis 
		- **Contributors **
			- @Lewwwk interested in discussions and framing related to systems transformation 
			- @rathermercurial skillset includes Github + Gitbook deployment, document standardization, templates, formatting, mass import, discoverability
			- @AlexH guidance on framing of purpose, discrete workshops or discussions, light touch
			- @Rowan DAO cell support and facilitation and governance set up
			- @njoki - participated in web3 systems transformation series, weekly meet ups 
			- @gaoa - participated in web3 systems transformation and co-working meet up
		- **TBC**
			- @Ashraful.Impactrio supports governance framework analysis and generation
			- @Peter Gulka synchronicities with Indigenous Knowledge Bank and possible future collaborations
	- ### Decision-making
		- To start with, decisions will be made in person in the weekly meeting doc and a-synch in the discord channel. Decision format - a consensus decision-making process

# Treasury - Michelle + Rowan
- ## Wallet 
	- Multi-sig set up in GnosisSafe on the Polygon network
	- many signers with 2-3 needed to to approve a transaction
	- Signers are:
		- @MBaldwin @heenal @Nate 
	- Starting budget 20,000 $SPRB - approved in snapshot vote - [https://snapshot.org/#/superbenefit.eth/proposal/0xac14863c9e78397efe863507044d1f56bcaaff636798a1a3b6c81d99200af81d](https://snapshot.org/#/superbenefit.eth/proposal/0xac14863c9e78397efe863507044d1f56bcaaff636798a1a3b6c81d99200af81d) 
- ## Financial record keeping
	- Dec 1 - safe created & 20,000 SPRB transferred to SystemsTransform
	- Dec 2 - 250 SPRB allocation to core team and 100 SPRB to contributors
- ## Rewarding contributors 
	- tbc - example below from the Primitives Project
		- We will allocate $SPRB 1k per core team at the start of the project. 
		- We will allocate micro-bounties to contributors via proposals in meetings/discord. 
		- We will run a coordinape at appropriate inflection points to allocate tokens to reward core contributors (we will ask for additional budget from SB to fund this if needed)
		- Rewarding contributors agreement - https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/d5fa17b4-5485-4636-9a7d-59e0b47a11b1

# Project Management
- ### Weekly team meeting
	- 45 mins weekly to sync up on progress and clear blocks
	- Tuesdays 4 pm EST via Zoom
- ### Revolutions
	- The project will be planned around sprint-style **mini-revolutions** (phases):
		- 0) DAO Cell outline
		- 1) Systems Transformation & web3 framework
		- 2) Research projects and DAOs aligned with the systems transformation framework
		- 3) Development of systems transformation repository tool
		- 4) Synthesis and analysis of what has enabled and constrained the systems transformation projects and DAOs.
- ### Task management 
	- Tasks will be recorded in [weekly team meeting notes](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/f166a619-b270-47a9-9579-8a71cc645f0e) and Discord conversations. They will be self-managed by individual contributors to begin with.
