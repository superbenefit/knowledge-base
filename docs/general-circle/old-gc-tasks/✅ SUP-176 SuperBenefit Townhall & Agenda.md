7:10 Purpose & Vision - Michael
- Began as a hunch - noticing new patterns in the crypto world as art and culture showing up as a driving force - that maybe there was a large implication than just the technology might suggest
- At the same time it was becoming increasingly clear that our insititions and systems were either unable or unwilling to act with the urgency that climate change and inequality demands.
- So a few of us began to go on some web3 adventure tours to see what was going on and what it might mean
- After 17, it became clear that there was something here, so we set to work trying to describe what we saw, what we might do about it, and prepare to welcome others to do something about it together.
- SuperBenefit’s purpose is to embed universal abundance into the core infrastructure of the future.
- For us, **universal abundance includes and requires** the interdependence and interplay of the following properties:
	- **Equitable access to opportunity, support, services, and resources.**
	- **Regenerative and distributive economies.**
	- **Self-determination, rights, and sovereignty of identity.**
	- **Care and conservation of all life, ecosystems, knowledge, and cultures.**
- More specifically, our mission is to develop the social and financial flywheels that enable invention, investment, and acceleration of a better world.
- Invitation 1: Mapping pathways to the future
- Invitation 2: Building capacity and interdependence through governance
- Invitation 3: Creating a soul-bound portal to a better future
- Invitation 4: A metacurrency for metagovernance, values, and acceleration
- Invitation 5: A commitment to bridging old into better
- Invitation 6: The look, feel, and story of a better future.
