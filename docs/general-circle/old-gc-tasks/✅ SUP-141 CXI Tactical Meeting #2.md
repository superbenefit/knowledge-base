	- Onboarding to SuperBenefit
		- Last Week: It feels a bit passive. I like the bot but it feels like we are missing the personal messages. feedback: not sure what I'm doing, what the onboarding process is, who's who. I got a much better idea at the Town Hall. Maybe an intro video would be helpful. Not sure what to look at, when you get in the channels it's very confusing.
		- Ideas
			- video intro to SB
			- FAQ in discord channel
			- weekly discord tutorial
			- email drip campaign
			- asking people to do simple things in the beginning. see Community Commitment Curve
		- This Week
			- troubleshoot Clarity with Jai
		- Blockers - feels impersonal, too much info across all channels
	- Community Resources Notion site
		- Last Week: Built out the Getting Started section
		- This Week: Build out the [Learning Pathways section](https://www.notion.so/superbenefit/web3-Learning-Pathways-3fe4f451524f46f5a7634d24cac59d15)
		- Blockers: Need support to organize web3 library better
	- Equity & Inclusion
		- Last Week: Attended "make web3 inclusive" and "web3 x social impact" Twitter spaces; started conversations with @questdao
		- This Week: Continue conversations, make a plan for a working group
		- Blockers: not sure how best to convene/coordinate a working group
	- Bounties
		- Last Week: Developed ideas for [bounties](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/pages/ac1d7416-39b7-4791-a8e9-c95ddbd84f06). Mike published a bounty!

### Tensions to Process
- Seek consensus on [Proposal to create new roles](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/work/120) 
- Lack of community engagement with ToC review process
- Discord roles/guilds still not updated
- Need support to organize the web3 library better ([see this note](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/0f13b3cf-ab8c-4177-8bb9-39b911445a59))
- Onboarding process for new members. Different tools are a lot to manage (not just a tech issue, although Clarity is challenging)
- Gatekeeping of Clarity 


### Closing Round
- The Facilitator invites each participant, one at a time, to share a closing reflection. No discussion.

# Tactical Meetings

Tactical meetings are focused on a team’s operational work. Their purpose is to triage issues that have come up recently and remove obstacles so that the work can move forward. (See: [https://www.holacracy.org/tactical-meetings](https://www.holacracy.org/tactical-meetings) ). They are not the meetings where the work itself gets done. We are focused on the most efficient way for the work to get unblocked.
Tactical Meetings for the #general circle happen on a weekly basis. (Regular day/time TBD)
Tactical Meetings need a secretary (scribe) and a facilitator. All Circle members are invited to participate.
## Tactical Meeting Process
### Checkin Round
- The Facilitator invites participants, one at a time, to share a check-in to call out distractions and get present. No discussion.

### Surface Data
- **Checklist Items**: Recurring actions that require a status of "Check" or "No check" from each relevant role from the preceding period.
- **Metrics Review:** Roles assigned to report on a metric share the latest data. Clarifying questions only, no discussion.
- **Project Updates:** Facilitator goes through each project and asks for updates. The project owner responds with "no update" or shares what has changed since the last meeting.
	- Optional Project Update Structure:
		- **Last Week** - what was completed
		- **This Week** - what is to be completed
		- **Blockers** - an obstacle that needs to be addressed (usually identified as a tension to be triaged)
	- A Circle Member can also ask a project owner for a projection of completion of a project as a tension.

### Remove Barriers
- **Build Agenda:** Participants build the agenda of tensions to process, using one or two words per item as a reminder for the agenda-item-owner.
- **Triage Items:**
	- The tension holder shares their tension.
	- Facilitator asks "What do you need to move your tension forward?"
		- Request for something to get something done (an action or a project)
		- Request data or advice
		- Request for attention to share information
		- Request for an ongoing expectation (governance change or agreement)
	- Secretary (scribe) captures accepted next-actions or projects

### Closing Round
- The Facilitator invites each participant, one at a time, to share a closing reflection. No discussion.
