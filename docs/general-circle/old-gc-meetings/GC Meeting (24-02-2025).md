## Discussion Topics

- Boann Conversation

  - [D. Social Finance pattern draft/example](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/social-finance-pattern-3561806556570828)

  - biggest gap in social finance - there is no blended finance, pooled capital, for successful social finance ecosystem to grow need Social Finance Fund in Canada but lack of pool of blended finance to be more catalytic. 

  - Philanthropy not engaging in blended finance pool. 

  - We could help sector be the concessionary capital in the sector. 

  - Work in coordination with the Social Finance Fund wholesalers, we could consider deals they feel are too high risk

  - Tech side would be another area of potential focus

  - Boann coming back to impact - not receptive to just understanding the model of how yield gets generated 

    - brings philanthropic organization on chain

    - SuperBenefit role to have folks thinks about how to use resources to shift power and for useful things and the how

    - Conservation Impact Bond - https://caroliniancanada.ca/cib

    - Partner with bioregional community that might be amenable to using onchain approaches and metrics

    - yield generation is about unlocking idle capital, to redirect those towards impact - the amount to impact is low compared to what is unlocked, 10M unlocked but that is generating 10% yield but it looks skewed and it is slow moving compared to the sticker amount

      - cornerstone for introducing crypto native financing as a backbone, could be realm opportunity for blended finance

      - the impact side won't be easy

    - Possibility of reversing the process and having funders put capital into a yield fund that can support a single specific projectOther approach - describe as mini yield funds around existing projects, give existing supporters opportunity to support another way - reverse way to look at it

    - taking existing endowment resources that are for endowment only and we do it onchain, giving them the experience, can deliver similar risk profile but can provide higher return yield because onchain - part of the education process is to help them to understand the risks and smart contracts

    - your dollars that are in low risk, excess yield and we pool that for research and for emerging tech - use that excess yield in experimental ways with your portfolio of funds

    - Boann - not being philanthropic, what does this mean? 

      - short term opportunity for a few years, to test onchain finance models

        - forward thinking foundation that is open to this

    - Ethereum Localism - Scott Morris consult, community driven innovation networks, they published and harvest that back in - work into the social finance pattern

    - What is simplest way to deal with the old school capital, how can capture some of the resources and use it as a wedge

    - Blended Finance Summit - more practical, lessons learned in UK - second year of summit and still nothing has emerged in Canada, collaborative inaction 

      - SFF - technically has to give money back - they have targets, and pay for operation

      - Blended Finance - to come from the capital that has ability to be patient e.g. foundations - pooling their capital, taking the lowest percentage, encourages other investors to come in 

        - decision making - lots of time on committees, and involving the community

        - on blockchain would be transparent and remarkable

        - Example well referenced - 

 https://bostonimpact.org/

        - Innovative practices and capital transfers 

 https://www.mcconnellfoundation.ca/report/innovative-practices-in-grantmaking-and-capital-transfers/

 

Null funds - community decides how to choose to distribute the capital - spend down - Ivey Foundation 

- Perhaps we create our own pool of blended finance capital that comes out of the yield fund. This way it can distribute to all of the riskiest opportunities in the social finance space (satisfying BOANN's need to fund orgs that will distribute funds).
