## Updates

	- Michelle & Heenal met with Sue Snider to get her up to speed on the project. She is interested in leveraging funding and potentially bringing more people on board. She asked about role of AI.
	- Menzies Foundation - clarifying the purpose and scope of the work together
	- Stakeholder partnership email almost ready to send out
- #[P-261 Windfall - Residential Energy NFT](P-261%20Windfall%20-%20Residential%20Energy%20NFT)
	- Blockscience is coming up to speed (I underestimated how much it will take to get them up to speed on the topic - result though will be useful for getting others onboarded)
	- Core community infrastructure is in place
		- will need resources from above (onboarding blockscience) to invite community
		- next up is digging into community incentive model and rallying community grant fund
	- Contracting just waiting for signify
- #[community experience squad](archive/clarity/Tags/community%20experience%20squad.md) 
	- Tidying up on Discord channels, welcome message, FAQ
	- Conversation with Aditi, thinking about onboarding into the space and into SB.
		- A podcast list could be helpful.
	- 

## Discussion topics
- Windfall in RPP Stakeholder group?
	- Keep the cells and stakeholder groups separate and encourage inter-cell collaboration as and when it makes sense for them to do so. Look at ways to facilitate knowledge transfer between projects and as broader SB knowledge sharing.
- Clarity is winding down. Need alternatives and migration plan for:
	- Task Management - Possibly [Dework](https://dework.xyz/) or Wonderverse - looking for a web3 tool that can be the main SB project management. Then Cells/teams can choose their own tooling as they decide. 
		- Any web3 tool will have a good chance of being shutdown in the next 6 months. So we will need find something that we can move away from if this happens. 
	- Wiki/Community Docs
	- options are all risky. project management is important - more than just a kanban board. how would documentation and project management system be connected? it's a lot of work, so let's be intentional with our choices. Cells won't be locked in to a particular platform for their internal needs.
		- semi-permanent info to be stored on gitbook.
		- ideas - charmverse, fileverse, notion. Dework or Wonder for PM.
	- let's document some guiding principles for what tooling to choose. accessible/good UX, resilient/durable, etc.
- Rev 1 - initial allocation proposal
- Bridging infra for normie institutions into decentralized vehicles (ML)
