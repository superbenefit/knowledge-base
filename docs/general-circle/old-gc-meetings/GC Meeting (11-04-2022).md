## Triage Items
- What tensions do you have that need resolution to move forward in your work?
	- How do we think about amounts for $SPRB allocations (Rowan)
		- As a rough framing, think of each $SPRB as $1 
		- Try some micro-bounties with smaller amounts. No need to go to Snapshot for these
	- Krause House (Heenal)
		- Heenal go ahead in KH and feel free to use any SB materials
		- Michael leading DIO project, too
	- Discussion about research project
		- #[232 Think about writing an article about "entity thinking" ](232%20Think%20about%20writing%20an%20article%20about%20"entity%20thinking"%20) and associated - the sooner and smaller this is, the better
	- Setting up wallets for projects 
		- The pattern: Project lead spins up a Gnosis multisig wallet on Polygon chain. Then Treasury funds the wallet.
		- Snapshot is optional for each project
