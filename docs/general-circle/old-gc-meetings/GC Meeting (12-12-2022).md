## Checkout
- What else do you need to feel heard or complete for this call?


**Anonymity/Equity**
-rather than a single space and rules for everyone to show up as needed
-permeable,don't need rules, consciousness that creates container that is collective, mini containers
-async and connected environments without breaking rythym
-more granularity and complexity 
-how to hold people accountable when under anonymity and cause harm and address when it is the mechanism to perpetuate systems of oppression 
-design for those who have most disadvantaged by the system 
-interoperability of how to approach design in a way that allows anonymity 
-thinking around DAO cell has some similarities, because the collective designs and the network does not define what it will be but what are the primitives and you don't want those who get their first to design, how to consciously construct the structure and shift over time 

**Njoki reflections**
How to navigate lack of consensus in DAOs
If agree on things and in channels - not sure what happens when lack of consensus on major decisions and navigate conflict
- debate around ethereum improvement proposal -and on twitter played out and it was thoughtful commentary on twitter between parties, and this was governance, governance is conversations happening in public - in community, in Discord, on Twitter
- disagreement is healthy 
- those who care about governance enable good discourse at minimum
- forking is okay and if happens how do you not lose all the resources, moloch DAO works for liquid assets 
- how to think about consensus - everything comes back when design (see below) - design for different scales we need, may be collaboration scale and having discussion at broadcast scale

- Sparked for transformation team at community foundations of canada to use a DAO cell model 

Sustainability of DAOs - how many last, what is impact
- and timing length may not indicate impact
- is this a time of more pulsing and more about networks and less about a sustainability of a node and more about a movement and network
