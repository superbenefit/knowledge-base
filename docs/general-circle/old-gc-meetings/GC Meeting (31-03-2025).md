  - Love football experiment scoping opportunity is looking good. Chiliz (blockchain) they have all the big football fan tokens. They are interested in contribute funding a gatherings programme

  - Aiming to get an application in to Chiliz in the next week

- Concept of infrastructure services - using LLMs to extract and compose some data and then make it available to a community via an API as a node. Protecting the community against the technical and risk costs involved in doing it themselves. Knowledge and AI as a service. E.g refine the knowledge base at SB and develop one of these. There is now a known path to deploying one of these things. 

  - Create an LLM that has access to the knowledge base as a data set via an API. Then make this accessible to other LLMs and agents. Then when a bot accesses the data it can be really simple because the LLM does the hard work. But the LLM itself can be really accurate and low power as a local opensource model with access to the specific data

  - The first steps for the SB knowledge base 

    - Refine the lexicon (to reduce the hallucinations made by the model). This creates the big accuracy and efficiency gains
