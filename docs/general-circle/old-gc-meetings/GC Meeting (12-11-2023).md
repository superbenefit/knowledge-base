# Meeting Agenda

## Check-In

- 

## Updates

- RPP (Heenal)

  - OTF funding received!!! (30k CAD)

  - KYC process with Newton has stalled. Have begun KYC process with Gemini as an alternative (but it seems US-centric)

    - **Any suggestions for an alternative (Canadian, nonprofit-friendly (or at least corporation-friendly)) fiat onramp? Shakepay??**  any insight on this

  - Stakeholder agenda drafted by Filsan, Heenal and Michelle  

    - Maybe be good to distinguish between traditional governance and web3 (meta)governance:

      - trad. Governance: Constraining the behavior of people

      - web3 Metagovernance: Co-creating the coordination mechanisms people use

- rather started auditing polices and will start on agreements next, creating a DAO state for SB

  - three policies and may need to do a round up and dig through if we had defined policies in other places

  - discussion on what is needed

- Restorying Power -  restorying power is a loose group of people who are testing something together and not a cell as of yet for RPP or SB.

  - not formal cell team, folks are individually accountable to the DAO for their own actions but when a cell everyone is mutually accountable to the cell and to one another

  - DAO primitive has some disambiguation and a cell has a cell state but we have squads or working groups or some other naming convention but they are a cell  ad

- Menzies Foundation - confirmed for 25K for exploring web3 financing options - introduction meeting with Ian Bird, Community Foundations of Australia

  - who were NZ connections for community foundations for Australia
