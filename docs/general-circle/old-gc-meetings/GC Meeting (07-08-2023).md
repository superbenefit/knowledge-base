## Triage/Discussion
- cell core team
	- what are the rights AND responsibilities of being in the core team?
	- what skillsets are needed?
	- who gets to decide?
		- For the Windfall proposal (and moving forwards?), list the initial core team members in the Proposal
	- spend some of first meeting time:
		- going through the cell state
		- getting clear on roles, responsibilities, rewards
			- There is space for these in the Cell Planning Doc: [https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/project/267](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/project/267)
