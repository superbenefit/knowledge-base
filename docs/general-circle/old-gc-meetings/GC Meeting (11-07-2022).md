## Triage Items
- What tensions do you have that need resolution to move forward in your work?
	- Communications still would be helpful - MB
		- narrative on mission rather than promotion, translate work back into narrative, keep linkage alive
	- Confirm that it's ok to distribute tokens without Treasury input (Heenal)
	- Recurring events in Discord, how to do it
	- Clarity public bases - would we be interested in this?
	- Systems focus not impact focus  - abandon comfort, entity, philanthropic thinking 
		- scale and how can impact connection, culture, conflict
