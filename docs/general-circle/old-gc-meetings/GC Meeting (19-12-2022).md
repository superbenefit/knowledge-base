Impact as counterpoint to business and when bring this in creates a dichotomy and bringing this in does this make assumption business does not or should not do good
Do DAOs have meaning now or have they lost something because coming from old models and just tweaking them
what tools can uniquely enable, what is that form of organization best applied to - that is unique to this space, but rushing to make sense of it is leading to old models
how decentralized is it, the fluidity is important, can we look at this in our analysis of projects
the ability to work with smaller functional units, the architecture that is needed is a purpose 
everything has a purpose - differentiate types of purpose in crude ways 
- Impact DAO - we are organizing some sort of public or community benefit, public value rather than private interest
- Transformation DAO - change the nature of a system - typology - here are some categories as we understand them

flexibility lets us to be more effective because don't have as much of the friction, have to deliberately design to do something 
more where we are start - cultural context - what motivates people to do things is unanchored that we have to differentiate that it is for common sense and decency and call it out as distinct - assumption that everything that is built on principles that underpinned by common values of being in the world - the fact that we have to differentiate
