### Triage

	

  - Created demo versions of a [governance state](https://sb-flowershow-instance.vercel.app/) and [knowledge garden](https://sb-garden-test.rathermercurial.xyz/artifacts/Building-DAOs-as-scalable-networks). Are these useful / should they be developed further? (rather)

    - governance state - flowershow - more structured data - policies & proposals - only governance team could publish

    - knowledge garden - quartz - obsidian backend. still use CV for collaboration and co-crafting documents. then when artifacts are ready to publish, export to markdown and then there's some automated + some manual processes to bring the markdown files into obsidian appropriately
