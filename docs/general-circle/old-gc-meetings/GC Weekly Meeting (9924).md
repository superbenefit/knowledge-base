## Discussion Topics

- Work with AI

  - Michelle is seeing a lot of interest in AI in the philanthropy sector and many opportunities for funding

  - Interest in making AI better, removing bias etc

  - Is there a way that we can collaborate in this domain? AI could be the gateway for talking about emerging technologies

  - equity comes from people having ownership and control of what they create

- AIFS/SB Community Experience and RPP Social Impact/Onboarding Calls - what is needed, how to distinguish, do we need them ongoing

  - Social Impact/Onboarding calls could wrap up soon once those workstream deliverables are completed. Onboarding will become part of CX work. Need to clarify roles in the workflow - CX/onboarding, buddy - when does the buddy take over?

  - AIFS/SB CX calls will become even more important to continue as we get moving on the Gatherings - there will soon be more work for CX than there has been recently. Let's consider scheduling a regular weekly or bi-weekly meeting rather than setting times ad hoc.

- How are we approaching roles and supporting policies (advice/consent, coordination expectations, etc)?

  - Review [previous advice process](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/role-advice-process-rap-5791647383219427) & consider the Hats advice process, too (rather will share)
