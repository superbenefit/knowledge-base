# Meeting Agenda

## Discussion Topics

- Legal entity conversation (rowan)

  - $4500 start up fee

  - Includes some sessions with Adam (consultant) to work through what we need to do to get this done

  - If we do this now and have under 30k in treasury it is 4.5k in fees. If it is more that that the it is 2k more. 

  - We need to have an operating agreement on file - we can create and pass this ourselves (rather than getting a lawyer to do it for us) we can do this as part of redoing out governance at SB. We can use a template and then we can abstract most of the governance info into governance state

  - We should fall into their guidelines as a non profit DAO - this means that we will pay 0% tax. If not then a 3% tax rate. 

  - Aim to get the legal entity set up asap for clarity and storytelling potential 

  - We can do a soft registration - to reserve the registration and then get the paperwork finished 

- Any support needed for new cells / workstreams (yield fund, IFP, AIFS, Value Flows)?

  - Yield fund group - conversation phase

  - ICS / Greenpill London - conversation phase

  - Value flows workstream - conversation phase

  - AIFS - proposal to formalise operational governance and bring in and AIFS cell - formation phase

  - IFP - conversation phase

  - Rowan is working on a diagram of SB's structure and functions. We can expand on that to better clarify what services and resources SB provides
