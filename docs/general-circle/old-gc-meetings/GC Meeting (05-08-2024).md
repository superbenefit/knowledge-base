  - AIFS, OTF, SB, ReadySport, Women Win, HuddleCraft (works with OTF to support their fundees)

## Discussion Topics

- We need to work on community experience cell and confirm roles, multisig (+ signers), funds to get things done. 

- The community experience cell can hold the community weaver role 

- We need to put up an RFP for the community weaver role

- If we can have the community weaver role defined and hopefully filled by the stakeholder call in late august 

- The community experience cell doesn't need to do a lot of delivery. Just be enough people with enough context to make good decisions.
