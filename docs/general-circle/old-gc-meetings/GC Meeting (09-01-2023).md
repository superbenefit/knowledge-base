Rough Notes:

-it is the decentralized technologies that uniquely enable that was not possible before
-not abou DAOs
-not what doing but what about learning
practice based evidence rather than evidence based practice 
-Northpine - if they go for it, paradigm shift and community to figure it out with technologies and practices
-telling vs showing
-embracing of complexity and systems 
-specificity - conditions that foster change
-enablers of fundamental shifts
-nonprofit is working in current economic system, new tools allow for a new economic system
-DAOs most relatable because like an organization
-
-degree of shift rather than scale
