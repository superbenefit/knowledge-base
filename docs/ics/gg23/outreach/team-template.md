# Team Mobilization for GG23 Campaign

This document provides templates and guidance for mobilizing your team members to amplify the campaign's reach.

## Request to Team Members Template

```
Hello ICS team!

As you know, we're participating in Gitcoin Grants Round 23 which runs until April 16th. We have a great opportunity to secure matching funds based on the number of unique donors we attract.

I'd like to ask each of you to help by:

1. Making a small donation yourself if possible (even $1 helps significantly with the matching!)
2. Reaching out to 3-5 personal contacts who might support our work
3. Sharing our campaign on your social media

Here's everything you need:

DONATION LINK: https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/31/52

WHAT WE'RE FUNDING: This campaign supports our work bridging local sustainability initiatives (Repair Café, Thing Library) with web3 regenerative tools. We're documenting patterns for replication and contribution to the knowledge commons.

SUGGESTED MESSAGE TO CONTACTS:
"Hi [Name], I'm helping with the Institute for Community Sustainability's Gitcoin Grants application. We're building bridges between local sustainability work and regenerative finance. Even a $1 donation helps significantly with matching funds! If you'd like to support: https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/31/52"

Thank you for your help! Please let me know if you have any questions.

## Tracking Sheet for Team Mobilization

Consider creating a simple spreadsheet or table where team members can track their outreach:

| Team Member | Personal Donation | # Contacts Reached | # Donations Secured | Social Media Shared |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| [Name 1]    | Yes/No            | [number]           | [number]           | Yes/No              |
| [Name 2]    | Yes/No            | [number]           | [number]           | Yes/No              |
| [Name 3]    | Yes/No            | [number]           | [number]           | Yes/No              |

## Tips for Effective Team Mobilization

### 1. Make it Simple
- Provide everything they need in one place
- Create templates they can copy and paste
- Set clear, achievable expectations (e.g., "reach out to 3-5 people")

### 2. Create Accountability
- Set up a tracking system (like the table above)
- Schedule a quick check-in halfway through the campaign
- Celebrate and acknowledge contributions

### 3. Provide Support
- Offer to answer any questions about web3/Gitcoin for their contacts
- Be available to troubleshoot any issues
- Send reminders without being pushy

### 4. Show Gratitude
- Thank team members individually for their help
- Acknowledge their contributions in team meetings
- Share the final results and impact of their efforts
