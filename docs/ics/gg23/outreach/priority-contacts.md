## Contact Strategy

### Day 1
- Contact all Tier 1 individuals (5-7 people)
- Prioritize those with high Web3 familiarity first

### Day 2
- Follow up with any Tier 1 contacts who haven't responded
- Begin contacting Tier 2 individuals (5-7 people)
- Ask Tier 1 donors to share with their networks

### Day 3
- Final follow-ups with Tier 1 and 2 contacts
- Contact remaining Tier 2 and select Tier 3 individuals
- Send thank you messages to all donors

## Tips for Populating This List
1. Start with your team members and closest collaborators
2. Add people you've worked with directly on ICS projects
3. Include contacts from SuperBenefit, GreenPill, and other web3 communities
4. Consider supporters of the Repair Café and Thing Library
5. Think about friends and family who support your work, even if they're not familiar with web3

Remember: It's better to have focused, meaningful conversations with a smaller number of potential supporters than to send generic messages to many people.
