The Institute for Community Sustainability is in @GitcoinGrants Round 23! 🌱

We're building bridges between local sustainability work and global regenerative finance coordination.

Here's why this matters and how you can help: 🧵👇

ICS has a vision of radical sustainability and community resilience:

Our Repair Café has diverted 1,000+ kg from landfill this year alone, and our Thing Library has saved community members $14,000+ through shared resources.
```

### Tweet 3
```
But we're doing something even more powerful - documenting patterns for other communities while exploring how web3 tools can amplify local impact.

We're part of the Reimagining Power Project (@superbenefit), exploring how blockchain enables community ownership and governance.
```

### Tweet 4
```
We've successfully bridged $140,000 from traditional philanthropy into web3 and are launching a @greenpill_gp chapter in London, Ontario.

Our goal: create living examples of how local sustainability initiatives can integrate with global regenerative networks.
```

### Tweet 5
```
We're contributing to a global knowledge commons through:

• Open-source playbooks for community sustainability
• Experiments with on-chain impact verification
• Prototypes of decentralized governance for local projects
```

Through @GitcoinGrants Round 23, we're seeking support to continue this bridge-building work.

The beauty of quadratic funding: even small donations significantly boost our matching funds.

Friends, I need your help! The Institute for Community Sustainability is participating in a special funding round that makes SMALL donations incredibly powerful.

A brief thread on what we're doing and why your support matters:👇 #GG23

You might know about our Repair Café where volunteers fix broken items for free (1,000+ kg diverted from landfill!) and our Thing Library where people can borrow tools instead of buying them.

These programs build community resilience while reducing waste.
```

### Tweet 3
```
We're now learning how new technologies can help scale these initiatives. We're creating step-by-step guides for other communities and exploring tools that make it easier to coordinate community programs.
```

```
Here's the cool part: we're participating in something called "quadratic funding" where the NUMBER of supporters matters more than the amount.

Even a $1 donation significantly improves our matching funding! Learn more: wtfisqf.com

## Thread 3: Ethereum Localism Focus

### Tweet 1
```
Ethereum Localism represents a powerful vision: using web3 tools to strengthen local communities while connecting them globally.

@ICS_London is actively contributing to this movement. Here's how: 🧵👇

#GG23 #EthereumLocalism
```

### Tweet 2
```
We participated in the General Forum on Ethereum Localism (GFEL) and co-sponsored the General Forum on Arts Localism (GFAL) in London, Ontario.

These gatherings brought together artists, builders, and community members to explore how web3 can strengthen local cultural ecosystems.
```

### Tweet 3
```
We're implementing practical Ethereum Localism through:

• On-chain governance for our Repair Café and Thing Library
• Impact verification for community sustainability initiatives
• Establishing a Green Pill Network local chapter
• Building bridges between traditional organizations and web3
```

### Tweet 4
```
We're developing open-source playbooks for the commons, including:

• Community Sustainability DAO Governance
• Bridging Traditional Funding to Web3
• Impact Verification for Local Initiatives
• Onboarding Community Members to Web3
```

### Tweet 5
```
Our work directly supports Ethereum Localism by providing real-world examples and documentation of how web3 tools can enhance place-based community building.

We're creating a template that other local initiatives can adapt and implement.
```

### Tweet 6

If you believe in Ethereum Localism and the power of web3 to strengthen communities, please support our work in @GitcoinGrants Round 23.

Even small donations significantly improve our matching: https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/31/52

## Thread 4: Personal Appeal Thread

### Tweet 1
```
I've spent the last 6 years building community sustainability initiatives in London, Ontario - starting with a small package-free store that grew into repair cafés, a tool library, and a vibrant hub for sustainable living.

A brief personal thread about why your support matters: 🧵 #GG23
```

### Tweet 2
```
Through countless volunteer hours, community generosity, and a deep belief that we can build better systems together, we've created tangible alternatives to our throwaway economy.

Each repaired item, each borrowed tool represents a small act of resistance and hope.
```

### Tweet 3
```
When I discovered the web3 space in 2021, I saw incredible potential to scale this work through better coordination, transparent governance, and new economic models.

Despite being a very small team, we've been building bridges between these worlds ever since.
```

### Tweet 4
```
It hasn't been easy. We've navigated the challenges of being a traditional non-profit exploring decentralized technologies, of explaining web3 to sustainability advocates and sustainability to web3 builders.

But the potential for impact keeps us going.
```

### Tweet 5
```
This is our first @GitcoinGrants round - a milestone in our journey to connect our local sustainability work with global regenerative networks.

After thousands of hours of volunteer work, your support would mean the world to us.
```

The beauty of quadratic funding is that even a $1 donation significantly improves our matching funds.
