# Twitter Threads for Transformative Impact Focus

These threads emphasize the broader, systemic change potential of your work rather than just the immediate programs. They draw from your conversations with family and focus on Ethereum Localism and long-term transformation.

## Thread 1: Ethereum Localism Focus

### Tweet 1
```
We're participating in @GitcoinGrants Round 23! 🌱

But what is our work actually about? It's not just a Repair Café and Thing Library - we're building foundations for Ethereum Localism and community-owned infrastructure.

A thread on what this means and why it matters: 🧵👇

#GG23
```

### Tweet 2
```
"Ethereum Localism" means communities maintain sovereignty over their data, resources, and governance while connecting to global networks.

It's about ensuring the benefits of technology serve people directly, rather than extracting value from them.
```

### Tweet 3
```
We've already introduced five charitable foundations to blockchain-based funding models that will transform how MILLIONS in community funding gets allocated.

This shifts power from traditional gatekeepers to historically underfunded grassroots initiatives.
```

### Tweet 4
```
One key project: We're developing a local mutual credit system enabling community members to exchange services without cash.

This creates resilience during economic downturns and makes skills/support accessible to those with limited financial resources.
```

### Tweet 5
```
We're also building an impact attestation system for grassroots climate initiatives to document their environmental benefits on-chain.

This creates verifiable evidence that can unlock new funding sources from climate-focused supporters.
```

### Tweet 6
```
Our playbooks document everything we learn - from DAO governance to community funding rounds to impact tracking systems.

This enables other cities to implement similar initiatives without starting from scratch.
```

### Tweet 7
```
This funding supports the transition from R&D to real-world pilots. It covers:

• Web3 community meetups
• Contributor compensation
• Pattern and playbook development
• Seeding local mutual credit systems

## Thread 2: Explaining Our Work to Non-Web3 Audiences

### Tweet 1
```
We're in @GitcoinGrants Round 23 and even a $2 donation makes a huge difference!

If you've ever wondered what we're working on beyond Repair Cafés and Thing Libraries, here's the bigger picture: 🧵👇

Non-crypto folks can donate here: [PAYPAL LINK]
```

### Tweet 2
```
We're designing and testing models for how communities can govern their own resources, make funding decisions transparently, and document their impact.

Think of it as R&D for more equitable, transparent systems that communities around the world can implement.
```

### Tweet 3
```
One concrete example: We've helped major charitable foundations experiment with new models that could transform how millions in community funding gets allocated.

This means more resources directed to grassroots initiatives that traditional systems overlook.
```

### Tweet 4
```
Another example: We're developing a system where community members can exchange skills and support without cash. 

Need childcare but short on money? Your graphic design skills or home repair knowledge becomes currency in the community.
```

### Tweet 5
```
We document everything we learn in open-source playbooks so other communities don't have to start from scratch.

We're creating templates for Tool Libraries, Repair Cafés, community funding, and transparent governance that anyone can implement.
```

### Tweet 6
```
This isn't theoretical - organizations beyond London are already adopting our models for community-governed resource allocation.

Every donation, even just $2, helps us expand this impact.

## Thread 3: Family-Style Personal Appeal

### Tweet 1
```
I've been grinding away in web3 for 4 years now, and things are finally coming together. 

Our organization has been accepted into @GitcoinGrants "Regen Coordination" round - a prestigious recognition of our work.

A quick thread on why this matters: 🧵
```

### Tweet 2
```
The Institute for Community Sustainability is experimenting with bridging web3 tools and on-the-ground community action.

We're moving from R&D into real pilots that will transform how resources flow to communities.
```

### Tweet 3
```
We're designing systems where communities - not corporations or governments - control their own data, resources, and decision-making while connecting to global support networks.

This is what a more equitable, transparent future looks like.
```

### Tweet 4
```
This funding round uses "quadratic funding" where the NUMBER of contributors matters more than the amount.

That means even a $1-2 donation significantly boosts our matching funds from the $96,000 pool.

```

### Tweet 5
```
The funds will support:
• Community meetups and education
• Pilot projects in community-directed funding
• Local mutual credit and skill-sharing systems
• Documentation so others can replicate our work

Every small donation helps tremendously.
```

### Tweet 6
```
This is our first time being included in a web3 funding round. Your support means the world to me personally and to our work.

Thank you! 💚

## Thread 4: Transformative Future-Focused Appeal

### Tweet 1
```
What if communities directly controlled their resources rather than depending on external institutions?

Our @GitcoinGrants application explores exactly this. A thread on the future we're building: 🧵👇

#GG23
```

### Tweet 2
```
We're creating systems where:

• Communities maintain sovereignty over their data and resources
• Funding decisions happen transparently, not behind closed doors
• Impact can be verified on-chain, creating trust without centralized authorities
```

### Tweet 3
```
Through our Greenpill London chapter, we're connecting local sustainability work to global regenerative networks.

This isn't just about fixing things and sharing tools - it's about fundamentally transforming how communities coordinate resources.
```

### Tweet 4
```
We're testing community-directed basic income experiments where targeted resource flows can support care work, artistic creation, and other historically undervalued contributions.

This expands what's considered "valuable work" beyond traditional employment.
```

### Tweet 5
```
Our model for community-governed resource libraries is being adopted by organizations beyond London.

We're building infrastructure to help other communities implement similar systems without starting from scratch.
```

### Tweet 6
```
This funding helps us move from designing systems to implementing them in the real world.

Your support - even just $1-2 - makes a significant difference thanks to quadratic funding.
