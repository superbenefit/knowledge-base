## The Streamlined Approach - Key Points

### 1. Focus on Personal Outreach (Highest ROI)
Begin with your closest contacts - people who know and trust you. Even if they're not familiar with web3, they'll support *you*. Personal messages convert at 5-10x the rate of group posts.

### 2. Emphasize Your Unique Bridge Position
ICS's strength is bridging tangible local sustainability (Repair Café, Thing Library) with web3 coordination tools. This makes you uniquely positioned in the Regen Coordination category.

### 3. Make It Simple for People to Support
Explain that even $1 helps significantly with the matching calculation. Remove friction by providing direct links and clear instructions.

### 4. Quality Over Quantity
Rather than trying to post in every possible community, focus on 3-5 groups where you already have relationships and credibility.

## Implementation Timeline

### Day 1 (Today)
1. **First hour**: Review and customize the core narrative in `outreach/core-narrative.md`
2. **Second hour**: Identify 5-10 close allies using `outreach/priority-contacts.md`
3. **Third hour**: Send personal messages using templates in `outreach/personal-templates.md`

### Day 2
1. **First hour**: Post in 2-3 key Telegram groups using templates in `outreach/community-groups.md`
2. **Second hour**: Mobilize your team using templates in `outreach/team-template.md`
3. **Third hour**: Share progress update on social media using templates in `tweets/core-tweets.md`

### Day 3
1. **First hour**: Follow up with interested but uncommitted supporters
2. **Second hour**: Post final appeals in all channels
3. **Third hour**: Begin preparing thank you messages for afterwards

## Remember What Matters Most

1. **Authentic communication** wins over polished marketing
2. **Personal requests** convert better than broadcast messages
3. **A focused effort** in a few channels beats scattered presence in many
4. **Your passion for the work** is your most compelling asset

The templates provided are designed to be simple starting points. Customize them with your authentic voice and personal connection to the work.
