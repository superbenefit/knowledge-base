Friends, I need your help with something important to me! 💚

The Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) – the non-profit I lead that runs the London Repair Café and Thing Library – is participating in Gitcoin Grants Round 23, a special funding opportunity that makes small donations incredibly powerful.

Why this matters:
• Our Repair Café has diverted over 1,000kg from landfill this year alone
• Our Thing Library has saved the community $14,000+ by sharing resources
• We're building bridges between local sustainability and global regenerative networks

Here's the cool part: This funding round uses something called "quadratic funding" where the NUMBER of people who donate matters more than the amount. Even a $1 donation significantly improves our matching funds!

You can support us in two ways:
1) Through Gitcoin (if you're comfortable with crypto): https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/31/52
2) Through PayPal (easier for most): [YOUR PAYPAL LINK]

Not familiar with quadratic funding? Check out wtfisqf.com for a simple explanation of why small donations are so powerful in this model.

Thank you for considering this! After 6 years of building community sustainability initiatives, often with limited resources, your support would mean the world to me and our small team. ❤️

Questions? I'm happy to explain more about our work or how this funding works!
