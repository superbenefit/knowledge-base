# Updated GG23 Campaign Strategy - Additional Elements

This document supplements the master execution plan with additional strategies and tactics based on your latest requests.

## Farcaster Strategy

Farcaster is a growing decentralized social network with a highly engaged web3-native audience. While your reach there may be smaller than Twitter/X, the conversion rate is likely to be higher due to the alignment with your mission.

### Farcaster Content Strategy
- **Allocation**: Dedicate approximately 20% of your social media time to Farcaster
- **Cross-posting**: Adapt your best-performing Twitter content for Farcaster
- **Native features**: Take advantage of Farcaster-specific features like channels and frames

### Recommended Farcaster Actions

1. **Join Relevant Channels**:
   - `#regen` - For regenerative finance discussions
   - `#gitcoin` - For GG23-specific conversations
   - `#ethereum` - For broader Ethereum community engagement
   - `#climate` - For sustainability discussions

2. **Daily Posts**:
   - **Day 1**: Introduction cast announcing your GG23 participation
   - **Day 2**: Impact metrics cast (Repair Café and Thing Library stats)
   - **Day 3**: Final day push with urgency

3. **Engagement Strategy**:
   - Reply to GG23-related casts from others
   - Engage with comments on your casts promptly
   - Cast about other projects you're supporting in GG23

4. **Farcaster-Specific Content**:
   - Create a frame that links directly to your donation page (especially effective on Farcaster)
   - Use Farcaster's reply-to-join channel feature for Q&A about your project

## Poetic Campaign Element

As a poet, you can leverage your creative talents to make your campaign stand out memorably. The poem will be a centerpiece of Day 2 promotion.

### Poetry Strategy

1. **Create the Poem (Day 1)**:
   - Focus on themes of bridges between local action and global coordination
   - Incorporate imagery from both physical sustainability work and digital regeneration
   - Keep it to 10-20 lines for social media sharing

2. **Deployment (Day 2)**:
   - **Primary push**: Share across all platforms with consistent formatting
   - **Video version**: Record yourself reading the poem for increased engagement
   - **Visual version**: Create a simple graphic with the poem text for Instagram/Facebook

3. **Distribution Channels**:
   - Twitter/X (primary thread + individual stanza tweets)
   - Farcaster (full poem in one cast)
   - Instagram (as a carousel post with each slide containing one stanza)
   - Facebook (full poem with your reading linked)
   - Email newsletter (featured content)
   - Telegram groups (as a unique contribution)

4. **Engagement Strategy**:
   - Ask community members to share which lines resonated most with them
   - Create a unique hashtag for the poem (e.g., #BridgingWorldsPoem)
   - Offer to write personalized poetic thank-yous to major donors or amplifiers

## Additional Campaign Actions

### Twitter Engagement
- **Follow everyone** who has tweeted about GG23 or is participating in the round
- **@mention and DM** key supporters, especially those who have engaged with your content
- **Create a private Twitter list** of potential supporters to monitor and engage with

### Twitter Spaces Strategy
1. **Create a list of relevant Twitter Spaces**:
   - Search for scheduled Spaces discussing GG23, Gitcoin, public goods
   - Note times, hosts, and expected audience
   - Prioritize by alignment with your work

2. **Participation approach**:
   - Join as a listener first, request to speak when relevant
   - Prepare a concise 30-second pitch about your project
   - When speaking, focus on unique aspects (bridging local-global, knowledge commons)
   - Always mention that small donations significantly help through QF
   - Thank the hosts for their time

3. **Spaces to target**:
   - Gitcoin community Spaces
   - Public goods funding discussions
   - ReFi/regenerative finance Spaces
   - Ethereum localism conversations
   - Sustainability-focused web3 discussions

### Friend Network Mobilization
- Create a simple template friends can share with their networks
- Provide them with:
  - Pre-written text they can customize
  - Link to your donation page
  - Brief explanation of quadratic funding
  - Personal note about why your work matters

### Targeted Outreach Plan
1. **SuperBenefit supporters**:
   - Ask SuperBenefit to share your campaign with their community
   - Direct message key individuals from the SuperBenefit network
   - Create SuperBenefit-specific messaging emphasizing your knowledge commons contributions

2. **All In For Sport supporters**:
   - Connect your community sustainability work to sports community building
   - Emphasize shared values around community resilience and coordination
   - Target individual relationships you've built through this network

### Telegram Group Strategy
1. **Group Categorization**:
   - **Tier 1**: Groups you're active in and where your project directly aligns
   - **Tier 2**: Groups where you have some presence but less direct alignment
   - **Tier 3**: Larger, less personal groups where your message needs to stand out

2. **Posting Strategy by Tier**:
   - **Tier 1**: Personalized messages mentioning your connection to the group
   - **Tier 2**: Project overview with specific alignment points to the group's focus
   - **Tier 3**: Compelling impact metrics and unique angle to grab attention

3. **Groups to Target**:
   - All Green Pill Network channels
   - ReFi DAO and local nodes
   - Ethereum Localism groups
   - Gitcoin community channels
   - Regenerative finance focused groups
   - DAO governance channels

## Integrated Daily Plan

### Day 1 (Today)
- Begin personal outreach as outlined in the master plan
- Create your poem for tomorrow's distribution
- Follow everyone participating in or tweeting about GG23
- Identify Twitter Spaces happening on Days 2-3

### Day 2 (Tomorrow)
- **Feature: Launch your poem across all platforms**
- Share progress update with early supporters
- Attend 1-2 Twitter Spaces
- Mobilize SuperBenefit and All In For Sport networks
- Post in Tier 1 Telegram groups

### Day 3 (Final Day)

## Measurement & Tracking

Add these metrics to your tracking document:
- Farcaster engagement (casts, replies, recasts)
- Poetry post performance across platforms
- Twitter Spaces attended and connections made
- Telegram groups posted in and response received

## Reminder: Self-Care Approach

This expanded plan includes more activities, but remember:
- **Focus on highest impact**: If energy is limited, prioritize personal outreach
- **Delegate where possible**: Ask team members to help with specific tasks
- **Celebrate small wins**: Each donor and share is a victory
- **Be authentic**: Your passion for this work is your greatest asset
