- **Active users**: 4 people actively using these systems (exceeding goal of 3+)

**Hypercert for Repair Café:**
- ✅ Data collected: items repaired, waste diverted from landfill, participation in Repair Café events, volunteer hours
- ❌ Traditional hypercert not minted
- ✅ **Alternative approach**: Participated in Gitcoin Grants Round 23 (GG23)
- ✅ Created Karma GAP profile for on-chain impact recording: https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/regen-coordination-x-institute-for-community-sustainability-ics/impact
- **Major success**: Achieved top 10% ranking in GG23 funding

**Green Pill Network Chapter:**
- ✅ Chapter application submitted (January 2025)
- ✅ Application approved (February 2025)
- ✅ Separate multisig wallet created for chapter (details in ics-governance repo)
- ✅ Governance structure established using Hats Protocol
- ✅ Four meetings held (March 23, March 30, April 10, June 9, 2025)
- **Attendance**: 4 people at each meeting

**Web3 Onboarding:**
- 🔄 Workshop in development (not yet delivered)
- ✅ Research phase completed: gathered information from various partners, sources, and courses
- ✅ Developing TWO formats:
  - Introductory workshop
  - 8-week learning cohort experience for London community
- **Community feedback**: Locals want to learn how to "do"/participate in web3, not just learn theory
- **Goal**: Showcase through simultaneous learning and doing how web3 tools enable local social impact

### Participation data
[NEED INFO - Numbers, demographics, engagement levels for each activity]

### Concrete outputs
- ICS multisig wallet (0x3B454B53B4c414fFa8297EC49C9d5F040Cf035f8) and ENS domain (theics.eth) operational
- Cell State governance document published in public repository
- Hats Protocol tree (100/119) configured with roles
- CharmVerse workspace actively used for coordination
- Snapshot space for voting established
- GreenPill London chapter approved and operational with separate multisig
- Four GreenPill London meetings held with consistent attendance
- Integration with SuperBenefit's on-chain accounting system
- Karma GAP profile with on-chain impact attestations
- Successful GG23 campaign achieving top 10% ranking
- Web3 onboarding curriculum in development (intro workshop + 8-week cohort)

### Timeline reality
- Implementation plan targeted March-May 2025 completion
- Actual timeline extended to July 2025 (reporting point)
- **Timeline shifts were driven by opportunities rather than delays**:
  - Earthfest booth opportunity arose and was prioritized
  - GG23 funding round opportunity emerged and required immediate focus
  - ETHDenver trip provided valuable in-person connections with GreenPill network
- **Key insight**: The timeline had to respond to circumstances and team capacity rather than forcing a predetermined sequence and timing of events
- This flexible approach led to better outcomes (e.g., GG23 success, stronger network connections)

### Resource usage
- **OTF Budget**: [TO BE COMPLETED - Not very much of the budget was spent, need exact figures]
- **Volunteer contributions**: Dozens if not hundreds of hours contributed by core team and volunteers
- **In-kind contributions**: 
  - Space for GreenPill meetings
  - Earthfest booth materials and setup
  - Time and expertise from advisors and partners
- [NOTE: More detailed budget breakdown to be added later]

## Surprises and Discoveries

### Positive surprises
- **GG23 success**: Achieved top 10% ranking in Gitcoin Grants Round 23, which was far beyond expectations for our first time participating
- **GreenPill meetings exceeded plan**: Hosted 4+ meetings instead of the single planned inaugural meeting, showing sustained engagement
- **GreenPill Toronto event**: Unexpected opportunity to participate in the GreenPill Toronto event at Consensus conference in May 2025
- **Earthfest booth opportunity**: Secured a booth at Earthfest to introduce GreenPill to the broader London community
- **ETHDenver connections**: Heenal had the opportunity to attend ETHDenver and connect with GreenPill stewards and activists in person, strengthening network connections

### Challenges
- **Web3 newcomer mobilization**: It has been harder than expected to mobilize people who are new to Web3 - the learning curve and skepticism were higher barriers than anticipated
- **Onboarding workshop timing**: The planned workshop felt unnecessary for where the community was at - there weren't enough people ready to participate in a formal workshop
- **Timeline flexibility required**: The timeline had to respond to circumstances and team capacity rather than following the predetermined sequence and timing of events

### Emergent opportunities
- **Earthfest booth**: Unexpected opportunity to have a presence at this major local sustainability event
- **GG23 funding round**: The chance to participate in Gitcoin Grants Round 23 emerged as a major opportunity
- **GreenPill Toronto @ Consensus**: Invitation to participate in the GreenPill Toronto event at the Consensus conference
- **Community currency workshop**: Scott Morris workshop on community currencies opened possibilities for developing a commitment pooling system for London
- **AllIRL tool discovery**: Found the AllIRL tool for conducting in-person quadratic funding experiments

### Invalidated assumptions
- **Expected more local engagement**: Thought there would be more immediate engagement from Londoners with web3 initiatives, but the interest was lower than anticipated
- **Hypercert approach**: Original assumption was to mint a traditional hypercert, but Karma GAP proved more appropriate as it's become almost the standard in the regen space
- **Workshop format**: Assumed a single workshop would work, but community feedback showed need for deeper, ongoing learning experiences

### New understanding
- **Karma GAP as standard**: Realized that Karma GAP has become the de facto standard for impact tracking in the regen space, making it more appropriate than traditional hypercerts for the kind of impact we're tracking
- **Learning by doing preference**: Community members want to actively participate in web3, not just learn about it theoretically - they need hands-on experience
- **Opportunistic timeline benefits**: Responding to opportunities as they arise (rather than forcing predetermined timelines) led to better outcomes like GG23 success and valuable conference connections
- **Dual approach needed**: Need both introductory content AND deeper cohort experiences to meet different community member needs

## Stakeholder Experiences

### Direct quotes
[WAITING ON HEENAL FOR TESTIMONIALS/QUOTES]
- **Governance tools**: No specific feedback - the 4 active users were already familiar with these types of tools
- **GG23 campaign**: No specific quotes recalled (Twitter account @heenalr may have some public responses)
- **Earthfest booth**: Conversations were mostly high-level introductions to concepts rather than detailed feedback

### Experience variations
- **Web3 experience differences**: There were definitely differences in web3 experience and engagement with certain tools by different team members
  - Not everyone felt comfortable navigating all tools (e.g., Hats Protocol) 
  - However, everyone could handle the basics of what was needed
  - Those with more web3 experience naturally took on more technical tasks
- **Relationship to ICS**: Everyone involved already had some relationship to ICS, so there wasn't a stark insider/outsider dynamic
- **Local vs global**: Primary engagement was from local participants already connected to ICS network

### Satisfaction indicators
- Team members continued to show up and engage throughout the experiment
- Consistent attendance at GreenPill meetings (4 people at each meeting)
- Successful GG23 campaign suggests community support for the work

### Behaviour changes
- **Increased web3 awareness**: Participants are definitely becoming more aware of the potential of web3 on a local level
- **Tool usage**: Core team members now regularly use CharmVerse, multisig, and other governance tools
- Otherwise, not much dramatic behavior change - more of a gradual shift in understanding and capability

### Relationship shifts
- **Strengthened collaboration**: The experiment has fostered connection and co-creation among the 4 members actively involved
- **Joint initiatives emerging**: The closer collaboration is sparking joint initiatives and projects beyond the original scope
- **Shared language**: Team now has shared vocabulary and understanding around web3 governance concepts

## Progress Against Intentions

### Challenge progress
From the Discovery Report, key challenges included:

**1. Governance bottlenecks**
- **Progress**: Limited - The new infrastructure hasn't yet touched everyday decision-making. Still in experimental phase and some way from practical implementation
- **Decision efficiency**: No change yet - decisions are still being made through traditional processes
- **Outlook**: Infrastructure is in place but integration into daily operations is still 6-18 months away

**2. Contributor engagement**
- **Volunteer engagement with new systems**: No - ICS volunteers haven't been engaged with the new systems in any significant way yet
- **Ease of participation**: Not yet improved, but strong belief that the systems being created will make engagement much easier in the coming 6-18 months
- **Current state**: Only the core team of 4 is using the new governance tools

**3. Community ownership and resilience**
- **Ownership feelings**: Mixed - Within the core team of 4, everyone now feels some ownership of ICS. However, this hasn't extended to the broader volunteer base
- **Decentralized approach impact**: Not yet realized, but expected to develop over time
- **Current limitation**: Benefits of decentralization remain within the small experimental group

**4. Funding and financial sustainability**
- **GG23 impact**: Not materially significant financially, but the impressive success has encouraged the team and built confidence about future opportunities
- **New funding pathways**: Gradually discovering new pathways through web3, but need to focus on completing deliverables to build track record for future applications
- **Strategic insight**: Success breeds success - early wins are opening doors even if not immediately lucrative

### Success indicator status
Original success metrics:
1. ✅ Governance systems operational with 3+ active participants - **ACHIEVED**: 4 active users
2. ✅ At least one Hypercert minted and publicized - **MODIFIED SUCCESS**: Instead of traditional hypercert, achieved on-chain impact recording through Karma GAP profile and top 10% GG23 ranking
3. ✅ First Green Pill Network meetup hosted - **EXCEEDED**: 4 meetings held
4. 🔄 Onboarding workshop developed and piloted - **IN PROGRESS**: Workshop content developed, moving from single workshop to dual format (intro + 8-week cohort)

### Unexpected progress
- **Community pooling & community currency**: Emerging interest and development in commitment pooling systems and local currency initiatives (sparked by Scott Morris workshop)
- **Network effects**: Connections made through conferences and GG23 are creating unexpected collaboration opportunities

### Stalled areas
- **Communication to non-web3 audiences**: Surprisingly difficult to communicate the value of the work to "normies" - the gap between web3 and mainstream understanding is wider than anticipated
- **Progress delays from opportunities**: ETH Denver, GG23, and Consensus Toronto were valuable opportunities but significantly set back progress in other areas due to time and focus requirements
- **Broader volunteer engagement**: Expected to have more ICS volunteers involved by now, but engagement remains limited to core team

## Challenges and Responses

### Challenge descriptions
**Specific obstacles encountered:**
- **Explaining web3 to non-technical audiences**: Major challenge in finding effective ways to communicate web3 concepts to "normies" - the technical jargon and conceptual gap proved larger than expected
- **Time allocation**: Devoting adequate time to the experiment while managing other responsibilities and opportunities
- **Momentum maintenance**: Deciding against a formal GreenPill London launch event meant missing an opportunity to build momentum - the team lost some drive as a result
- **Team capacity**: All 4 core team members were undergoing various stresses/transitions during the implementation period

### Risk realization
Anticipated risks from implementation plan:

1. **ICS decision-making on governance structure** - ✅ NO CHALLENGES - Consensus was easily reached
2. **Coordination between ICS and RPP** - ✅ NO CHALLENGES - Teams were fully aligned throughout
3. **Technical challenges with hypercerts** - ⚠️ PIVOT NEEDED - Not technical issues but adoption considerations; Karma GAP was required for GG23 participation and is becoming the standard in granting rounds
4. **Community engagement sustainability** - 😅 SIDESTEPPED - "We sidestepped this issue by not really engaging with the community much at all LOL"

### Response strategies
**General approach**: 
- Responded fluidly, working with emergence rather than forcing predetermined plans
- Embraced flexibility as opportunities arose

**What worked well**:
- **Flexibility**: Ability to pivot and respond to opportunities as they emerged (GG23, conferences, etc.)
- **Alignment**: Strong coordination between ICS and RPP meant no internal friction
- **Pragmatism**: Choosing Karma GAP over traditional hypercerts based on ecosystem standards

**What didn't work**:
- **Launch event cancellation**: Deciding against a formal GreenPill London launch event robbed the team of a chance to build momentum
- **Limited community engagement**: Focusing on core team meant missing broader community building opportunities
- **Communication strategy**: Still struggling to effectively communicate web3 value to mainstream audiences

### Effectiveness assessment
- **Successful pivots**: Moving to Karma GAP and focusing on GG23 proved highly effective
- **Infrastructure success**: Governance tools are in place and functional for core team
- **Limited reach**: Effectiveness limited by not engaging broader community
- **Mixed results**: Strong technical implementation but weak community adoption

### Adaptation lessons
**What to do differently**:
- **Start web3 workshops/cohorts much earlier**: Don't wait for perfect conditions - begin education early and iterate
- **Plan launch events**: Create momentum-building events even if team capacity is limited
- **Invest in communication**: Develop clear, accessible ways to explain web3 value from the start

**Advice for other communities**:
- **Communication is key**: "Plan out how to communicate - and demonstrate - the value of how you're using web3, in a way that just makes sense to people"
- **Start education early**: Don't underestimate the time needed to bring people along on the web3 journey
- **Be flexible**: Work with emergence rather than rigid plans
- **Expect capacity challenges**: Team members will have life transitions - plan for this reality
