# Please share one story about how the funded project has made a difference in the community and/or people's lives

At our November Repair Café, a family arrived with a cherished stuffed bunny clutching a tattered arm that was hanging on by a thread. The well-worn plush bunny belonged to a young child who watched anxiously as one of our fixers carefully examined the damage. While this may seem like a simple repair to some, the stuffed animal clearly held enormous emotional significance for the child, who remained close by throughout the entire process.

During the same event, another participant brought in a vintage cat clock with moving eyes and tail that had stopped working. Our volunteer fixer carefully diagnosed the issue while explaining the process to the owner, who shared stories about the clock's history in their family.

Nearby, another volunteer was working with careful precision on a delicate task - repairing a broken necklace. Jewelry repairs can be particularly meaningful, as these items often carry deep sentimental value beyond their monetary worth and are frequently connected to important relationships or life events.

These three repairs - completed successfully at a single event - represent the heart of our project's impact. The Repair Café doesn't just fix broken objects; it preserves connections to memories, relationships, and personal histories that would otherwise be lost when items are discarded. The young child's relief at having their companion restored, the cat clock once again marking time with its whimsical movements, and the necklace ready to be worn again - each represents a small but meaningful victory against our throwaway culture.

The impact extends beyond the individual items repaired. We regularly observe the transformation in participants' attitudes as they witness the repair process. Many express surprise and delight at discovering that items they assumed were beyond repair can be given new life. As one participant remarked after seeing their broken record player successfully repaired, "I'll never throw something out so quickly again without at least trying to fix it."

Through these personalized interactions and successful repairs, our project builds a community that values preservation over replacement, skills over consumption, and connection over convenience - one stuffed bunny, cat clock, and broken necklace at a time.
