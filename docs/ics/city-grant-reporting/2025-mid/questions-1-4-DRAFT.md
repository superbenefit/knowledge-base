Based on mid-year data:
- Total unique individuals: 717
- Children (0-12): 63
- Youth (13-25): 180
- Adults (26-64): 362
- Older Adults (65+): 112
- Families: 43

## Question 1: How has the project impacted the identified equity-denied groups?

Throughout the first half of 2025, our Waste Reduction Initiatives have continued to make meaningful impacts on equity-denied groups through accessible programming and genuine community connection.

Older Adults (65+) - 112 older adults participated in our programs, particularly the Repair Café where they find both practical support and social connection. Beyond fixing beloved items, these events combat isolation and create spaces where seniors can share their knowledge and skills. The act of repairing items with sentimental value - like family heirlooms or cherished tools - offers dignity and respect for their histories.

Persons with Low Income - In a time of rising costs, our free repair services have tangible financial impact. With 262 items repaired through Repair Café and 532 tools available through the Thing Library, participants can extend the life of essential household items rather than facing replacement costs. This preserves limited budgets while also reducing the burden of consumer culture on those already struggling financially.

Newcomers to London - Our programs create welcoming points of connection that transcend language barriers. The hands-on nature of repair and tool-sharing provides practical support while introducing newcomers to community resources and neighbours. The tactile, collaborative environment of Repair Café particularly allows relationships to form through shared purpose rather than requiring perfect English.

Geographic Accessibility - Our expansion to Thames Centre (Dorchester Library) and rotation through various London library locations ensures diverse neighbourhoods can access our services without needing personal vehicles, serving communities that might otherwise be overlooked.

Volunteers and Skills-Sharing - By welcoming more volunteers as 'helpers' and onboarding new fixers, we're building a distributed model of community resilience where knowledge flows in multiple directions, not just from 'expert' to 'novice.'

## Question 2: How has the project supported anti-racism, anti-oppression, diversity, equity and inclusion?

Our waste reduction initiatives work to dismantle barriers and challenge systems that perpetuate exclusion and inequality.

Challenging Consumer Culture's Inequities - The mainstream waste and consumer system disproportionately harms marginalized communities through environmental racism, planned obsolescence that burdens low-income households, and a culture that devalues repair knowledge often held by immigrant and working-class communities. By centring repair, reuse, and mutual aid, we resist these extractive systems and honour skills and knowledge that dominant culture dismisses.

Building Cross-Cultural Community - Our volunteer team reflects London's diversity, and our programs create spaces where cross-cultural exchange happens organically through shared work. At our eco markets, we're deliberately building community with artisans from diverse backgrounds who create from upcycled materials, celebrating creativity that exists outside colonial notions of value and waste.

Shifting Power Dynamics - Rather than positioning ourselves as experts providing services, we facilitate spaces where community members share knowledge and skills with each other. This challenges the helper/helped binary and creates horizontal relationships of mutual support. When an established fixer mentors a newcomer, or when neighbours teach each other repair techniques, we're redistributing power and expertise.

Geographic Justice - Our experiment inn Thames Centre and rotation through library locations in different neighbourhoods is deliberate - we're bringing resources to communities rather than expecting people to come to us. This addresses transportation barriers that disproportionately affect low-income residents, disabled community members, and those without vehicles.

Removing Financial Barriers - Keeping all programs free isn't just about accessibility - it's about rejecting the idea that only those with money deserve access to tools, skills, and community support. This directly challenges economic systems that exclude and marginalize.

Learning and Accountability - We recognize that we're still learning. We're working to ensure our programs don't just serve diverse communities but are shaped by them, listening to feedback and adjusting our approach to better meet real needs.

## Question 3: Please share one story about how the funded project has made a difference in the community and/or people's lives

Our first Repair Café in Thames Centre at Dorchester Library brought together two moments that capture what this work is really about.

An elderly gentleman arrived carrying a worn stuffed bear - one of his few remaining possessions from childhood. The bear's arm had torn badly and was threatening to come off. "I don't have much left from back then," he said quietly as he handed it to KW, one of our fixers. KW worked carefully on the delicate repair, understanding this wasn't just about stitching fabric but about preserving memory and connection across decades. When the bear was whole again, the man held it close before tucking it carefully away, visibly moved.

At the same event, we witnessed something equally meaningful unfolding. One of our senior fixers who's been coming to Repair Cafés for years, was working alongside his neighbour - a young man in his twenties who is new to Canada. He has been mentoring him both at our events and outside them, sharing repair skills and knowledge. Watching them work together - the experienced hands guiding the newer ones, patience and care flowing between generations and across cultures - showed how our spaces create relationships that extend beyond the events themselves.

These moments embodied why we do this work. We preserve not just objects but dignity and memory. We build mentorship that crosses age and culture. We create spaces where people genuinely help each other, where knowledge is shared freely, where community forms through care rather than transaction. The stuffed bear repair preserved one man's connection to his past. The mentorship relationship is building someone's capacity for their future. Both happened because we created space for community to gather and support each other.

## Question 4: Are there any additional comments you would like to make about your results?

We're encouraged by some developments in the first half of 2025, while recognizing areas where growth has been slower than hoped.

Our pivot to smaller monthly eco markets rather than large one-off events is showing promise. We're developing deeper relationships with artisans working with upcycled materials and building a more consistent community rather than just reaching big numbers.

The expansion to Thames Centre demonstrated real hunger for these services beyond London's core. The community response suggests regional expansion could be valuable if we have capacity.

Adding volunteer helpers alongside experienced fixers is changing our culture - creating more welcoming entry points and building a pipeline for future fixers. We're seeing mentorship relationships develop organically.

However, Thing Library membership hasn't grown as we'd hoped. We're in a time of organizational evolution, which has affected our ability to promote and develop this program consistently. We're exploring partnerships as a way forward - working with other organizations who might help expand reach and sustainability for the library.

The numbers of individuals served and items repaired show sustained community need. We're learning to balance growth with depth, focusing on quality of connection rather than just expanding numbers. We're committed to listening, adjusting, and building on what's working while being honest about where we're still finding our way.
