# Community Exchange: Visual Concept

*Note: This document specifies the diagrams needed for the Community Connection & Commitment Commons documentation. These visuals will be developed in v0.3.*

## 1. Three Components Relationship Diagram

This diagram will illustrate the relationship between the three main components of the system:

- **Belonging Commons** (entry level)
  - Represented as welcoming, accessible community soup gatherings
  - Shows how people enter the system through participation without requirements

- **Connection Commons** (relationships level)
  - Visualized as connection circles where people share skills and interests
  - Speech bubbles showing "I can teach..." and "I want to learn..."
  - Shows how relationships and skills are tracked informally

- **Commitment Commons** (exchange level)
  - Visualized as a structured pool with formalized commitments
  - Shows how resources flow through the credit-based system
  - Illustrates relationship between commitments and credits

Arrows should show how participants can move between these components and how they reinforce each other.

## 2. Commitment Commons Flow Diagram

This detailed diagram will show the full lifecycle of credits and commitments:

1. Member registration and commitment definition
2. Commitment evaluation and credit limit assignment
3. Member A offers a commitment to the pool
4. Member B redeems that commitment
5. Member A receives credits
6. Member A uses credits to receive something from Member C
7. The cycle continues, showing how value circulates
8. Includes conflict resolution and rebalancing mechanisms

## 3. Connection Commons Flow Diagram

This diagram will illustrate the process of the Connection Commons gatherings:

1. Gathering structure with zones for different activities
2. Participant interaction patterns during the event
3. Post-event matching and follow-up process
4. Documentation and tracking of connections made
5. Long-term relationship building outcomes

## 4. Implementation Roadmap

A timeline visualization showing the three phases of implementation:

1. **Foundation Phase** (Months 1-3)
   - Key milestones, activities, and goals

2. **Growth Phase** (Months 4-9)
   - Expansion strategies and technology adoption

3. **Maturity Phase** (Months 10-18)
   - Advanced features and integration possibilities

## 5. Community Growth Network Model

This network diagram will illustrate how the system scales:

1. Initial core group of founding members (center)
2. First-wave members connecting to the core
3. New neighborhood circles forming around key members
4. Inter-circle connections and resource flows
5. Integration with other community systems

## 6. Technology Transition Diagram

This will show the evolution of the tracking system:

1. Phase 1: Paper-based and Google Sheets tracking
2. Phase 2: Training and transition period 
3. Phase 3: Full implementation of Sarafu.Network or other digital system

Includes screens/interfaces from each system to illustrate the progression.

## 7. Individual Experience Journey Map

This diagram will trace one hypothetical member's experience:

1. Initial discovery and attendance at a soup gathering
2. Participation in Connection Commons events
3. First commitment added to the pool
4. First exchange experience
5. Growing participation and impact over time
6. Eventually becoming a steward or advocate

## 8. Connection-to-Commitment Pathway

This specialized diagram will show how connections made in the Connection Commons can evolve into formalized commitments:

1. Initial connection and skill-sharing discussion
2. Informal exchange outside the system
3. Recognition of ongoing value
4. Formalization as a commitment in the pool
5. Integration into the wider exchange network

*Design Guidelines: These visuals should use a consistent color scheme and style, emphasizing community, connection, and abundance rather than scarcity. Use circular designs to emphasize the cyclical, regenerative nature of the system. Ensure accessibility through clear contrast and meaningful use of color coding.*
