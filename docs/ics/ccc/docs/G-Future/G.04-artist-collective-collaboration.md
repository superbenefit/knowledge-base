# Artist Collective Collaboration

## Overview

Local artist collectives Corduroy and Xuux demonstrate how Community Exchange can support creative communities while potentially creating new market access opportunities. This model explores both internal trading networks and external customer acquisition strategies.

## Partner Organizations

### Corduroy
- Local arts and media collective
- Runs collaborative/cooperative artists' program
- Steward Lliam is part of Greenpill London
- Established infrastructure for artist support

### Xuux
- Another local artists cooperative
- Active creative community network
- Potential for cross-pollination with Corduroy

## Potential Applications

### 1. Internal Artist Economy
**Service Trading Examples:**

- Equipment lending/sharing networks

### 2. Community Access Marketplace
**Credit-Based Services:**

- Creative workshops and skill-sharing

### 3. Bridge to Cash Economy
**Hybrid Models:**
- Sample services for credits to build portfolios
- Credit + cash hybrid pricing (e.g., 2 credits + $20 for custom artwork)
- Converting credit-earned relationships to cash clients

### 4. Local Business Partnerships
**Collaborative Opportunities:**
