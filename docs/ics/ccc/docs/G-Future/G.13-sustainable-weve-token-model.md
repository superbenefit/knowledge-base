# Sustainable WEVE Token Model

## Overview

This document outlines a sustainable token model for the WEVE community exchange system. The model balances:
- Providing necessary cash liquidity for businesses
- Encouraging token circulation within the community
- Ensuring financial sustainability of the backing pool
- Creating incentives for long-term participation

## Core Mechanisms

### 1. Tiered Cash-Out Fee Structure

Rather than a flat redemption fee, we implement a graduated fee based on monthly redemption volume:

| Monthly WEVE Redemption | Fee Percentage | Example |
|-------------------------|----------------|---------|
| First 100 WEVE          | 10%            | 100 WEVE → $90 |
| 101-500 WEVE            | 15%            | +400 WEVE → $340 |
| 501-1000 WEVE           | 20%            | +500 WEVE → $400 |
| 1000+ WEVE              | 25%            | All additional → 75¢ on the dollar |

**Benefits:**
- Small businesses can access needed cash with minimal friction
- Larger redemptions contribute more to system sustainability
- Creates natural incentive to find ways to spend WEVE rather than cash out
- Single mechanism that's easier to explain than multiple separate policies

### 2. Time-Locking Rewards

A staking system that rewards longer-term holding without enabling farming behavior:

| Lock Period | Monthly Reward | Example |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| 1 month     | 1.0%           | 100 WEVE → 101 WEVE after 1 month |
| 3 months    | 1.5%           | 100 WEVE → 104.5 WEVE after 3 months |
| 6 months    | 2.0%           | 100 WEVE → 112 WEVE after 6 months |

**Protections:**
- Rewards paid only in WEVE tokens, not cash
- Early withdrawal penalties (50% of accrued rewards)
- Earned rewards must be spent within network (non-redeemable)
- Only original principal can be redeemed for cash

### 3. B2B Marketplace Development

A focused approach to building complete value flows:

- **Supply Chain Mapping**: Identify what participating businesses need to purchase
- **Strategic Recruitment**: Target service providers and suppliers those businesses use
- **B2B Directory**: Searchable database of business offerings and needs
- **Integration Support**: Help businesses adapt accounting and payment processes

**Key Sectors:**
- Professional services (accounting, design, legal)
- Inventory suppliers for retail businesses
- Maintenance and repair services
- Marketing and promotion
- Staff benefits and perks

### 4. Circulation Incentives

Mechanisms to encourage WEVE to circulate rather than be cashed out:

- **Business Credit**: Monthly bonus of 5 WEVE for businesses that spend 30%+ of received WEVE
- **Discover Discounts**: Directory of "first purchase" special offers between businesses
- **Receipt Lottery**: Monthly drawing for businesses that circulate WEVE
- **Community Fund**: Portion of cash-out fees funds community projects voted on by token holders

### 5. Consumer Engagement

Strategies to keep individual consumers engaged in the system:

- **Discounts**: Businesses offer better prices for WEVE payments
- **Exclusive Access**: Special events, products, or services available only with WEVE
- **Referral Rewards**: Earn WEVE for bringing new participants into the system
- **Loyalty Program**: Increased rewards for consistent participation

## Financial Sustainability

### System Initialization

- Initial offering: 10,000 WEVE sold for $8,000 (promotional price of $0.80 per WEVE)
- Target token velocity: Each WEVE circulates 12+ times annually
- Settlement assumption: 60% of WEVE eventually cashed out, 40% remains in circulation

### Revenue Streams

- Cash-out fees (primary revenue)
- Business membership fees
- Consumer membership options
- Enterprise partner sponsorships
- Grant funding for social impact

### Expense Coverage

Cash-out fees and other revenue must cover:
- Technology maintenance
- Marketing and outreach
- Redemption liquidity
- Staking rewards
- Administrative costs

### 6. Price Adjustment as Economic Lever

A powerful economic mechanism using the meal-standard peg (10 WEVE = 1 Reimagine meal):

- **Increasing Purchasing Power**: When meal prices increase (e.g., $10 to $12), WEVE spending power automatically increases
- **Asymmetric Adjustment**: Spending value adjusts immediately, but redemption value adjusts more slowly (on a 12-month rolling average)
- **Strategic Stimulus Tool**: Modest price increases (3-5%) can be used to stimulate WEVE circulation
- **Seasonal Management**: Price adjustments before slow periods can boost economic activity
- **Natural Velocity Improvement**: Creates incentive to spend WEVE rather than hold or cash out

This approach provides Reimagine with an economic management lever similar to how central banks use interest rates, while protecting against redemption rushes through the asymmetric adjustment rule.

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1: Core System**
   - Tiered cash-out fee structure
   - Basic token issuance and redemption
   - Initial business recruitment

2. **Phase 2: Engagement Enhancement**
   - Time-locking rewards
   - B2B marketplace directory
   - First circulation incentives

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
   - Enhanced B2B integration tools
   - Community fund governance
   - Advanced analytics and reporting

## Measuring Success

- **Circulation Ratio**: Percentage of tokens that circulate vs. cash out
- **Velocity**: Average number of times each token changes hands annually
- **Network Growth**: Number of active businesses and consumers
- **Cash Runway**: Months of redemption coverage at current rates
- **Community Impact**: Social and economic value created

This model will evolve based on community feedback and real-world performance metrics.

## Reimagine Business Model Integration

### Target: $5,000/Month Additional Profit Through Meal Sales

A key goal for Reimagine is to generate $5,000/month in additional profit through increased meal sales via the WEVE system:

- **Current Volume**: 600 meals/month at $10 each
- **Target**: Additional 1,250-1,667 meals/month (assuming $3-4 profit per meal)
- **Total Goal**: 1,850-2,267 meals/month
- **Daily Increase**: Approximately 40-55 additional meals per day

### WEVE Circulation Required

To support this business goal:

- **Monthly WEVE for Meals**: 1,250-1,667 WEVE specifically for Reimagine
- **Total WEVE Network Volume**: 5,000-11,000 WEVE ($50,000-$110,000 monthly)
- **Sustainable Balance**: Reimagine should be 15-25% of total network volume
- **Active WEVE in Circulation**: 1,000-2,200 WEVE (assuming 5x monthly velocity)

### Backing Requirements

| Backing Type | Amount | Percentage |
|--------------|--------|------------|
| Cash Reserves | $5,000-$11,000 | 50% |
| Business Commitments | 3,250-7,150 WEVE | 30-35% |
| Personal Commitments | 1,750-3,850 WEVE | 15-20% |
| **Total Backing** | **10,000-22,000 WEVE** | **100%** |

### Strategic Approach

To drive these additional meals:

1. **Dual Pricing Strategy**:
   - Cash price: $12
   - WEVE price: 1 WEVE (worth $10)
   - 20% incentive for WEVE usage

2. **Meal Package Offers**:
   - "Meal Club" memberships paid in WEVE
   - Bulk meal purchases at deeper discounts
   - Weekly specials only available in WEVE

3. **B2B Meal Solutions**:
   - Target local businesses for lunch orders
   - Offer catering packages priced in WEVE
   - Business meeting packages paid in WEVE

## Understanding Commitments

### What "Committing" Really Means

When a business or individual "commits" resources to the pool (e.g., 50 WEVE of web design services monthly):

#### What It Is:
- A **promise** to provide services up to that value when requested
- A **capacity limit** - "I can handle up to 50 WEVE worth of work per month"
- An **authorization** to accept this form of payment
- A **contribution** to the system's overall capacity

#### What It Is NOT:
- Not setting aside cash reserves
- Not necessarily providing services every month
- Not a financial loss or expense
- Not an obligation to serve any specific person

### Monthly Commitment Renewal

Commitments represent renewable capacity, not cumulative obligations:

| Month | Starting Commitment | Usage | Ending Commitment | Next Month's Commitment |
|-------|---------------------|-------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Jan   | 50 WEVE            | 0 WEVE| 50 WEVE           | Still 50 WEVE          |
| Feb   | 50 WEVE            | 30 WEVE| 20 WEVE           | Resets to 50 WEVE      |
| Mar   | 50 WEVE            | 50 WEVE| 0 WEVE            | Resets to 50 WEVE      |

### Personal Commitments

Personal commitments are essential to the system - they're what makes this truly community-based rather than just a business discount network:

**Types of Valuable Personal Commitments:**
- **Home & Garden Skills**: Garden produce, snow removal, lawn care
- **Food Production**: Home baking, preserves, homemade meals
- **Care & Support**: Childcare, elder visits, pet sitting
- **Repairs & Making**: Bicycle fixing, clothing repairs, crafts
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Tutoring, language practice, tech help
- **Creative Services**: Photography, design, music lessons

For a balanced system, personal commitments should represent 25-35% of total commitment backing.

## Demurrage & Staking Mechanics

### Demurrage: Encouraging Circulation

To maintain healthy circulation, we implement a demurrage feature:

- **Rate**: 1% monthly decay on WEVE balances inactive for 60+ days
- **Mechanism**: Automatic reduction in wallet balance for "aging" WEVE
- **Exemption**: Staked WEVE is exempt from demurrage
- **Recovery**: "Lost" value feeds the community fund or system operations

**Benefits:**
- Creates natural pressure to keep WEVE circulating
- Discourages hoarding and dormant balances
- Complements staking rewards as a "use it or commit it" system
- Reduces redemption pressure during price adjustments
- Provides predictable circulation patterns for system stability

**Historical Precedent:**
This approach is inspired by successful local currencies like the Wörgl experiment in Austria during the Great Depression, which achieved circulation velocity 12-14 times higher than the national currency and funded significant public works while reducing unemployment by 25%.

### Staking: Building System Backing

Staking isn't just about rewards—it's a critical mechanism for building robust system backing:

- **Hard Cash Entry**: When people buy WEVE to stake it, real dollars enter the backing pool
- **Locked Liquidity**: Staked WEVE can't be immediately redeemed, providing stability
- **Commitment Signaling**: Shows long-term faith in the system
- **Redemption Buffer**: Creates a cushion against redemption pressure

**Trust Protection for Stakers:**
- **Transparent Reserve Ratio**: Real-time visibility of both cash reserves and commitment reserves
- **Legal Protection**: Dedicated account for staked funds with formal agreements
- **Priority Redemption**: Stakers get first access to reserves in case of system stress
- **Governance Rights**: Stakers participate in major system decisions

**The Dual-Force System:**
By combining demurrage penalties with staking rewards, we create perfect balance:
- **Demurrage**: "Use it or lose it" → Promotes circulation
- **Staking**: "Commit it and grow it" → Builds backing

This ensures that no WEVE sits idle—it either actively circulates through the community or explicitly supports the system through staking.

## System Transparency

### Comprehensive Reserve Dashboard

To build trust and provide full visibility, we implement a real-time dashboard showing:

#### 1. Cash Reserves
- Total cash in reserve account
- Percentage backing of circulating WEVE
- Transaction history (deposits/withdrawals)
- Reserve ratio trends over time

#### 2. Commitment Reserves
- Total value of active commitments in the pool
- Categorized by type (business services, goods, personal skills)
- Fulfillment rate statistics (% of commitments successfully completed)
- Capacity utilization metrics

#### 3. Combined Health Metrics
- Total system backing (cash + commitments)
- Circulation velocity (how quickly WEVE is moving)
- Redemption patterns
- System growth trends

### Understanding Capacity Utilization

Capacity utilization measures how much of the available committed resources are actually being used:

- **Example**: If the pool contains 10,000 WEVE of monthly commitments but only 3,000 WEVE worth are being requested/used, the utilization rate is 30%

- **Low Utilization** (under 30%): May indicate mismatch between commitments and community needs

- **Healthy Utilization** (30-70%): Shows active usage while maintaining flexibility

- **High Utilization** (over 70%): Indicates popular commitments that might need more providers

Tracking utilization helps identify underused resources and ensure the commitment pool reflects what the community actually needs.

### Benefits of Dual Transparency

This approach:
1. **Shows True Value**: Demonstrates that the system is backed by real economic value, not just cash
2. **Builds Complete Trust**: Users can see that even if cash is limited, the commitment network is robust
3. **Reframes "Backing"**: Helps people understand that commitments are legitimate backing, not just cash
4. **Educates Users**: Teaches the community how mutual credit really works

## Decimal Placement & Value Standard

### The Meal Standard

After exploring various options including 1 WEVE = $10, $1, $0.10, etc., we've chosen to use:

- **Starting Value**: 1 WEVE = $1
- **Inflation Protection**: 10 WEVE = 1 Reimagine meal (always)
- **Adjustment Protocol**: When meal prices change, WEVE value adjusts proportionally

**Benefits of the Meal Standard:**
- Connected to something community members actually use
- Built-in business alignment with Reimagine
- Clear emotional resonance ("this buys a meal")
- Protocol-based inflation protection (no community voting required)

### Managing Redemption Risk

To prevent redemption rushes when meal prices increase, we use the asymmetric adjustment rule:

- **Spending power increases immediately** (10 WEVE still buys a meal)
- **Redemption value adjusts gradually** (based on 12-month rolling average)

This creates three mechanisms to maintain system health:

1. **Arbitrage Prevention**: The timing difference prevents quick profit-taking
2. **Natural Circulation Incentive**: Encourages spending rather than cashing out
3. **Network Value Building**: Directs value into the network rather than extraction

The asymmetric approach protects the liquidity pool while still maintaining WEVE's purchasing power for essential local goods.

## WEVE Customer Acquisition Model

This model demonstrates how the WEVE network serves as a customer acquisition channel for Reimagine, bringing in new customers who participate in the network:

| Month | WEVE Network Participants | New Reimagine Customers | Meals Per New Customer/Mo | Meals Sold (WEVE) | Additional Monthly Profit |
|-------|---------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Jun 2025 | 18 (3B + 15I) | 25 | 4 | 100 | $500 |
| Jul 2025 | 29 (4B + 25I) | 38 | 4 | 150 | $750 |
| Aug 2025 | 45 (5B + 40I) | 50 | 4 | 200 | $1,000 |
| Sep 2025 | 66 (6B + 60I) | 75 | 4 | 300 | $1,500 |
| Oct 2025 | 87 (7B + 80I) | 100 | 4 | 400 | $2,000 |
| Nov 2025 | 109 (9B + 100I) | 125 | 4 | 500 | $2,500 |
| Dec 2025 | 130 (10B + 120I) | 150 | 4 | 600 | $3,000 |
| Q1 2026 | 195 (15B + 180I) | 200 | 4 | 800 | $4,000 |
| Q2 2026 | 275 (25B + 250I) | 250 | 4 | 1,000 | $5,000 |
| Q3 2026 | 450 (50B + 400I) | 325 | 4 | 1,300 | $6,500 |
| Q4 2026 | 700 (100B + 600I) | 400 | 4 | 1,600 | $8,000 |

### Key Observations

1. **Network Growth**: The model shows steady growth from 18 participants (3 businesses + 15 individuals) to 700 participants (100 businesses + 600 individuals) over 18 months

2. **Customer Conversion**: By Q4 2026, approximately 57% of network participants (400 out of 700) would be Reimagine customers

3. **Consistent Purchasing**: Each new customer averages 4 meals per month throughout the period

4. **Financial Target**: Reaches the $5,000/month additional profit target by Q2 2026, with growth to $8,000/month by Q4 2026

5. **Business Case**: Creates clear ROI for Reimagine's investment in building the WEVE network, as each new participant represents potential new business

This model demonstrates how the WEVE network acts as both a community economic system and a sustainable customer acquisition channel for anchor businesses like Reimagine.
