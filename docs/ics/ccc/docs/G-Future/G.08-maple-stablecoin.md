# $MAPLE: The Canadian Regenerative Value Token

## Overview

$MAPLE is an envisioned CAD-pegged token designed to support Canadian regenerative financial ecosystems and integrate with the Community Exchange (CCC) platform. As a decentralized community currency, $MAPLE would generate yield that supports both network stability and Canadian regenerative initiatives.

## Positioning with $BREAD

## Core Use Cases

$MAPLE serves three primary functions:

1. **Intra-DAO Transactions**: Facilitating seamless value exchange within and between Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
2. **Canadian DAO Contributor Payments**: Enabling organizations to compensate Canadian contributors in a currency that maintains CAD purchasing power
3. **Auto-PGF Treasury Holdings**: Serving as a stable reserve asset for Automatic Public Goods Funding (Auto-PGF) mechanisms

### Positioning with $BREAD

$MAPLE and $BREAD serve different but complementary purposes:
- $BREAD: Regenerative CAD-denominated value token for wider economic transformation
- $MAPLE: Specifically designed for Canadian commitment pool networks

Both support regenerative economics through different approaches:
- $BREAD focuses on yield generation for mutual aid
- $MAPLE focuses on facilitating community commitment exchanges and DAO operations

Our communities naturally align and may interact, but these are distinct systems with distinct purposes.

### Liquidity Pair Strategy

**BREAD-MAPLE Liquidity Pools**:
1. **Economic Bridge**: Enable seamless trading between US and Canadian regenerative economies
2. **Arbitrage Protection**: Maintain relative value stability between the two currencies
3. **Cross-Border Cooperation**: Facilitate international mutual aid and community projects
4. **Deeper Liquidity**: Combined pool depth increases stability for both tokens

**Liquidity Benefits**:
- Lower slippage for cross-border transactions
- Reduced forex conversion costs
- Stable value for regenerative initiatives operating in both countries
- Increased adoption through network effects

### Economic Synergies

1. **Shared Value Creation**: Both communities benefit from each other's economic activity
2. **Risk Diversification**: Currency risks spread across two national economies
3. **Knowledge Exchange**: Technical and social innovations flow bi-directionally
4. **Scaling Effects**: Combined userbase strengthens both ecosystems

## Integration with Community Exchange

### Connection Circles Integration

1. **Skill Exchange Economy**: Members can offer skills/services priced in $MAPLE for those preferring immediate settlement
2. **Cross-Pool Facilitation**: $MAPLE acts as a bridge when Connection Circle relationships evolve into formalized exchanges across different pools
3. **Value Recognition**: Outstanding contributions in Connection Circles could earn $MAPLE rewards, creating incentives for quality engagement

### Commitment Pool Integration

1. **Reserve Asset**: Commitment pools can hold $MAPLE as a stable reserve alongside credits
2. **Inter-Pool Trading**: Different commitment pools can trade using $MAPLE when direct credit swaps aren't feasible
3. **Exit Option**: Members can convert earned credits to $MAPLE to connect with the broader economy
4. **Boundary Objects**: $MAPLE serves as a "boundary object" allowing credits to cross between pools with different valuations

## Technical Architecture

### Governance Structure
- Operates via a DAO to maintain decentralization
- Community decision-making for yield distribution (similar to $BREAD model)
- Transparent on-chain governance for all major decisions

### Collateralization Model
- **Phase 1**: 120% overcollateralization using USDC/USDT
- **Phase 2**: Transition to Canadian asset backing as they become tokenized
  - Canadian Government Investment Certificates (GICs)
  - Tokenized Canadian ETFs
  - Canadian Community Impact Bonds
  - Canadian Real World Assets (RWAs)

### Exchange Mechanism
- USDC-to-MAPLE swaps (direct fiat exchange avoided initially)
- Dynamic exchange rates based on supply, demand, and USD/CAD forex rates

## Conversion Rate Structure

### Credit-to-$MAPLE Exchange Rates
- Individual commitment pools set their own exchange rates
- Market-based fluctuation within steward-defined bands (e.g., 1 credit = 5-10 $MAPLE)
- Quarterly adjustments based on:
  - Community demand
  - Pool health metrics
  - Regional economic conditions
  - Actual usage patterns

## Yield Distribution System

### Dynamic Yield Allocation
1. **Below Collateralization Target**: Yield goes to treasury for stability
2. **Above Target**: Yield distributed to regenerative charities accepting MAPLE
3. Yield generation sources:
   - Interest from collateral assets
   - Sell fees (encouraging circular economy)
   - DeFi yield farming strategies

### Community Governance
- Quarterly voting on yield recipient selection
- Transparent reporting on yield generation and distribution
- Open nomination process for funding recipients

## Risk Management Framework

### Collateralization Management
1. **Multi-Asset Backing**: Diversification across Canadian treasury bills, municipal bonds, and community impact bonds
2. **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic trading halts if exchange rates move beyond 5% daily thresholds
3. **Emergency Liquidation Protocols**: Clear processes for crisis scenarios

### Financial Safeguards
1. **Insurance Pool**: 5% of yield dedicated to emergency fund
2. **Gradual Launch**: Supply caps that increase as system proves stable
3. **Stress Testing**: Regular simulations of market shock scenarios

### Trust & Verification
1. **Community Oracle Network**: Multiple trusted community members verify exchange rates
2. **Third-Party Audits**: Regular audits by independent blockchain security firms
3. **Trusted Entity Involvement**:
   - Green Pill Network chapters as validators
   - Indigenous-led organizations for place-based legitimacy
   - Academic institutions for research partnerships
   - Local credit unions for traditional financial bridge-building

## Economic Design Features

### Fee Structure
- Sell fees that support treasury (encourages holding)
- Lower fees for asset-type transactions
- Minimal fees for community-to-community transfers

### Incentive Mechanisms
1. **Holding Rewards**: Yield generation for supporting Canadian regenerative initiatives
2. **Participation Rewards**: $MAPLE awards for active Community Exchange participants
3. **Liquidity Incentives**: Rewards for providing BREAD-$MAPLE liquidity

## Regulatory Approach

### Decentralized Governance
- DAO-based operation bypasses traditional regulatory jurisdiction
- Marshall Islands registration as many crypto projects use
- No direct fiat on-ramps to avoid MSB licensing requirements

### Compliance Considerations
- KYC/AML handled at exchange points (USDC conversion)
- Clear documentation of non-security token status
- Transparency reports for community accountability

## Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6)
- Deploy smart contracts on testnet
- Build $MAPLE-USDC liquidity pools
- Create DAO governance structure
- Engage first trust partners

### Phase 2: Pilot (Months 7-12)
- Launch with supply cap on mainnet
- Integration with first CCC pilots
- Build BREAD-$MAPLE bridges
- Expand trusted validator network

### Phase 3: Growth (Year 2)
- Increase supply caps
- Onboard Canadian asset tokenization partners
- Scale across more CCC implementations
- Build partnerships with Canadian institutions

## Key Success Metrics

1. **Stability**: Maintain CAD peg within 1% deviation
2. **Adoption**: Growing number of CCC pools accepting $MAPLE
3. **Yield Generation**: Consistent returns for holders
4. **Community Impact**: Value distributed to regenerative initiatives
5. **Liquidity**: Healthy BREAD-$MAPLE trading volume

## Vision: National Implications

The ultimate aspiration is for $MAPLE to grow from a community currency into a national infrastructure. As Canadian tokenization matures, the government could:
- Add liquidity to existing $MAPLE pools
- Use $MAPLE for national regenerative initiatives
- Potentially adopt it as a complementary digital currency

### Fractal Scaling Architecture
- BREAD: Umbrella for multiple regional networks (like $MAPLE, SYRUP)
- $MAPLE: Regional layer for London/Ontario
- Local pools: Individual communities
- Sub-pools: Granular divisions within pools

### Emergence-Friendly Design
- $MAPLE could grow from regional to provincial to national
- Architecture allows for organic expansion or federation
- Sub-pools enable deeper local customization
- Naming follows function rather than predetermined hierarchy

This represents a bottom-up approach to national digital currency, starting with communities rather than institutions.

## Technical Specifications (Preliminary)

- **Network**: Initially deploy on Celo for low transaction costs
- **Standard**: ERC-20 compatible token
- **Decimal Places**: 18 (standard)
- **Symbol**: $MAPLE
- **Demurrage**: Potential 0.5-1% annual to encourage circulation
- **Token Type**: CAD-denominated value token (not a security)

## Open Questions

1. Optimal collateralization ratios for Canadian economic conditions
2. Priority order for asset diversification
3. Integration timeline with traditional Canadian financial institutions
4. Governance transition from founding team to full community control
