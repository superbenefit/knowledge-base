# How to Invite a New Member

Bringing new members into our Community Exchange strengthens our network and expands the pool of skills and resources available to everyone. This guide explains the process for inviting others to join our community after your first three months of active participation.

## Understanding the Invitation Process

### Why We Have an Invitation System
- Ensures new members understand and share our community values
- Maintains a manageable growth rate
- Creates accountability through sponsorship
- Builds stronger connections between members

### When You Can Begin Inviting Others
- After three months of active participation
- When you've completed at least 5 exchanges
- After attending at least 2 Connection Circles
- Once you feel confident explaining the system

### Who Makes Good Candidates
- People who demonstrate cooperative values
- Those with complementary skills and resources
- Individuals interested in community building
- People who live in or near London, Ontario
- Those with realistic expectations about participation

## Preparation for Inviting Someone

### 1. Reflect on Their Potential Fit
Before initiating the invitation process, consider:

### 2. Assess Your Relationship
Consider your own connection:
- Do you know them well enough to vouch for them?

- Are you prepared to be their first exchange partner?

### 3. Learn About Their Potential Contributions
- Consider what they might offer to the community
- Think about needs they might fulfill
- Identify their unique skills or resources
- Reflect on how they complement existing offerings

## The Invitation Process
