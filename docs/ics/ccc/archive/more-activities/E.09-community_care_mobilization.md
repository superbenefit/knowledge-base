# Community Care Mobilization

## Purpose
To support members facing health challenges or major life transitions through coordinated care, practical assistance, and emotional support.

## Overview
Community Care Mobilization represents the Community Exchange at its most responsive and compassionate. When a member faces illness, injury, loss, or major life transition, the Exchange activates a coordinated care response that provides tangible support while honoring dignity and agency. This structured approach to community care ensures that support is reliable, appropriate, and sustainable—preventing both gaps in assistance and helper burnout. By formalizing mutual aid through the Exchange system, we strengthen our collective resilience while deepening our commitment to each other's wellbeing.
