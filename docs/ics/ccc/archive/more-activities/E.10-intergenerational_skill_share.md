# Intergenerational Skill Share

## Purpose
To connect across generations, preserve traditional knowledge, share new skills, and strengthen intergenerational relationships within the Community Exchange.

## Overview
The Intergenerational Skill Share creates intentional bridges between generations, recognizing that every age group holds valuable knowledge worth sharing. By pairing older and younger community members as co-teachers, these events honor traditional wisdom while also valuing the insights of youth. This reciprocal learning environment challenges age-based stereotypes, builds meaningful cross-generational relationships, and ensures that important skills and stories continue to live within the community. The knowledge exchange becomes a vehicle for deeper connection, mutual respect, and community continuity.
