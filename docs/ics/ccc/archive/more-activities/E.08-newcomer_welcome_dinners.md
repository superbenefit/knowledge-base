# Newcomer Welcome Dinners

## Purpose
To integrate new members, build initial relationships, create connections between newcomers and established members, and foster a sense of belonging within the Community Exchange.

## Overview
Newcomer Welcome Dinners are intentionally designed gatherings that bridge the gap between formal orientation and active participation in the Community Exchange. Sharing food creates a natural context for connection, while thoughtful facilitation ensures meaningful interactions beyond small talk. These dinners help newcomers find their place in the community, establish initial relationships that can lead to exchanges, and understand the culture of the Exchange in practice rather than just in theory. By mixing established and new members, these dinners also keep the community dynamic and prevent the formation of closed circles.
