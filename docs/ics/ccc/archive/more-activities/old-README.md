The index file (E.00-activities.md) has been updated to include all activities, and the original D.04-community_activities.md file has been emptied (as we plan to delete it).

All activities follow a consistent format that includes:
- Purpose
- Overview
- Format details
- Session flow
- Credit dynamics
- Adaptations
- Implementation resources

These detailed activity guides serve as practical resources for communities implementing the Community Exchange system.
