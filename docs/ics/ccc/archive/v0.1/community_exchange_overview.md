# Community Exchange: Connecting Curiosity and Commitment in London

## Introduction

Community Exchange is a local economic system that combines relationship-building with resource sharing. It creates a space where people can both connect through their interests and skills (Connection Circles) and support each other through a structured exchange of services and resources (Commitment Pool).

Unlike conventional economic systems that rely solely on money, Community Exchange harnesses our community's abundance—our time, skills, knowledge, and resources—creating resilience through mutual support and reciprocity.

Inspired by traditional practices like rotating labor systems and modern approaches like commitment pooling (from Grassroots Economics), this system allows us to:

- Create value without relying solely on scarce cash
- Build deeper community connections through mutual aid
- Share skills and resources that might otherwise remain untapped
- Foster local resilience in an uncertain economic landscape

## Core Components

The Community Exchange consists of two interconnected elements:

1. **Connection Circles**: Community gatherings where people share what they want to learn and what they can teach or offer. These sessions build trust, uncover hidden talents, and spark collaborations.

2. **Commitment Pool**: A shared resource system where members formalize offers of goods and services, earn credits for contributions, and can redeem those credits within the community network.

## How It Works

1. Members join through invitation and orientation
2. Each person identifies what they can offer and what they need
3. Commitments are recorded in our shared ledger
4. As members fulfill commitments, they earn credits
5. Credits can be used to receive services or goods from other members
6. Regular gatherings strengthen relationships and evolve the system
