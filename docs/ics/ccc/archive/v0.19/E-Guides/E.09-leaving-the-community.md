# Leaving the Community Exchange

We understand that life circumstances may require you to leave the Community Exchange. This guide explains the process and requirements for departing in a way that maintains fairness for all members.

## Exit Requirements

### 1. Credit Balance Review

Before departing, you'll need to review your credit balance:

- **Positive Balance**: You may keep any positive credits you've earned
  - These represent value you've already provided to the community
  - You're entitled to retain them as recognition of your contributions

- **Negative Balance**: You must fulfill all issued credits (debts) before leaving
  - Negative balances represent services you've promised but not yet delivered
  - Unfulfilled negative balances harm other members by creating worthless credits
  - This requirement protects the integrity of the system for all members

### 2. Fulfillment Options

If you have a negative balance, you have several options:

1. **Direct Service**: Provide the services you've committed to before departing
2. **Alternative Arrangements**: Work with affected members to find suitable substitutes
3. **Community Service**: Contribute equivalent value through community projects
4. **Settlement**: In exceptional circumstances, discuss alternative resolution with stewards

### 3. Exit Process

Here's the step-by-step process for leaving:

1. **Notify Stewards**: Contact the steward group about your intention to leave
2. **Balance Review**: Work with stewards to review your current balance
3. **Fulfillment Plan**: If you have negative balances, create a plan to fulfill them
4. **Grace Period**: Complete all outstanding commitments within an agreed timeframe
5. **Final Review**: Stewards confirm all obligations are met
6. **Account Closure**: Your account is closed after all requirements are satisfied

### 4. Special Considerations

**Emergency Circumstances**
- If you must leave urgently due to crisis or emergency
- Contact stewards immediately to discuss exceptional arrangements
- The community may vote on special dispensation in rare cases

**Return to Community**
- You may rejoin the community later
- Previous positive balances can be restored
- You start fresh with zero negative balance

**Partial Participation**
- Instead of leaving completely, consider reducing activity
- You can maintain membership with minimal participation
- Keep connections without active credit exchanges

## Why These Requirements Matter

The exit protocol ensures:
- Fair treatment for all members
- Protection of community trust
- Sustainability of the credit system
- Maintenance of reciprocity values

## Support During Exit

Leaving doesn't mean losing connections:
- You remain welcome at community gatherings
- Connection Circle relationships can continue
- The community values your contributions
- Re-entry is always possible when circumstances allow
