## Step 2: Contact the Provider

### Phase 1

1. **Choose Your Contact Method**

   - Options may include email, phone, or text (based on provider preference)

2. **Craft a Clear Request**
   - Identify yourself as a Community Exchange member
   - Specify exactly which commitment you're interested in
   - Indicate when you would like to receive it
   - Be clear about any specific details or questions

   **Example Message:**
   ```

   I'm reaching out through the Community Exchange about your offering of [specific commitment]. I'd like to request [details] on [date/time if relevant]. Would this be possible? I have [X] credits in my balance to exchange for this.
   
   Thanks,
   [Your Name]
   ```

### Phase 2

1. **Use the In-App Request System**
   - Click on the specific commitment you're interested in
   - Select "Request This" button
   - Complete the request form with:
     - Preferred date/time
     - Specific details about your request
     - Any questions or special considerations

2. **Submit and Track**
   - Submit your request through the system
   - You'll receive a notification when the provider responds

## Step 3: Arrange Details

   - Follow any guidelines they've established

3. **Engage Fully**
   - Be attentive and appreciative
   - Provide any needed information or support
   - Create a positive exchange environment

## Step 5: Record the Exchange

### Phase 1

1. **Notify a Steward**
   - Email the designated exchange recording steward
   - Use the subject line: "Exchange Completed"
   - Include these details:
     - Provider's name
     - Your name (receiver)
     - Date of exchange
     - Commitment provided
     - Credit amount
     - Any notes or feedback

2. **Confirmation**
   - The steward will update the ledger
   - You'll receive confirmation when processed
   - Changes should appear in the Credit Balance sheet within 48 hours

### Phase 2

1. **Confirm Completion in the App**
   - After receiving the service/good, log into Sarafu.Network
   - Go to "My Requests" or "Pending Exchanges"
   - Select the exchange and mark it "Completed"
   - The provider will also need to confirm completion

2. **Automatic Processing**
   - Credits will transfer automatically once both parties confirm
   - Your balance will update immediately
   - The exchange will appear in your transaction history

3. **Optional Feedback**
   - Rate your experience if the system allows
   - Provide constructive feedback
   - This helps improve the quality of offerings

## Tips for Successful Requests

- **Plan Ahead**: Allow sufficient time for responses and coordination
- **Be Specific**: Clearly communicate what you need and when
- **Be Flexible**: Remember providers are community members with their own schedules
- **Communicate Promptly**: Respond to messages in a timely manner
- **Show Appreciation**: Express gratitude for the exchange
- **Honor the Agreement**: Don't request additions or extensions beyond what was agreed
- **Give Feedback**: Constructive feedback helps improve the system for everyone
- **Reciprocate**: Consider how you might contribute back to the pool

## What If Things Don't Go as Planned?

- **Provider Doesn't Respond**: If you don't hear back within 48 hours, contact a steward
- **Need to Cancel**: Give as much notice as possible and communicate directly
- **Quality Concerns**: Discuss directly with the provider first; if unresolved, speak with a steward
- **Misunderstandings**: Refer back to the original commitment description and communicate openly
- **Credit Disputes**: Contact a steward for mediation if needed

Remember, the Community Exchange works best when we approach each interaction with patience, clear communication, and goodwill!
