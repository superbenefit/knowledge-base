# How to Track Your Voucher Balance

This guide explains how to monitor your commitment vouchers and transactions within the Community Connection & Commitment Commons system. Staying aware of your balance helps you plan your exchanges and maintain a healthy relationship with the community.

## Phase 1: Google Sheets System

### Accessing Your Balance
1. **Open the shared Voucher Balance sheet**
   - Use the link sent during your onboarding
   - Bookmark the page for easy access
   - The sheet is view-only for regular members (only stewards can edit)

2. **Finding Your Information**
   - Locate your name in the alphabetical member list
   - Your row contains all your transaction history and current balance
   - Look for the highlighted "Current Balance" column

3. **Understanding the Information**
   - **Current Balance**: Your available vouchers (can be positive or negative)
   - **Vouchers Earned**: Total vouchers received from others
   - **Vouchers Spent**: Total vouchers given to others
   - **Transaction History**: List of all exchanges with dates and descriptions

4. **Balance Limitations**
   - Remember your voucher limit (typically ±40 vouchers)
   - If approaching your limit, consider ways to balance your activities
   - Contact a steward if you need to discuss your limit

### Tracking Recent Transactions
1. **Check the Transaction Ledger**
   - Open the separate Transaction Ledger sheet
   - Filter by your name to see your recent activity
   - Transactions are listed chronologically

2. **Reconciling Discrepancies**
   - If you notice missing or incorrect transactions
   - Note the details (date, description, amount, parties involved)
   - Contact a steward with this information
   - Attend the next Connection Circle to discuss if needed

3. **Update Frequency**
   - Balances are updated by stewards
   - Typically within 48 hours of a reported exchange
   - Major updates after Connection Circles and events

### Requesting Transaction Reports
1. **Monthly Summary**
   - Email a steward requesting your transaction summary
   - Specify the time period you're interested in
   - Allow 2-3 days for response

2. **Custom Reports**
   - For specific reporting needs, contact the steward circle
   - Explain the information you need and why
   - Custom reports may take longer to prepare
