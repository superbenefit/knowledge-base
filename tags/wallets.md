*A digital wallet in the Web3 context is a software or hardware interface that allows users to manage their cryptographic key pairs, sign transactions, and interact with blockchain networks. It acts as a primary tool for identity, asset management, and participation in decentralized systems like DAOs.*

Often misunderstood as a place where digital assets are "stored," a wallet does not actually hold cryptocurrencies or tokens. Instead, the assets exist on the blockchain, and the wallet holds the private keys necessary to authorize transactions and prove ownership of those assets. This distinction is crucial: controlling the keys means controlling the assets. This makes the security and management of wallets fundamental to user sovereignty in decentralized ecosystems.

Wallets are the primary user-facing tool for interacting with the decentralized web. They serve as a login mechanism for dApps (decentralized applications), a portal for participating in governance, and a secure vault for digital identity credentials. Non-custodial wallets, where the user has sole control over their private keys, embody the Web3 principle of self-sovereignty, removing reliance on intermediaries to manage one's digital presence and property.

## Uses of "Wallets"

### As an Interface for DAO Participation

In the context of [DAOs](tags/daos.md), a wallet is the primary tool for members. It holds the governance tokens that represent voting power, allows users to connect to DAO front-ends, and enables them to sign transactions to vote on proposals or claim rewards. It is the user's gateway to exercising their rights and responsibilities within the organization, serving as both an ID card and a voting booth.

### As a Tool for Governance

For [decentralized governance](tags/governance.md), a wallet is the instrument of action. It cryptographically proves ownership of the assets or credentials required for participation. All governance actions, from creating a proposal to casting a vote, are initiated and authorized through a wallet signature, ensuring that actions are verifiably tied to a specific participant and their corresponding stake or role.

### As a Controller of Personal Resources

From a [resources](tags/resources.md) perspective, a non-custodial wallet gives an individual agent complete control over their private on-chain assets. These resources—whether cryptocurrencies, NFTs, or governance rights—are secured by the wallet's private keys. This turns the wallet into a personal vault and a key tool for self-sovereignty in the digital economy, allowing users to manage their assets without permission from a central authority.
