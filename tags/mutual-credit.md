_Mutual credit is an exchange system where currency is created at the time of transactions as corresponding credits and debits in participant accounts, enabling [community](community.md) to facilitate trade and resource sharing without requiring external money supply, interest-bearing debt, or centralized banking infrastructure._

In mutual credit systems, participants function simultaneously as both creditors and debtors to each other, with all transactions recorded on a shared ledger that tracks the balance of credits and debits for each member. Unlike conventional monetary systems where currency must be borrowed into existence or issued by central authorities, mutual credit creates the medium of exchange through the act of trade itself—when someone provides goods or services to another community member, they receive credits while the recipient incurs an equivalent debit. This approach eliminates the need for participants to possess existing money before engaging in exchanges, instead creating liquidity through community agreement and mutual accountability.

Mutual credit systems operate on principles of reciprocity and community self-[governance](governance.md), establishing agreed-upon units of account and credit limits that enable participants to contribute to and draw from a common pool of resources and services. These systems build local economic resilience by keeping value circulating within community rather than extracting it to external institutions, while creating transparent and democratic alternatives to conventional banking that can function independently of broader financial systems during economic disruptions or in contexts where traditional banking is inaccessible or inappropriate.

## Uses of "Mutual Credit"

### Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS)

LETS enable community members to trade without requiring conventional money by creating credits through transactions themselves. When Sarah provides tutoring to John, she earns credits while John incurs debits—the currency is created through the exchange.

Example: In Ithaca, New York, the Ithaca HOURS system allowed members to earn local credits for services like babysitting or computer repair, then spend those credits for organic groceries or medical care. As noted in Grassroots Economics, these systems create "functional economic relationships based on reciprocity rather than accumulation," enabling access to goods and services even when conventional money is scarce.

### Time Banking and Service Exchange

Time banks apply mutual credit where one hour of any service equals one time credit, regardless of skill level. This creates egalitarian systems recognizing all contributions as equally valuable.

Example: In Tokyo, elderly residents earn time credits by helping with shopping, then use those credits for home care assistance. Grassroots Economics notes how time banking can "formalize and expand informal networks of mutual aid," creating sustainable community care systems. In Kenya's Sarafu Network, community track labor commitments through digital vouchers that function similarly—members contribute work hours and can access equivalent support from their network.

### Business and Commercial Credit Clearing

Commercial mutual credit systems enable businesses to trade with each other using credits rather than cash, creating liquidity for business-to-business transactions during periods when conventional financing is constrained or expensive. These systems operate through credit clearing exchanges that facilitate transactions between member businesses while maintaining transparent accounting of credits and debits.

Business credit clearing demonstrates how mutual credit principles can operate at commercial scale, enabling enterprises to maintain operations and fulfill contracts even during cash flow shortages. These systems create resilient business networks that can continue functioning during banking disruptions while reducing reliance on interest-bearing debt and external financing, showing how mutual credit can serve both social and commercial functions within the same conceptual framework.

### Mutual Credit in Web3 and [Blockchain](blockchain.md) Systems

Web3 technologies enable new implementations of mutual credit that combine traditional principles with blockchain [transparency](transparency.md), global accessibility, and automated rule enforcement through smart contracts. Blockchain-based mutual credit systems can operate across geographic boundaries while maintaining the democratic governance and community accountability that characterize traditional mutual credit approaches.

These systems can integrate with other Web3 applications and [decentralized](decentralization.md) finance (DeFi) platforms while maintaining their distinct focus on creating value through reciprocal exchange rather than speculative trading or yield generation. Smart contracts can automate the accounting and enforcement of mutual credit rules while preserving community control over system parameters, creating hybrid systems that benefit from both technological capabilities and social [coordination](coordination.md) mechanisms.

### Community Resilience and Alternative Economics

Mutual credit systems build community resilience by creating economic infrastructure that communities can control and maintain independently of external financial institutions. During economic crises, natural disasters, or other disruptions to conventional financial systems, mutual credit networks can continue facilitating essential exchanges and maintaining community economic activity.

These systems embody principles of economic democracy by giving communities direct control over their exchange mechanisms rather than depending on distant institutions with different priorities. Mutual credit creates pathways for communities to develop economic self-determination while maintaining connections to broader economic systems, enabling both local resilience and wider [participation](participation.md) as communities choose.

## Mutual Credit and Cooperative Economics

Mutual credit systems align closely with cooperative principles of democratic ownership, participatory governance, and equitable distribution of benefits. Like cooperatives, mutual credit systems distribute both economic benefits and [decision-making](decision-making.md) [power](power.md) across participants rather than concentrating them in external owners or centralized authorities.

The governance structures of mutual credit systems often mirror cooperative democracy, with participants collectively establishing rules, resolving disputes, and adapting system parameters through democratic processes. This alignment makes mutual credit systems natural complements to cooperative enterprises, creating broader ecosystems of cooperative economic relationships that can support each other during challenges and amplify collective impact.
