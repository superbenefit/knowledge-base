*Actions are occurrences or processes initiated by individuals or systems that result in a change or impact on a given situation, environment, or system.* ^9a4c53

Actions represent the bridge between intention and realization in any system. They transform abstract goals, decisions, and plans into tangible outcomes that advance an organization's purpose. In decentralized contexts, actions gain additional significance as they operate without centralized control, instead being guided by shared agreements, protocols, and autonomous decision-making.

Within the DAO ecosystem, actions serve as the fundamental units of productivity and change, whether executed by individuals, teams, or automated processes. These discrete operations collectively create the movement, transformation, and flow of resources, information, and value that animate organizational systems. Understanding how actions are initiated, coordinated, and evaluated provides insight into how decentralized networks maintain coherence while enabling autonomy.

## Uses of "Actions"

### Actions in Organization and Systems Design

In the context of organization and systems design, actions are the measurable processes or events through which resources are created, exchanged, or transformed, driving the flow of value within the system. ^a16991

Organizations can be understood as networks of coordinated actions that allow disparate individuals to work together toward shared purposes. How these actions are structured, permitted, and recorded determines an organization's effectiveness, adaptability, and alignment with its goals. In traditional organizations, actions typically flow from top-down direction, while decentralized systems develop mechanisms for autonomous action within agreed frameworks.

### Actions in DAOs and Web3

In decentralized autonomous organizations, actions manifest through multiple mechanisms:

- **On-chain actions**: Transactions, votes, and interactions with smart contracts that are cryptographically verified and permanently recorded on the blockchain
- **Coordination actions**: Communications, decisions, and agreements that coordinate activity across autonomous teams or [cells](artifacts/patterns/cell.md)
- **Contributory actions**: Tasks and deliverables created by community members that advance the DAO's purpose
- **Governance actions**: Processes like proposals, voting, and [delegation](tags/delegation.md) that shape the direction and rules of the organization

What distinguishes actions in DAOs is their permissionless nature combined with transparent accountability. As noted in Minimum Viable Permissionless-ness, the ability for participants to take autonomous action without prior approval—while still being accountable to the network—is fundamental to generating decentralized intelligence.

### Actions in Social Impact

In social impact contexts, actions focus on creating measurable positive change in communities, environments, or systems. These actions balance the need for immediate intervention with long-term transformation, often incorporating:

- **Mutual aid actions**: Direct support and resource sharing within communities
- **Capacity building actions**: Activities that strengthen community resilience and capabilities
- **Advocacy actions**: Efforts to transform structures and policies that create or perpetuate harm
- **Regenerative actions**: Interventions that restore and enhance social and ecological systems

The Reimagining Power initiative specifically examines how web3 technologies can enable more equitable, community-driven action by redistributing power and resources to those most affected by social challenges.

## Related Concepts

Actions connect to numerous other concepts in the knowledge base:

- **[Tasks](tags/tasks.md)**: Structured units of work that organize action toward specific deliverables
- **[Decisions](tags/decisions.md)**: Choice-making processes that determine which actions to take
- **Execution**: The process of carrying actions to completion
- **Evaluation**: Assessment of actions and their outcomes
- **[Agreements](tags/agreements.md)**: Shared understandings that guide and constrain actions
- **[Permissions](tags/permissions.md)**: Rights that enable or limit certain types of actions
- **[Resources](tags/resources.md)**: Assets transformed or deployed through actions

Together, these concepts form an interconnected framework for understanding how purposeful activity emerges, operates, and evolves within decentralized systems.
