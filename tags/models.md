Models are structured frameworks or representations used to simplify and understand complex systems, processes, or behaviors, providing guidance for analysis, decision-making, and problem-solving.

## Uses of "Models"

In the context of Web3 and systems design, models refer to structured representations of processes, interactions, or organizational dynamics that guide decision-making, resource allocation, and coordination within decentralized social and technological frameworks, providing a blueprint for how various components like agents, tasks, and protocols interact to achieve system goals.
