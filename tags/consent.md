This is a definition of "consent" as the core principle in Consent Based Decision-making.

Consent is a principle where a proposal or action can proceed when no participant raises a reasoned, substantial objection that the proposal would harm the organization's ability to achieve its purpose or prevent a member from fulfilling their role. Unlike consensus which requires active agreement from all parties, consent focuses on the absence of valid objections. This enables more efficient decision-making while still protecting against harmful changes and maintaining alignment with organizational goals.

In DAO contexts, consent operates as a coordination primitive that balances autonomy with collective wellbeing - allowing maximum freedom of action while providing safeguards against decisions that could damage the network's ability to function effectively.
