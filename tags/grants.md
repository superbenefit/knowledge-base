**Grants** are financial awards given by governments, organizations, or institutions to support specific projects, research, or initiatives, typically without the expectation of repayment, to advance goals in areas such as education, innovation, or community development.

In Web3, grants are decentralized, often community-governed financial contributions aimed at funding public goods, projects, or initiatives that align with the values of transparency, inclusivity, and open-source development.
