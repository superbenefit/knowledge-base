*The safeguarding of personal, transactional, and organizational data to ensure individual and collective autonomy, security, and ethical stewardship in digital ecosystems.*

Privacy encompasses the protection and responsible management of information across digital and physical domains. It forms a foundational pillar for trust, self-determination, and freedom in networked systems. Beyond simple data protection, privacy represents a core value that enables authentic participation, safe collaboration, and equitable power dynamics in decentralized communities.

In purpose-driven networks, privacy serves both protective and generative functions: shielding vulnerable participants from harm while creating spaces where genuine innovation, trust, and community-building can flourish without surveillance or coercion.

## Uses of "Privacy"

### Privacy in Web3

In the web3 context, privacy refers to the protection of users' identities, transactions, and activities in decentralized systems. It ensures that individuals maintain control over their data while benefiting from transparency and trustless interactions.

Privacy in web3 often involves technologies such as:
- **Zero-knowledge proofs**: Allowing verification without revealing underlying information
- **Decentralized identifiers (DIDs)**: Enabling selective disclosure of identity attributes
- **Privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies**: Supporting confidential transactions
- **Encryption protocols**: Securing communications and stored data

These technologies balance anonymity with accountability, creating systems where users can participate safely without surrendering their personal information to centralized authorities or exposing themselves to surveillance.

### Privacy in Social Impact

For social impact initiatives, privacy is often a critical requirement rather than a luxury. When working with marginalized communities, whistleblowers, or in politically sensitive contexts, privacy becomes essential for:

- **Safety**: Protecting individuals from reprisal or targeting
- **Agency**: Allowing communities to control their own narratives and data
- **Equity**: Preventing exploitation of vulnerable populations
- **Trust**: Creating safe spaces for authentic participation

The Privacy-Preserving Crypto Payments pattern exemplifies how privacy technologies can support humanitarian work in challenging environments, enabling resource distribution while protecting participant identities.

### Privacy as Collective Responsibility

Privacy is increasingly understood as both an individual right and a collective responsibility. In networked systems:

- Individual privacy choices affect the privacy of others in the network
- Community governance must establish shared norms around data practices
- Privacy design requires consideration of power dynamics and potential harms
- Technical solutions must be complemented by social agreements and practices

This perspective shifts privacy from a purely individual concern to an essential component of [governance](tags/governance.md) and [coordination-scale](artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-scale/coordination-scale.md) in decentralized systems.

## Related Concepts

Privacy intersects with numerous other concepts in the lexicon:

- **[Autonomy](tags/autonomy.md)**: Privacy enables genuine self-determination and agency
- **[Decentralization](tags/decentralization.md)**: Distributing data and control reduces centralized surveillance
- **[Consent](tags/consent.md)**: Privacy requires meaningful permission for data usage
- **Trust**: Privacy protections foster confidence in systems and communities
- **Security**: Privacy and security are complementary but distinct requirements

Understanding these relationships helps create more holistic approaches to privacy in system design and governance.
