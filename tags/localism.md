*An organizational philosophy and practice that emphasizes local autonomy, community self-determination, and place-based solutions while maintaining beneficial connections to broader networks and resources.*

Localism represents a response to excessive centralization and globalization, seeking to rebuild community resilience and autonomy while preserving valuable external connections. It focuses on organizing human activity around natural boundaries (like watersheds and bioregions) rather than arbitrary political divisions, while developing local capacity for governance, production, and cultural expression.

## Uses of "Localism"

### Localism in Economics

In economic contexts, localism promotes local production and consumption cycles, community-owned infrastructure, and economic systems that serve local needs. This includes developing local currencies, mutual credit systems, and community-based financial institutions that keep resources circulating within the community.

### Localism in Governance

In governance, localism emphasizes democratic self-determination at the local level, with communities making decisions about issues that directly affect them. This often involves participatory democracy, commons management, and collective stewardship of shared resources.

### Localism in Ecology

In ecological contexts, localism focuses on organizing human activity in harmony with local ecosystems and bioregions. This includes sustainable resource management, regenerative agriculture, and ecological restoration guided by local knowledge and conditions.

### Localism in web3

In web3 contexts, localism has evolved beyond traditional emphasis on self-sufficiency to embrace what's known as [cosmolocalism](tags/cosmolocalism.md) - a hybrid approach that maintains local [autonomy](tags/autonomy.md) while leveraging global networks. This evolution represents an important adaptation to modern technological capabilities:

- Traditional localism focuses on local self-sufficiency and independence from external systems
- Web3 tools enable a more nuanced approach where communities can:
    - Maintain sovereignty over local resources and decision-making
    - Share knowledge and protocols globally through open systems
    - Connect local initiatives through decentralized networks
    - Access global capital while preserving local control
    - Coordinate between autonomous groups without centralization
    - Support place-based governance with digital tools

The key innovation is the ability to choose the optimal scale for different activities - keeping production and governance local while participating in global knowledge and resource networks. This follows the cosmo-local principle of "heavy is local, light is global," enabling communities to benefit from broader connections without sacrificing autonomy.
