_Resources are assets, materials, or capabilities that enable action, including tangible elements like funds and equipment as well as intangible elements like knowledge, time, and attention, all of which can be allocated toward achieving specific goals and outcomes._ ^22f819

Resources form the foundation of all organizational systems, determining what actions are possible and how effectively goals can be pursued. In decentralized systems, resources take on particular importance as their distribution, governance, and flow directly shape power dynamics and operational capabilities. The way resources are managed—whether centralized under hierarchical control or distributed through networked governance—fundamentally influences what outcomes are possible and who benefits from them.

Web3 systems introduce new paradigms for resource management through mechanisms like programmable treasuries, tokenization of previously non-financialized assets, and transparent on-chain tracking of resource flows. These innovations enable more participatory approaches to resource allocation while creating new challenges around coordination, security, and alignment between individual and collective interests.

## Uses of "Resources"

### DAO Primitives Framework

In the DAO Primitives Framework, resources are fundamental building blocks that enable coordinated action. They include financial assets (like treasury funds), technical infrastructure, community attention, and knowledge capabilities that DAOs can leverage to achieve their purpose. The framework emphasizes that effective resource allocation through transparent and participatory processes is essential for decentralized organizations to coordinate efficiently across different scales.

### [Anticapture](links/Anticapture.md)

In [Anticapture](links/Anticapture.md), _resources_ are defined as anything that can be used to achieve desired outcomes, including tangible assets like food, money, and energy, as well as intangible ones like attention and social reputation. The term distinguishes between _private resources_, controlled by a single [agents](tags/agents.md), and _shared resources_, governed by a network of agents. Shared resources are particularly vulnerable to capture, making decentralized governance essential to protect them from misuse or control by bad actors

### In Web3 Governance

In [governance](tags/governance.md) systems, resources provide both the means and often the focus of collective decision-making. The allocation of treasuries, deployment of technical infrastructure, and cultivation of community attention all require governance mechanisms that can effectively direct resources toward [purpose](tags/purpose.md)-aligned activities. Effective resource management in DAOs requires balancing flexibility for rapid action with appropriate controls to prevent misuse or exploitation.

### In Social Impact DAOs

For organizations focused on social impact, resources extend beyond financial capital to include relationships, environmental assets, and social capital. Impact-oriented DAOs often develop innovative resource management systems that blend traditional approaches with web3 mechanisms like quadratic funding, [impact certificates](tags/impact.md), and regenerative economics to more effectively direct resources toward sustainable outcomes that transcend financial returns.
