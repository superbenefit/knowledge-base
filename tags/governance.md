Decentralized governance in the context of Web3 and [DAOs](tags/daos.md) refers to the [decentralized](tags/decentralization.md), [blockchain](tags/blockchain.md)-based system where rules, [decisions](tags/decisions.md), and resource allocation are managed collectively by participants through transparent, automated mechanisms like smart contracts. Rather than concentrating decision-making power in a traditional hierarchy, decentralized governance distributes authority across different scales and functions of the organization.

## Types of Governance

### [Community Governance](artifacts/patterns/community-governance.md)

Operates at Constituency Scale to safeguard and evolve the network's overarching purpose. Community governance includes a broad base of stakeholders who may not be directly involved in operations but are aligned with the network's purpose. It uses slower, more deliberative mechanisms like conviction voting and optimistic governance to make long-term decisions about network direction and treasury allocation.

### [Operational Governance](artifacts/patterns/operational-governance.md)

Functions at Coordination Scale to enable effective day-to-day operations and resource allocation. Built on sociocratic structures where Cells (small autonomous teams) coordinate their activities. Operational governance provides the flexibility and autonomy needed for teams to execute effectively while maintaining coordination across the network.

### [multi-stakeholder-governance](notes/dao-primitives/implementation/patterns/constituency-scale-patterns/multi-stakeholder-governance.md)

Focuses on aligning key stakeholder interests and managing relationships between different participants in the network. This includes coordinating between active contributors, token holders, users, and other parties who have a direct stake in the network's success. Stakeholder governance helps balance competing interests while maintaining alignment with the network's purpose.
