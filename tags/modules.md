**Modules** are self-contained, interchangeable units or components that perform specific functions within a larger system, allowing for flexibility, customization, and scalability when building or modifying that system.

## Uses of "Modules"

The term *modules* is used across various contexts to describe different types of self-contained components: in organizational design, they represent functional units of processes or teams; in grassroots movements and nonprofit organizations, they refer to adaptable, repeatable strategies or tools for mobilization; in coordination systems, they enable flexible collaboration structures; and in blockchain technology, they are units of code or governance mechanisms that can be independently developed, deployed, and integrated into larger systems for decentralized management.

### Modules in systems and org design

In the context of organization and systems design, *modules* are configurable, self-contained components that perform specific governance functions, which can be combined and modified to form larger, more complex systems.

Modules allow for flexibility in designing organizational processes by enabling users to select and arrange different components to meet their needs. These components can operate independently or in combination with others, facilitating customization and scalability. In decentralized systems, such as those found in Web3, modules support interoperability and portability, allowing governance tools to be shared across different platforms and adapted to new contexts efficiently.
