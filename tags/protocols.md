**Protocols** are standardized sets of rules or procedures, both digital (like blockchain communication frameworks) and social (like governance models), that enable coordinated actions and interactions among participants within decentralized systems or networks.

In the context of Web3 and organizational or systems design, protocols are standardized sets of rules and procedures that govern both social and technological interactions, enabling decentralized coordination, secure communication, and structured decision-making across networks and organizations.
