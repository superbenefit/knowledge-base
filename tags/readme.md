*Shared vocabulary and conceptual frameworks - the building blocks of collective knowledge.*

# Tags Directory

This directory contains our shared vocabulary and conceptual frameworks - the building blocks of our collective knowledge. Tags are both categories and concepts that help organize and connect ideas across our knowledge base.

Tag pages in this directory:
- Define key terms and ideas
- Explain relationships between concepts
- Link to relevant content across the knowledge base
- Evolve with our understanding and knowledge development

Our tagging system supports:
- Organizing content by theme or topic
- Navigating complex, interconnected ideas
- Developing shared language and models
- Identifying patterns and areas for further research

To contribute to our tagging system:
1. Reference existing tags where relevant
2. Propose new tags as needed to categorize content
3. Develop tag pages to refine definitions and connections
4. Use tags liberally to create a rich web of knowledge

Tags are the connective tissue of our second brain - let's cultivate them wisely.
