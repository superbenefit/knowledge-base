_Sustainability refers to the design and implementation of systems that balance environmental integrity, social equity, and economic viability to meet present needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet their own needs, particularly through [decentralized](decentralization.md) [coordination](coordination.md) mechanisms that enable regenerative rather than extractive relationships._

In the context of Web3 and [decentralized](decentralization.md) systems, sustainability extends beyond traditional environmental concerns to encompass the resilience, longevity, and regenerative capacity of sociotechnical networks. These systems aim to create positive-sum outcomes by aligning incentives toward long-term value creation rather than short-term extraction. Sustainable approaches in this domain recognize the interdependence between ecological health, social wellbeing, and economic prosperity, seeking to design [coordination](coordination.md) mechanisms that naturally regenerate rather than deplete the resources upon which they depend.

The shift toward sustainability in [decentralized](decentralization.md) networks involves reimagining fundamental structures and incentives to prioritize long-term resilience over immediate efficiency. This includes developing [governance](governance.md) models, economic systems, and technological infrastructures that internalize externalities, distribute benefits equitably, and remain adaptable to changing conditions. By making sustainability a core design principle rather than an afterthought, these systems can help address urgent global challenges while creating more viable paths for human cooperation and flourishing.

## Uses of "Sustainability"

### Sustainability in Web3 and [Blockchain](blockchain.md)

In Web3 contexts, sustainability addresses both the environmental impacts of [blockchain](blockchain.md) technologies and the long-term viability of decentralized networks. This includes developing energy-efficient [consensus](consensus.md) mechanisms to reduce carbon footprints, creating tokenomics models that support ongoing maintenance and development, and ensuring that protocols can evolve without compromising core [values](values.md) or security.

The sustainability challenges of early proof-of-work blockchains have driven innovation toward more energy-efficient alternatives like proof-of-stake, as well as layer-2 solutions that reduce computational overhead. Beyond environmental concerns, sustainable Web3 systems also focus on [governance](governance.md) mechanisms that prevent capture by short-term interests, enabling networks to make decisions that preserve their long-term viability and purpose alignment.

### Sustainability in DAO Design

For Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, sustainability involves creating structures and processes that can endure and evolve while maintaining alignment with core purpose. As described in Building [DAOs](daos.md) as scalable networks, sustainable [DAOs](daos.md) leverage both sub-linear scaling dynamics (for efficiency) and super-linear social network effects (for innovation), creating positive feedback loops similar to those that allow cities to thrive over centuries.

Unlike traditional organizations that often decay and die as their infrastructure becomes rigid, sustainable [DAOs](daos.md) design for adaptability, incorporating mechanisms for renewal and regeneration. As noted in Scale and the levers that provide DAOs their [power](power.md): "Like cities, leveraging Dynamics One & Two, DAO networks can benefit from the same positive feedback loops as they grow. Increasing economies of scale make them powerful, while constant creativity, innovation and responsiveness keep them alive and relevant to a changing world."

### Sustainability in [Community](community.md) [Governance](governance.md)

In [community](community.md) and network [governance](governance.md), sustainability focuses on creating [decision-making](decision-making.md) processes that can balance immediate needs with long-term stewardship. This involves developing governance models that distribute [power](power.md) appropriately, create accountability for outcomes, and enable [community](community.md) to adapt to changing circumstances while maintaining core [values](values.md).

As explored in Governance for better futures - New and Old, sustainable governance approaches often draw from traditional wisdom and indigenous perspectives that emphasize intergenerational responsibility: "We descend from the earth and that's who we have to give back to because it will sustain us for the rest of our lives and future generations." These approaches prioritize relationships with place and [community](community.md), seeing sustainability not as an abstract goal but as a lived practice of reciprocity and care.

### Sustainability in Social Impact

In social impact contexts, sustainability focuses on creating lasting positive change through interventions that address root causes rather than symptoms. This includes developing resource models that support ongoing work, building local capacity rather than creating dependency, and ensuring that impacts endure beyond initial funding or attention cycles.

Sustainable approaches to social impact often emphasize cosmolocalism, combining "resilient localized production with access to global knowledge commons and [coordination](coordination.md) protocols." This approach builds self-sufficiency at the local level while connecting [community](community.md) to broader networks of resources and knowledge, creating systems that can endure and evolve over time.
