Group state describes the structured capture of essential group information in a way that provides for internal coherence within the group, and the possibility of coordination between the group and other entities in purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams.

## Group state 

The concept of group state is borrowed from computer science. We use “state” to describe the current configuration of an entity at any point in time.

Entities having a clearly defined and interpretable state is fundamental for decentralised coordination to occur. It allows an entity or group to have a coherent accurate view/description of itself that others in the network can engage with.

An entity’s _state_ is a secure, (ideally version-controlled) up-to-date description of the intentions, agreements and activities of an entity that provides a mechanism for others to coordinate with it - e.g discover it, trust it, partner with it, share resources with it etc

An entity or group must maintain its own _state_. This allows the structure of the system to emerge as a _network of small autonomous teams_, rather than relying on state to be maintained (and dictated) by a centralizing structure in the organization. 

From a technical perspective, state will consist of a basket of attestations that make explicit the commitments and agreements that are foundational to a Role, Task or entity.

For example, a task or role contains the agreements about the nature of the task and agreement by the person or entity who is being assigned/accepting the task or role. For a Cell, the _state_ contains the shared agreements held by the core team and also commitments that the team makes to entities outside the Cell. And for a DAO the _state_ is defined by the community agreeing on how the DAO is to operate.

A simple articulation of this _state_ could be covered by the following categories:

1. **Purpose** - what is the goal of the entity, role or task? - What is it trying to achieve and how does this relate to the other entities in the network and the network's overarching purpose?
    
2. **Practice** - how will it achieve its goals? - Who is in it and what roles to they have? How does it make decisions? How is money and other rewards/compensation managed? How is the work of the entity managed?
    
3. **Progress** - what progress has been made? - where are plans, timelines etc and progress through these recorded? Where can outputs, documents, artefacts etc be viewed?

_Group State_ makes decentralized organization possible, because entities and groups can be autonomous/self governing, while also being deeply integrated into larger networks and partnerships via agreements held in their _state._

Group state is also fractal, with Roles and Tasks also having _state_, which rolls up into Cell _states_, and Cell _states_ rolls up into DAO state. In this way, the entire network can be understood simply by looking at the the different group _states_ that it is made up of.
