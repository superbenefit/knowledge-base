_Goals are collectively defined objectives that orient [decision-making](decision-making.md) and guide action toward specific, measurable outcomes while creating alignment between autonomous contributors and shared purpose._

Goals serve as coordinating mechanisms in [decentralized](decentralization.md) systems, providing direction without requiring centralized control. Unlike rigid commands or instructions, goals establish what needs to be achieved while leaving space for creativity and contextual adaptation in how the objectives are met. This balance enables both alignment with collective purpose and [autonomy](autonomy.md) in execution, making goals particularly valuable in networks where direct supervision is neither possible nor desirable.

In organizational contexts, well-designed goals create clarity, focus attention on priorities, and establish common reference points for distributed [decision-making](decision-making.md). They provide the foundation for meaningful evaluation and adaptation, allowing systems to learn and evolve based on observable outcomes rather than adherence to predefined processes. The process of setting, tracking, and revising goals can itself be an important [coordination](coordination.md) mechanism that builds shared understanding and commitment across diverse stakeholders.

## Uses of "Goals"

### Goals in [Decentralized](decentralization.md) Organizations

In [DAOs](daos.md) and other [decentralized](decentralization.md) organizations, goals function as orientation points that enable autonomous teams to align their activities without requiring hierarchical management. These goals often exist at multiple scales, from individual contributor objectives to Cell-level targets to network-wide aspirations.

As described in Building [DAOs](daos.md) as scalable networks, decentralized organizations leverage "autonomous self-organizing groups – all working towards its overarching purpose." Goals provide the practical, concrete manifestations of this purpose, translating abstract missions into actionable objectives that contributors can work toward independently while maintaining coherence with the broader network.

### Goals in [Coordination](coordination.md) Systems

In [coordination](coordination.md) systems, goals serve as shared references that enable distributed decisions and actions to converge toward desired outcomes. Goals articulate specific objectives while leaving space for contextual adaptation in how those objectives are pursued. This approach enables both alignment and [autonomy](autonomy.md), making [coordination](coordination.md) possible without rigid control structures.

The relationship between goals and emergent behavior is bidirectional. While clear goals help orient collective action, the process of pursuing goals often reveals new information that leads to refinement or evolution of the objectives themselves. This adaptive approach recognizes goals as hypotheses to be tested and refined rather than fixed endpoints.

### Goals in Impact Measurement

In social impact contexts, goals provide the foundation for effective measurement and evaluation systems. Well-defined goals establish clarity about intended outcomes, enabling organizations to track progress, demonstrate accountability, and adapt strategies based on observed results.

Impact-oriented goals often incorporate both quantitative metrics and qualitative dimensions to capture the full scope of desired change. This comprehensive approach recognizes that social impact encompasses both measurable outputs and deeper transformations in systems, relationships, and [power](power.md) dynamics that may not be readily quantifiable.
