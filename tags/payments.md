### "Payments" in web3

In a web3 context, payments often leverage blockchain technology, ensuring transparency, traceability, and trust in the flow of resources. These systems can include tokenized contributions, DAO-based disbursements, staking rewards, or impact-driven smart contracts. Within philanthropy and community-driven projects, payments serve to mobilize resources effectively, enabling individuals and groups to contribute to causes that align with their values while reducing barriers like high transaction costs or lack of accountability.
