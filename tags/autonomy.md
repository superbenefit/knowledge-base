_The capacity of individuals, groups, or systems to self-govern, make independent decisions, and act according to their own principles and judgments while remaining accountable for outcomes and participating in larger coordination frameworks._

Autonomy represents a fundamental quality in decentralized systems, balancing independence with interdependence. Unlike complete independence, which suggests isolation, autonomy acknowledges the context of relationships and networks within which self-determination occurs. In organizational and social contexts, autonomy enables distributed decision-making that can respond to local conditions while maintaining alignment with broader purposes and values.

The concept bridges individual agency with collective coordination, creating systems that can harness diverse perspectives and contextual intelligence without requiring top-down control. This quality is essential for creating resilient, adaptive organizations capable of responding to complexity and change while preserving coherence and purpose alignment.

## Uses of "Autonomy"

### Autonomy in Decentralized Organizations

In DAOs and other decentralized organizations, autonomy refers to the ability of individual contributors and teams to make decisions and take actions without requiring approval from a hierarchical management structure. This operational freedom is balanced through alignment mechanisms like shared purpose, transparent agreements, and distributed governance protocols rather than command-and-control directives.

As described in the DAO Primitives framework, DAOs function as "purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams" where each unit maintains decision-making independence while coordinating with others toward shared goals. This creates organizations that can simultaneously achieve focus through small team collaboration while leveraging network-scale coordination.

### Autonomy in Cell-Based Structures

Within the Cell working group pattern, autonomy is a defining characteristic that allows Cells (small teams of fewer than 10 people) to operate with high degrees of freedom while remaining connected to a broader organizational context. These autonomous units maintain internal self-governance while developing agreements with other Cells and the larger network.

This approach creates "networked autonomy" where Cells can make independent decisions about how to achieve their purpose while coordinating with other Cells through transparent state documentation and formal relationships. As described in the Cell working group documentation, this balanced approach "helps realize the benefits of decentralized organization while mitigating common failure modes."

### Autonomy in Community Governance

In the context of localism and community self-determination, autonomy refers to the capacity of communities to govern their own resources, infrastructure, and development according to local needs and values. This concept appears in both localism and cosmolocalism, where it represents a core quality of resilient community systems.

Community autonomy is enhanced rather than diminished by appropriate connections to broader networks. As noted in the cosmolocalism tag, these approaches combine "resilient localized production with access to global knowledge commons and coordination protocols," enabling communities to "maintain autonomy while benefiting from global networks."

### Autonomy in Technology and Privacy

In technological contexts, autonomy is closely linked to privacy and data sovereignty. Privacy-preserving systems enhance autonomy by allowing individuals and organizations to maintain control over their information and digital interactions without surveillance or external manipulation.

This connection is evident in patterns like Privacy-Preserving Crypto Payments, which list autonomy as a key quality. Such systems provide tools for self-determination in contexts where traditional infrastructure might compromise independence or subject users to unwanted control.
