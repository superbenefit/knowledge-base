_Frameworks are structured conceptual models that provide organizing principles, components, and relationships to guide understanding, decision-making, and implementation in complex domains, enabling consistent approaches to recurring challenges without rigid prescription._

Frameworks serve as intellectual scaffolding that bridge theory and practice, offering flexible but coherent structures for approaching complex problems. Unlike rigid methodologies that prescribe specific steps, good frameworks establish foundational principles, key components, and important relationships while leaving room for adaptation to context. They provide cognitive leverage by organizing knowledge and experience into patterns that make complexity more manageable and communicable.

In the context of decentralized systems and social impact, frameworks play a crucial role in translating abstract concepts into practical implementation while maintaining values alignment. They help diverse stakeholders develop shared understanding and coordinate action without centralized control. By making implicit knowledge explicit and transferable, frameworks accelerate learning across communities and enable more effective collaboration across cultural, organizational, and disciplinary boundaries.

## Uses of "Frameworks"

Frameworks serve distinct yet complementary purposes across different domains: in organizational design, they provide structural models for coordination and development; in web3 governance, they offer systematic approaches to power distribution and decision-making; and in social impact, they create navigational tools for addressing complex societal challenges while maintaining values alignment.

### Frameworks in Organization Design

In organizational contexts, frameworks provide structured approaches to governance, coordination, and development. They offer conceptual models for understanding key components and relationships in organizational systems, helping stakeholders visualize complex interactions and design coherent structures.

The [DAO Primitives Framework](artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/index.md) exemplifies this approach, providing foundational concepts and patterns for building decentralized organizations. As noted in the knowledge base, this framework explores how DAOs function as "purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams" and offers tools for facilitating group development across different phases and scales. This framework helps practitioners design organizations that balance autonomy with coordination, creating systems that can scale while maintaining alignment with core purpose.

### Frameworks in Web3 Governance

In web3 governance, frameworks provide structured approaches to addressing coordination challenges, power dynamics, and decision-making processes. These frameworks often combine technical mechanisms (like voting systems and smart contracts) with social practices and principles that guide their implementation.

The Anticapture Framework represents a significant contribution to this field, offering a systematic approach to designing systems resistant to power concentration and exploitation. It provides a structured analysis of capture risks and corresponding design patterns to create more resilient governance systems. As referenced in governance discussions throughout the knowledge base, Anticapture offers principles for balancing decentralization with effective coordination.

Similarly, Modular Politics provides a framework for understanding how governance components can be designed as interchangeable modules, allowing for flexible adaptation to different contexts and needs. This framework helps communities select and combine governance mechanisms appropriate to their specific requirements rather than imposing one-size-fits-all solutions.

### Frameworks for Social Impact

In social impact contexts, frameworks provide structured approaches to understanding and addressing complex societal challenges. They help practitioners navigate the interconnected nature of social, economic, and environmental systems while maintaining focus on equitable outcomes and community empowerment.

The various frameworks discussed in the "Governance for better futures" series offer approaches for reimagining how communities can coordinate action toward social goals. These frameworks emphasize principles like multi-scale governance, participatory decision-making, and distributed leadership to create more inclusive and effective impact initiatives.
