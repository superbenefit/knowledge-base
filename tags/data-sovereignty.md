*Data sovereignty refers to the right and capacity of individuals, communities, and governing bodies to maintain authority over their data, determining how it is collected, stored, processed, and shared while preserving autonomy and self-determination in an increasingly data-driven world.*

Data sovereignty represents a fundamental shift from extractive data models toward systems where data creators and subjects retain meaningful control throughout the data lifecycle. Unlike conventional approaches where data is often centralized and exploited with minimal regard for its origins, sovereignty-based models recognize data as an extension of individual and collective autonomy that should remain under the control of those who generate it. This principle applies across scalesâ€”from personal data and community knowledge to indigenous wisdom and national information systems.

In Web3 and decentralized contexts, data sovereignty takes on particular importance as these systems explicitly aim to create alternatives to the surveillance capitalism and data extraction that characterize many mainstream digital services. By combining technical infrastructure (like self-sovereign identity systems and decentralized storage) with governance frameworks that center community ownership, data sovereignty approaches create the conditions for more equitable, consensual relationships between data subjects, stewards, and users.

## Uses of "Data Sovereignty"

### Data Sovereignty in Indigenous and Community Contexts

For indigenous peoples and local communities, data sovereignty represents a critical extension of self-determination and cultural autonomy. This approach recognizes that knowledge and information about communities should remain under their governance, challenging historical patterns where external researchers, corporations, and governments have extracted and controlled community data without consent or benefit-sharing.

Community data sovereignty often involves governance frameworks that ensure:
- Community ownership and control of cultural knowledge and information
- Protocols for appropriate data collection, storage, and use
- Requirements for consent and benefit-sharing when external parties access community data
- Protection of sensitive cultural information according to traditional laws and customs

These approaches connect to [semiotic-bridging](tags/semiotic-bridging.md), which enables communities to "maintain sovereignty over their own information" while still participating in broader knowledge exchange networks. This balance creates systems where communities can share knowledge on their own terms without surrendering control to external platforms or authorities.

### Data Sovereignty in Personal Privacy and Identity

At the individual level, data sovereignty centers on personal control over one's digital identity, information, and online presence. This stands in contrast to conventional digital services where personal data is routinely harvested, aggregated, and monetized by platform providers with minimal transparency or user control.

Web3 approaches to personal data sovereignty include:
- Self-sovereign identity systems that give individuals control over their credentials
- Decentralized storage solutions that prevent platform lock-in
- Selective disclosure capabilities that enable sharing specific information without revealing everything
- User-controlled encryption that protects sensitive data from unauthorized access
- Personal data stores that consolidate information under individual rather than corporate control

These technologies align with [privacy](tags/privacy.md) as both "protective and generative functions," creating spaces where individuals can participate in digital life without surrendering their autonomy or exposing themselves to surveillance.

### Data Sovereignty in Web3 Infrastructure

In Web3 ecosystems, data sovereignty principles shape the design of technical infrastructure to ensure users maintain control over their information even while participating in decentralized networks. This infrastructure includes:

- Decentralized storage networks that distribute data across peer nodes rather than corporate servers
- Encryption systems that ensure only authorized parties can access sensitive information
- Self-sovereign identity protocols that separate data storage from authentication
- Verifiable credentials that enable selective disclosure of personal information
- Data unions and cooperatives that enable collective negotiation over data use

These technical implementations create what [autonomy](tags/autonomy.md) describes as "the capacity for self-governance and independent decision-making within interconnected systems," allowing participants to maintain sovereignty while still engaging in collaborative networks.

### Data Sovereignty in Governance Frameworks

Data sovereignty requires governance frameworks that formalize rights, responsibilities, and processes for data management across different scales. These frameworks translate philosophical principles into practical arrangements for determining who can access, use, and benefit from data.

Effective data sovereignty governance typically includes:
- Clear definitions of rights and responsibilities for different stakeholders
- Consent mechanisms that ensure informed participation
- Benefit-sharing arrangements that recognize data creators' contributions
- Dispute resolution processes for addressing conflicts
- Representation of data subjects in decision-making about data policies

These governance approaches connect to broader [decentralization](tags/decentralization.md) efforts that distribute "power, decision-making, and control away from a central authority to multiple individuals or entities," creating more equitable and participatory systems.
