_Authorities are entities, roles, or mechanisms that possess recognized legitimacy to make specific decisions, validate actions, or enforce rules within organizational systems, influencing how [power](power.md) and permissions flow through [governance](governance.md) structures._

Authorities represent formalized concentrations of [decision-making](decision-making.md) capacity that shape how systems operate and evolve. Unlike traditional centralized authorities that derive power from hierarchical position, authorities in [decentralized](decentralization.md) contexts are often distributed across networks, with legitimacy stemming from explicit agreements, technical protocols, or [community](community.md) consent. These distributed authorities create the necessary structure for coordinated action while avoiding the rigidity and capture risks of centralized power.

In web3 and DAO contexts, authorities take many forms—from multisignature wallets controlling treasury assets to governance councils reviewing proposals or technical validators securing network operations. The distribution, accountability, and limitations of these authorities fundamentally determine how decentralized a system truly is. Well-designed authority systems balance the need for efficient decision-making with resistance to capture and alignment with collective purpose.

## Uses of "Authorities"

### Authorities in DAO Governance

In DAO governance frameworks, authorities represent the mechanisms through which collective decisions are transformed into actions. Unlike traditional organizations where authority typically flows from hierarchical position, [DAOs](daos.md) distribute decision-making authority across different roles, functions, and processes based on clearly defined agreements.

These distributed authorities may include:

- **Treasury signers**: Entities with permission to execute financial transactions
- **Proposal reviewers**: Roles responsible for evaluating and processing governance proposals
- **Parameter setters**: Technical authorities able to modify protocol parameters
- **Dispute resolvers**: Mechanisms for addressing conflicts within the governance system

As noted in the Building DAOs as scalable networks article, effective DAO design creates appropriate authority structures across different scales. Community Governance authorities "safeguard the purpose of the network," while Operational Governance authorities enable "flexibility, [autonomy](autonomy.md) and modern incentive design to produce innovation and scale."

### Authorities in Technical Systems

In technical systems like blockchains and smart contract protocols, authorities are the entities or mechanisms with the capability to modify, validate, or execute specific functions within the system. The distribution of these technical authorities is a primary determinant of how decentralized a system truly is.

Technical authorities may include:

- **Validators**: Nodes responsible for processing transactions and maintaining [consensus](consensus.md)
- **Admin keys**: Cryptographic permissions allowing modification of protocol parameters
- **Oracle providers**: Trusted sources of external information that trigger contract execution
- **Upgradeability mechanisms**: Processes through which protocol code can be modified

The design of these technical authorities involves critical trade-offs between security, adaptability, and decentralization. As systems mature, there is often a progression from relatively centralized technical authorities toward more distributed mechanisms, though this transition requires careful governance design.

### Authorities in Cell-Based Organizations

In cell-based organizational models, authorities are distributed across autonomous teams (Cells) that maintain decision-making independence while coordinating with the broader network. Each Cell establishes its own internal authorities through transparent agreements documented in its state.

As described in the Cell working group pattern, these decentralized authorities enable "dynamic, autonomous units, avoiding bureaucratic overhead while protecting against group dysfunction." This approach creates "clear interfaces that enable trust-based [coordination](coordination.md) between groups and individuals across a broader DAO network."

The distribution of authorities in this model follows the principle that decisions should be made at the most appropriate scale and by those with the most relevant context. This creates flexibility while maintaining overall alignment with network purpose.

### Authorities in Multi-Stakeholder Governance

In multi-stakeholder governance frameworks, authorities are designed to balance the interests and influence of diverse participants. These systems explicitly acknowledge power differences between stakeholders and create mechanisms to ensure that authority is appropriately distributed.

Rather than treating all participants as equal, multi-stakeholder authorities recognize different types of expertise, investment, and impact that various parties bring to the governance process. This approach is particularly important in contexts where resource providers, operators, and beneficiaries all need meaningful voice in decision-making.

## Related Concepts

- **Permissions**: Specific rights granted to participants, often implemented and managed by authorities
- **Governance**: The overarching frameworks within which authorities operate and derive legitimacy
- **Power**: The capacity to influence outcomes, of which formal authority is one manifestation
- **Decisions**: The processes through which choices are made, often facilitated or executed by authorities
- **Delegation**: The transfer of authority from one entity to another, either temporarily or permanently
- **Consent**: A decision-making principle where authority derives from the absence of substantive objections
- **Agents**: Entities that act within systems, often holding varying degrees of authority
