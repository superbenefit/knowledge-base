This is a definition of "consensus" as it is used in Consensus Based Decision-making.

Consensus is a decision-making approach that requires all participants to actively agree with and support a proposal before it can move forward. Unlike [consent](tags/consent.md) based decision-making, which focuses on the absence of objections, consensus seeks explicit agreement and shared understanding from every stakeholder, often through discussion and modification of proposals until universal acceptance is achieved.
