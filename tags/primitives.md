Primitives are the most basic, foundational elements or operations in any system or domain, serving as the essential building blocks from which more complex structures, processes, or concepts are created.

## Uses of "Primitives"

Primitives can be seen across various domains, such as programming (e.g., data types, basic operations like addition), hardware (e.g., logic gates, transistors), and software architecture (e.g., messaging protocols, database queries). Their simplicity and generality make them highly reusable, flexible, and reliable, allowing systems to scale and evolve while maintaining clarity and modularity.

In both web3 tooling and systems design, "primitives" refer to basic, foundational components or operations that are simple, reusable, and interoperable, serving as essential building blocks for creating more complex applications, services, or systems by combining or extending them.

### Primitives in Systems Design

In systems design and #organization , #primitives refer to the most basic, foundational components or operations that cannot be simplified further but are used to build more complex systems. These building blocks provide standardized functionality or abstractions, allowing for the creation of larger, more sophisticated systems by combining or extending them.

### Primitives in web3

In #web3 tooling, #primitives refer to basic building blocks or fundamental components that developers use to create decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain-based systems. These include elements like tokens, wallets, smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, and decentralized identities, which serve as reusable, interoperable pieces of code or protocols. By combining and extending these primitives, developers can efficiently build more complex applications and services within the decentralized ecosystem.

## Primitives in Practice

Organizations can benefit from primitives by leveraging these basic building blocks to streamline processes, improve efficiency, and enhance flexibility. By breaking down complex tasks or systems into simpler, reusable components, they can standardize operations, reduce redundancy, and adapt quickly to changes.

In organization design, primitives might include basic structures like teams, roles, or decision-making protocols. For example, an organization may establish core decision-making primitives, such as a standardized approval process or a defined escalation path for resolving issues.

These elements are simple, repeatable, and can be applied across different departments or projects, allowing the organization to maintain consistency while adapting to various challenges. By utilizing these foundational building blocks, organizations can ensure that their operations are efficient, flexible, and aligned with their strategic goals.

## Concepts Related to Primitives

Many concepts are used in relation to *primitives*, and the specific qualities which define a primitive may shift from one situation to another. In the context of DAO primitives, we're referring to the social practices, software modules and coordination protocols used in the design and implementation of platforms for purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams.

Since interacting with DAO Primitives can require us to navigate information-dense realms full of abstract memes and contextually-shifting jargon, it can be helpful to familiarize ourselves with some basic concepts, and how they can relate to one another in useful ways.

Below is a practical framework for using these concepts to inform our approach to DAO Primitives. You'll see these terms come up a lot in this realm, so here's one way to make sense of them. 

### [Resources](tags/resources.md)

^6d6e1a

![[tags/resources.md#^22f819]]

In the context of organizations and systems, particularly in Web3, **resources** refer to the assets— such as funds, data, infrastructure, or human capacity —that are collectively managed, shared, and allocated through decentralized networks to achieve common goals. ^25939f

#### [Platforms](tags/platforms.md) 

![[tags/platforms.md#^2f34bd]]

In the context of organizations and systems, **platforms** are digital or organizational infrastructures that facilitate the interaction, collaboration, and exchange of resources or services, especially in decentralized environments like Web3/DAOs, enabling the creation and distribution of public goods and driving social impact initiatives. ^83b042

#### [roles](tags/roles.md) #roles

**Roles**, in the context of Web3 and systems or organizational design, are defined responsibilities or functions assigned to individuals or entities within social and technological coordination systems, guiding actions, decision-making, and interactions to ensure efficient decentralized collaboration and governance. ^096d38

### Agents #agents 

Agents are individuals or entities that act or make decisions on behalf of themselves or others, influencing outcomes through their actions or choices in various systems or environments.

In the context of organization and systems design, agents are individuals or entities responsible for initiating, controlling, or participating in actions, typically engaging in the exchange or management of resources to achieve objectives.

For practical purposes, these concepts are loosely organized in alignment with the [REA ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources%2C_Events%2C_Agents) for information systems. It's not that important, so feel free to remix them however you like.
