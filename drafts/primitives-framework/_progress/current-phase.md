# Current Phase: 4 - Complete
## Active Task: Structural Reorganization - Complete
## Last Update: 2025-11-03
## Next Action: Optional QA (Phase 6) or transformation complete
## Output Directory: drafts/primitives-framework/_outputs/

## Phase 4 Status: Complete

### Completed Steps
- [x] 4.1 Document Current Structure (structure-before.md created)
- [x] 4.2 Create New Structure (4-section directory hierarchy)
- [x] 4.3 Execute Reorganization (all 35 files copied to new structure)
- [x] 4.4 Update Navigation (all cross-references fixed)

## What Was Done

### 4.1 Document Current Structure
Created comprehensive documentation in `structure-before.md`:
- Full directory tree with file counts
- Complete file inventory (35 files)
- Structure characteristics analysis
- Reorganization impact analysis
- Preservation notes for rollback

### 4.2 Create New Structure
Created 4-section directory hierarchy:
```
1-framework-foundation/
├── organizational-elements/
└── dimensional-lenses/

2-implementation/
├── mapping/
├── graphing/
└── primitive-selection/

3-evidence/
├── case-studies/
└── articles/

4-reference/
├── quick-guides/
├── templates/
└── integrations/
```

### 4.3 Execute Reorganization
Created and executed reorganization scripts:
- `reorganize-copy.sh` - Copied all 35 files to new 4-section structure
- All files successfully moved to intended locations
- Original flat structure preserved in old directories

### 4.4 Update Navigation
Fixed all cross-references and internal links:
- `fix-links.sh` - Automated link updates for reorganized paths
- Updated all `../framework/` references to new locations
- Updated all `../reference/`, `../guides/`, `../integration/` paths
- Fixed root-level file references (cells, circle, nucleus, etc.)
- `check-links.sh` - Verified zero broken links after fixes

## Current State

**Reorganized Structure** (Complete):
- All 35 files in new 4-section hierarchy
- All cross-references updated and working
- Zero broken internal links
- Ready for editing and refinement

**New Directory Organization**:
- `1-framework-foundation/` - Core concepts and theory
- `2-implementation/` - Practical application guides
- `3-evidence/` - Case studies and real-world examples
- `4-reference/` - Quick guides, templates, integrations

## Transformation Status
- **Transformed Files**: 27/27 (100%) ✅
- **New Documents**: 8/8 (100%) ✅
- **Total Deliverables**: 35/35 (100%) ✅
- **Reorganization**: Complete (all files moved, all links fixed) ✅

## Remaining Optional Phases

**Phase 5**: Integration documentation (already complete in Phase 3)
**Phase 6**: Quality assurance (optional)

---

**Status**: Framework transformation complete. All 35 files reorganized into 4-section structure with all links fixed. Ready for editing and refinement.
