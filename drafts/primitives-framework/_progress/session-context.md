### Last File Modified
- `F:/projects/sb-knowledge-base/drafts/primitives-framework/_progress/session-context.md`

### Terminal State
- Working directory: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base`
- Git branch: main
- Phase 1 complete - 5 files transformed and ready to publish

### Pending Commands
None - Phase 1 complete, ready for Phase 2

### Context for Next Session
Phase 2 ready to begin:
- 27 files to process (22 framework + 5 from Phase 1)
- Terminology transformations mapped in improvement plan
- Need to apply: "group primitives" → "organizational elements"
- Insert Territory → Map → Graph progression language
- Add digital twin references throughout

### Files Transformed in Phase 1
1. cells.md - publish: true set
2. group-state-template.md - publish: true set
3. circle.md - publish: true set
4. nucleus.md - publish: true set
5. sense-making-facilitation-tools.md - frontmatter added, publish: true set

### Key Decisions Made
1. decision-log.md excluded (skeleton only) - documented as gap
2. All outputs isolated in `_outputs/` directory
3. Comprehensive replacement mapping tracks original → transformed files
4. Git checkpoints after each phase for rollback capability
5. Phase 1 files kept in flat structure (will reorganize in Phase 4)
