# Session Context

## Working Directory
`F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\drafts\primitives-framework\`

## Current Session: Phase 2 Complete (2025-11-03)

### Last File Modified
- `F:/projects/sb-knowledge-base/drafts/primitives-framework/_progress/session-context.md`

### Terminal State
- Working directory: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base`
- Git branch: main
- Phase 2 complete - 27 files transformed with new terminology

### Pending Commands
None - Phase 2 complete, ready for Phase 3

### Context for Next Session
Phase 3 ready to begin:
- Create 8 new documents from scratch
- Reference documents: Organizational Elements Guide, DAO Primitives Catalog
- User journey guides: Concept Learners, Practitioners, Evidence paths
- Articles: Framework Release Post
- Integration docs: SuperBenefit Services, Knowledge Garden
- Each document developed organically following existing style patterns

### Files Transformed in Phase 2
All 27 files now have updated terminology:
- 5 Phase 1 files: cells, group-state-template, circle, nucleus, sense-making-facilitation-tools
- 22 Framework files organized in _outputs/framework/:
  - 3 root files (index, group-facilitation, group-state)
  - 4 organizational elements files (daos, roles, tasks, index)
  - 6 group-phase files (all 5 phases + index)
  - 5 group-scale files (all 4 scales + index)
  - 4 implementation guides (3 governance types + index)

### Terminology Transformations Applied
- "group primitives" → "organizational elements"
- "entity primitive" → "organizational entity"
- "agreement primitive" → "organizational agreement"
- "Organizational Primitives" → "Organizational Elements"
- "(primitive)" → "(organizational element)" in titles
- "type: primitive" → "type: organizational-element"

### Conceptual Enhancements Added
- Framework/index.md now includes:
  - "Organizational Elements vs. DAO Primitives" section
  - "From Territory to Map to Graph" progression explanation
  - Clear distinction between conceptual (elements) and technical (primitives) layers
  - Digital twin language integrated into narrative

### Key Decisions Made
1. decision-log.md excluded (skeleton only) - documented as gap
2. All outputs isolated in `_outputs/` directory
3. Comprehensive replacement mapping tracks original → transformed files
4. Git checkpoints after each phase for rollback capability
5. Framework files preserve directory structure in _outputs/framework/
6. Bulk sed operations used for token efficiency
7. Digital twin language added strategically to index.md rather than all files
