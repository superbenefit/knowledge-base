# Start Here: Concept Learners Path

Welcome to the DAO Primitives Framework. This guide is designed for those who want to deeply understand the conceptual foundations of decentralized organizational design before diving into implementation.

**This path is for you if**:
- You're new to decentralized organization design
- You want to understand the theory before the practice
- You're researching organizational patterns and frameworks
- You're designing a new DAO or organizational network
- You prefer conceptual understanding before technical details

---

## Learning Journey Overview

Your path through the framework follows this progression:

1. **Foundation**: Core concepts and distinctions
2. **Elements**: The building blocks of decentralized organizations
3. **Dimensions**: Lenses for assessing organizational contexts
4. **Integration**: How concepts connect and compose

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours for initial understanding, deeper as you explore specific topics

---

## Stage 1: Foundation

### Start: Framework Overview

Begin with the big picture to understand what this framework offers and how it differs from other approaches.

**Read**: [DAO Primitives Framework Overview](../framework/index.md)

**Key Concepts**:
- Purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams
- Why decentralized organizations matter
- The primitive's approach to organizational design

**Reflection Questions**:
- What organizational challenges resonate with your context?
- How does the primitives approach differ from prescriptive frameworks you know?
- What possibilities emerge from combining flexible building blocks?

---

### Core Distinction: Elements vs. Primitives

Understanding the difference between organizational elements (conceptual) and DAO primitives (technical) is fundamental to everything that follows.

**Read**: The "Organizational Elements vs. DAO Primitives" section in [Framework Overview](../framework/index.md)

**Key Concepts**:
- Organizational elements = conceptual building blocks (DAOs, Cells, Roles, Tasks)
- DAO primitives = technical implementation tools (smart contracts, protocols)
- Digital twins: how technical tools represent organizational structures

**Reflection Questions**:
- What organizational elements exist in your current context?
- Which exist informally vs. formally documented?
- Where might technical implementation add coordination value?

---

### Core Metaphor: Territory → Map → Graph

This progression describes how organizations evolve from informal coordination to structured digital systems.

**Read**: The "From Territory to Map to Graph" section in [Framework Overview](../framework/index.md)

**Key Concepts**:
- Territory: Lived organizational reality
- Map: Documentation and qualitative description
- Graph: Structured digital twin enabling algorithmic coordination

**Reflection Questions**:
- Where is your organization in this progression?
- What aspects of your "territory" need mapping?
- When would moving to "graph" provide clear value?

---

## Stage 2: Organizational Elements

### The Four Building Blocks

Deep dive into the conceptual structures that form organizational design.

**Read**: [Organizational Elements Quick Reference](../reference/organizational-elements-guide.md)

**Study Order**:
1. **DAOs** - Network-level coordination
2. **Cells** - Small autonomous teams
3. **Roles** - Work distribution and accountability
4. **Tasks** - Discrete units of coordinated action

**For Each Element**:
- Understand its definition and purpose
- Identify how it appears in organizations you know
- Consider how it relates to other elements

---

### Deep Dive: Cells

Cells are the fundamental operational unit—understanding them deeply is crucial.

**Read**: [Cells](../cells.md)

**Key Concepts**:
- Multi-scale operation (collaboration internally, coordination externally)
- Networked autonomy
- Cell State framework (Purpose, Practice, Progress)
- Formation patterns

**Practical Exercise**:
- Map an existing team as a Cell
- Document its Purpose, Practice, Progress
- Identify its coordination relationships

---

### Deep Dive: DAOs as Networks

DAOs provide the coordination layer for networks of Cells.

**Read**: [DAOs](../framework/group-primitives/daos.md)

**Key Concepts**:
- Network-level purpose alignment
- Coordination without hierarchy
- Governance and resource management
- Enabling permissionless participation

**Practical Exercise**:
- Identify a network or ecosystem you know
- Map its cells and coordination relationships
- Consider: What DAO infrastructure would enable this network?

---

## Stage 3: Dimensional Lenses

### Understanding Context Through Dimensions

Three lenses help you assess and understand organizational contexts.

**Overview**: Read the "Framework" section in [Framework Overview](../framework/index.md)

---

### Lens 1: Group Phase

Organizations evolve through developmental stages.

**Read**: [Group Phase Index](../framework/group-phase/index.md)

**Study Each Phase**:
1. [Conversation Phase](../framework/group-phase/conversation-phase.md) - Initial exploration
2. [Formation Phase](../framework/group-phase/formation-phase.md) - Basic structure
3. [Organization Phase](../framework/group-phase/organization-phase.md) - Formal systems
4. [Coordination Phase](../framework/group-phase/coordination-phase.md) - Network integration
5. [Completion Phase](../framework/group-phase/completion-phase.md) - Conclusion and transition

**Reflection**:
- Where are your teams in their developmental journey?
- What phase-appropriate structures support current needs?
- What transitions are approaching?

---

### Lens 2: Group Scale

Different sizes require different coordination approaches.

**Read**: [Group Scale Index](../framework/group-scale/index.md)

**Study Each Scale**:
1. [Collaboration Scale](../framework/group-scale/collaboration-scale.md) - Direct relationships (< 10 people)
2. [Coordination Scale](../framework/group-scale/coordination-scale.md) - Team-to-team (10-150)
3. [Constituency Scale](../framework/group-scale/constituency-scale.md) - Community governance (150-1000+)
4. [Network Scale](../framework/group-scale/network-scale.md) - Ecosystem coordination (multi-DAO)

**Reflection**:
- At what scales does your organization operate?
- Where do coordination challenges emerge?
- How does the framework address each scale differently?

---

### Lens 3: Group State

Transparent documentation enables coordination.

**Read**: [Group State](../framework/group-state.md)

**Key Concepts**:
- Purpose: Why the group exists, its goals and relationships
- Practice: How the group operates (roles, governance, agreements)
- Progress: What the group accomplishes (activities, outputs, tracking)

**Practical Exercise**:
- Document your team's Group State
- Identify what's clear vs. unclear
- Consider who needs access to this information

---

## Stage 4: Integration & Application

### How Elements Compose

Understanding how building blocks combine.

**Synthesis Questions**:
- How do Cells nest within DAOs?
- How do Roles span across organizational boundaries?
- How do Tasks flow between elements?
- How do phases influence appropriate structures?
- How does scale affect element design?

**Exercise**:
- Design a simple DAO using organizational elements
- Choose an appropriate phase and scale
- Define its Cells, key Roles, and coordination mechanisms

---

### Facilitation Practices

Tools for working with groups through design processes.

**Read**:
- [Group Facilitation](../framework/group-facilitation.md)
- [Sense-Making Facilitation Tools](../sense-making-facilitation-tools.md)

**Key Applications**:
- Discovery and system mapping
- Co-design of organizational structures
- Navigating phase transitions
- Building shared understanding
