# Start Here: Evidence Path

Welcome to the evidence-based pathway through the DAO Primitives Framework. This guide connects you with real-world applications, case studies, and practical examples of decentralized organizational design.

**This path is for you if**:
- You learn best through concrete examples
- You want to see the framework applied in practice
- You're researching what works (and what doesn't)
- You need evidence to build organizational buy-in
- You want to understand implementation challenges and solutions

---

## Evidence Journey Overview

Your path through real-world applications:

1. **Case Studies**: Deep dives into specific implementations
2. **Patterns**: Common approaches and variations
3. **Challenges**: Lessons from failures and adaptations
4. **Evolution**: How implementations change over time

## Case Study Library

### All in for Sport (AIFS)

**Context**: Multi-stakeholder sports impact ecosystem

**Implementation Pattern**: Community governance wrapper + coordinating Cells

**Organizational Elements**:
- DAO: All in for Sport community governance
- Cells: Operational teams executing strategy
- Partnership: SuperBenefit collaboration structure

**Key Insights**:
- Community governance layer provides legitimacy and oversight
- Autonomous Cells execute operational work
- Clear interfaces between governance and operations

**Read More**: [AIFS Index](notes/rpp/rpp-experiments/all-in-for-sport/index.md)

---

### RPP Governance

**Context**: Complex multi-stakeholder partnership for regenerative public goods

**Implementation Pattern**: Multi-stakeholder coordination through networked Cells

**Organizational Elements**:
- Multiple stakeholder organizations
- Network of coordinating Cells
- Complex operations structure

**Key Insights**:
- Networked Cells enable complex coordination
- Multi-stakeholder governance requires clear agreements
- Transparent state documentation builds trust

**Read More**: [RPP Governance Case Study](artifacts/studies/projects/rpp-governance-case-study.md)

---

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern: Community Governance Wrapper

**When to Use**:
- Large community + small operational team
- Need legitimacy and accountability
- Separating governance from execution

**Structure**:
- DAO layer: Community token-holders, proposals, voting
- Cell layer: Operational teams with delegated authority
- Interface: Clear accountability mechanisms

**Examples**: AIFS

**Read**: [Community Governance Implementation Guide](../framework/dao-primitives-implementation/implementation-guide-community-governance.md)

---

### Pattern: Operational Cell Network

**When to Use**:
- Multiple specialized teams
- Distributed execution
- Coordination without hierarchy

**Structure**:
- Network of autonomous Cells
- Shared purpose and values
- Transparent state documentation

**Examples**: RPP, operational DAOs

**Read**: [Operational Governance Implementation Guide](../framework/dao-primitives-implementation/implementation-guide-operational-governance.md)

---

### Pattern: Multi-Stakeholder Coordination

**When to Use**:
- Multiple organizations partnering
- Shared resources and goals
- Balanced decision-making needed

**Structure**:
- Stakeholder organizations as governance layer
- Operational Cells executing shared work
- Clear agreements and resource flows

**Examples**: RPP, impact collaboratives

**Read**: [Multi-Stakeholder Governance Implementation Guide](../framework/dao-primitives-implementation/implementation-guide-multi-stakeholder-governance.md)

---

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Formation to Organization Transition

**Symptom**: Growing pains as informal structures become insufficient

**What Happens**:
- Confusion about decision-making authority
- Coordination overhead increases
- Bottlenecks emerge

**Solutions Applied**:
- Document Group State explicitly
- Formalize key Roles
- Establish clear Cell boundaries
- Implement lightweight coordination tools

**Evidence**: Multiple teams navigate this transition

---

### Challenge: Scale Beyond Collaboration

**Symptom**: Single team can't handle growing scope

**What Happens**:
- Team size approaches 10+ people
- Direct coordination becomes difficult
- Need to delegate but unclear how

**Solutions Applied**:
- Split into multiple Cells
- Define inter-Cell coordination mechanisms
- Establish clear domains and authorities
- Maintain shared purpose documentation

**Evidence**: Organizational scaling case studies

---

### Challenge: Balancing Autonomy and Alignment

**Symptom**: Cells drift apart or conflict emerges

**What Happens**:
- Cells pursue divergent goals
- Duplication of effort
- Resource conflicts

**Solutions Applied**:
- Strong shared purpose documentation
- Regular coordination meetings
- Transparent state sharing
- Clear resource allocation processes

**Evidence**: DAO network coordination patterns

---

## Lessons from the Field

### What Works

**Clear Purpose Documentation**:
- Cells with well-documented purpose align better
- Reduces coordination overhead
- Enables autonomous decision-making

**Appropriate Formalization**:
- Match structure to phase and scale
- Don't over-formalize too early
- Add structure incrementally as needed

**Transparent State**:
- Public Group State documentation builds trust
- Enables external coordination
- Creates accountability

**Regular Coordination Rhythms**:
- Consistent meetings and check-ins
- Asynchronous updates between meetings
- Clear escalation paths

---

### What Doesn't Work

**Premature Formalization**:
- Complex governance before clarity on purpose
- Technical tools before coordination patterns established
- Over-engineering in Conversation/Formation phases

**Insufficient Documentation**:
- Informal agreements that aren't captured
- Unclear authority and accountability
- Hidden context that blocks participation

**Tool-First Thinking**:
- Deploying DAO primitives without understanding needs
- Choosing tools before designing organizational elements
- Technology looking for problems

**Ignoring Phase and Scale**:
- Applying Coordination Phase patterns to Formation Phase teams
- Network Scale tools for Collaboration Scale groups
- One-size-fits-all approaches

## Research Questions

### Areas for Further Study

The framework continues evolving. Open research questions:

1. **Phase Transitions**: What triggers healthy transitions between phases? What interventions help?

2. **Scale Patterns**: How do successful organizations navigate scale transitions? What structures emerge?

3. **Tool Selection**: Which DAO primitives work best for which contexts? What are the tradeoffs?

4. **Network Coordination**: How do multi-DAO networks coordinate effectively? What infrastructure is needed?

5. **Measurement**: How do we assess organizational health? What metrics matter?

## Key Takeaways

Evidence shows that successful implementations:

✅ Start with clear purpose and appropriate structure for phase/scale
✅ Document organizational state transparently
✅ Implement tools incrementally as coordination needs emerge
✅ Adapt continuously based on feedback
✅ Balance autonomy with alignment through shared purpose
✅ Maintain human agency while leveraging technical coordination

**Remember**: Every context is unique. Use evidence as inspiration, not prescription.
