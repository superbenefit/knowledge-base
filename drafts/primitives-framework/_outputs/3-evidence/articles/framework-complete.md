# DAO Primitives Framework: Complete and Open

We're excited to announce the completion of the **DAO Primitives Framework**—a comprehensive approach to designing and implementing decentralized organizations as purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams.

---

## What's in the Framework

The framework provides **conceptual building blocks** and **practical guidance** for designing decentralized organizations that can scale effectively while maintaining coordination, adaptability, and collective intelligence.

### Core Components

**Organizational Elements** - The conceptual building blocks:
- **DAOs**: Purpose-aligned networks providing coordination infrastructure
- **Cells**: Small autonomous teams (3-8 people) as operational units
- **Roles**: Distributed responsibilities and accountabilities
- **Tasks**: Discrete units of coordinated work

**Dimensional Lenses** - Tools for assessing context:
- **Group Phase**: Developmental stages from Conversation to Completion
- **Group Scale**: From Collaboration (< 10) to Network (multi-DAO) coordination
- **Group State**: Documentation framework (Purpose, Practice, Progress)

**Implementation Guides** - Practical patterns:
- Community Governance
- Operational Governance
- Multi-Stakeholder Governance

**DAO Primitives Catalog** - Technical implementation tools (Smart contracts, protocols, platforms)

## Key Innovations

### 1. Elements vs. Primitives Distinction

The framework clearly separates:
- **Organizational Elements** (conceptual): The entities and agreements that exist in any organization
- **DAO Primitives** (technical): The tools that create digital twins of organizational structures

This separation enables clearer thinking about organizational design independent of technical implementation.

### 2. Territory → Map → Graph Progression

Organizations evolve through three stages:
1. **Territory**: Lived organizational reality
2. **Map**: Documentation and qualitative description
3. **Graph**: Structured digital twin enabling algorithmic coordination

This progression guides when and how to implement technical tools.

### 3. Phase and Scale Sensitivity

The framework recognizes that organizational needs differ based on:
- **Developmental phase**: Conversation requires different structures than Coordination
- **Operational scale**: Collaboration scale (< 10) needs different tools than Network scale

One-size-fits-all approaches fail. Context matters.

---

## Who Should Use This

**The framework is designed for**:

- DAO builders and governance designers
- Web3 project teams seeking better coordination
- Traditional organizations exploring decentralization
- Facilitators and consultants working with distributed teams
- Researchers studying organizational design

**Three entry points**:

1. **[Concept Learners Path](../../4-reference/quick-guides/start-concepts.md)** - Understand the theory
2. **[Practitioners Path](../../4-reference/quick-guides/start-implementation.md)** - Implement in your organization
3. **[Evidence Path](../case-studies/start-evidence.md)** - Learn from real-world applications

---

## What Makes It Different

### Flexible, Not Prescriptive

The framework provides **building blocks**, not blueprints. Organizations compose elements based on their specific context, purpose, phase, and scale.

### Grounded in Practice

Developed through real-world application with organizations like:
- All in for Sport (AIFS)
- Regenerative Public Parks (RPP)
- Multiple DAO and impact initiatives

### Conceptually Rigorous

Clear definitions and distinctions enable precise thinking about organizational design. The framework offers shared language for complex coordination challenges.

### Implementation-Focused

Practical guides, templates, and tool catalogs bridge theory to practice. Organizations can move from concepts to working systems.

## Ongoing Evolution

The framework is **complete but not finished**. It will evolve through:

**Community Contributions**:
- Case studies and implementation evidence
- Pattern identification and documentation
- Tool reviews and recommendations
- Template and resource sharing

**Research & Development**:
- Deeper investigation of phase transitions
- Cross-DAO network coordination patterns
- Measurement and assessment frameworks
- Integration with emerging DAO primitives

**Practical Application**:
- Learning from real-world implementations
- Refining based on feedback and results
- Adapting to ecosystem evolution

---

## Acknowledgments

This framework emerged from years of practice with decentralized organizations, informed by:

- Real-world implementations with impact-focused DAOs
- Research into organizational design and coordination theory
- The broader web3 and DAO ecosystem's collective learning
- Facilitation work with distributed teams
- Sociocratic and holocratic governance traditions

Special recognition to all organizations who've experimented, adapted, and contributed to this evolving body of knowledge.
