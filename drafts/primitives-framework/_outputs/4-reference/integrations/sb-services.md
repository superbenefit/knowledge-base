# SuperBenefit Services Integration

The DAO Primitives Framework is maintained and actively applied by **SuperBenefit**—a consulting practice specializing in decentralized organizational design, web3 implementation, and impact-focused governance.

This document explains how SuperBenefit uses the framework in client engagements and how organizations can access support for implementation.

## Framework in Practice

### How SuperBenefit Applies the Framework

SuperBenefit uses the DAO Primitives Framework as the conceptual foundation for all organizational design work:

**Discovery & Diagnosis**:
- Assess organizational phase and scale
- Map current territory (existing structures, relationships, coordination)
- Identify coordination challenges and opportunities

**Design & Strategy**:
- Map organizational elements to context (DAOs, Cells, Roles, Tasks)
- Select appropriate implementation patterns
- Design governance and coordination systems

**Implementation & Deployment**:
- Choose and deploy DAO primitives
- Facilitate organizational transitions
- Build capacity for ongoing adaptation

**Iteration & Evolution**:
- Monitor implementation effectiveness
- Adapt structures based on feedback
- Support phase and scale transitions

---

## Case Study Approach

### How We Work

SuperBenefit engagements follow a collaborative, context-sensitive approach:

**1. Discovery**: Understand your organizational territory
- Current structures and coordination patterns
- Challenges and opportunities
- Phase and scale assessment
- Stakeholder landscape

**2. Design**: Map elements to your context
- Co-design organizational structures
- Select implementation patterns
- Choose appropriate DAO primitives
- Create documentation frameworks

**3. Implementation**: Deploy incrementally
- Start with foundation (communication, basic treasury)
- Add coordination layer (task management, signaling)
- Formalize governance (as needed for phase)
- Support adoption and iteration

**4. Iteration**: Evolve with feedback
- Monitor effectiveness
- Adapt based on learning
- Support transitions
- Build internal capacity
