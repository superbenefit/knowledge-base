# Knowledge Garden Integration

The DAO Primitives Framework exists within a broader **knowledge garden**—an interconnected ecosystem of concepts, practices, and resources for decentralized coordination and impact-focused work.

This document maps connections between the framework and related knowledge domains.

---

## Knowledge Garden Overview

The SuperBenefit Knowledge Garden is a curated collection of interconnected knowledge about:
- Decentralized organization and governance
- Web3 tools and infrastructure
- Impact design and systems change
- Facilitation and group process
- Organizational development

The DAO Primitives Framework is one **cultivated area** within this larger garden, with clear pathways to related domains.

---

## Framework Position in the Garden

### What the Framework Provides

**Core Contribution**:
- Conceptual framework for decentralized organizational design
- Clear taxonomy (organizational elements, DAO primitives)
- Phase and scale sensitivity
- Implementation patterns and practices

**Boundaries**:
- Focused on organizational structure and coordination
- Does not cover: tokenomics, smart contract development, legal structures (in depth)
- Complements rather than replaces specialized knowledge domains

## Conceptual Connections

### Key Bridges Between Domains

**Sociocracy ↔ DAO Primitives**:
- Circles = Cells (with specific governance structure)
- Domains = Cell boundaries and authority
- Double-linking = Cross-Cell Role coordination
- Read: [Circle Pattern](../circle.md)

**Holocracy ↔ DAO Primitives**:
- Circles map to Cells
- Roles are explicit organizational agreements
- Tactical and governance meetings = coordination rhythms

**Platform Cooperativism ↔ DAO Primitives**:
- Cooperative ownership = token-based governance
- Democratic control = DAO governance layer
- Shared value = treasury and token distribution

**Commons Governance ↔ DAO Primitives**:
- CPR (Common Pool Resource) = DAO treasury
- Nested institutions = layered Cells and DAOs
- Monitoring and sanctions = on-chain transparency
