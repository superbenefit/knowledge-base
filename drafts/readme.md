This directory is your private space for unpolished ideas and experimental thinking. It's excluded from version control to ensure your drafts remain private.

# Personal Drafts

Think of the `drafts` directory as your personal workbench. It's where you can freely jot down initial thoughts without worrying about structure, explore new concepts without judgment, and store anything you don't want to immediately share publicly. It's a space for capturing those fleeting ideas before they disappear!

## Getting Started

To use the `drafts` directory effectively:

1.  Simply add your ideas as Markdown files (`.md`). There's no need to overthink it â€“ just capture your thoughts as they come.
2.  If you're looking for a bit of structure, feel free to use the templates from `/tools/templates/`, but don't feel constrained by them. The goal is to let your ideas flow naturally.
3.  Remember, these files are *only* stored on your local machine and are *not* backed up to the repository. This ensures your privacy and allows you to experiment freely.
4.  When you're ready to collaborate, move your file to the appropriate project folder in the `/notes/` directory. This signals that you're ready to share your ideas with the team.

## Important Considerations

Because this directory is `.gitignore`d, it's essential to understand the following:

*   **Privacy:** Your drafts are *only* stored on your local machine.
*   **Backup:** Since the `drafts` directory is not version controlled, it's crucial to have your own backup strategy for any valuable drafts you want to preserve.
*   **Collaboration:** To share your work and collaborate with others, you *must* move your files to the `/notes/` directory.
