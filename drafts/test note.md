### Steps in the decider process

**1. Proposal Initiation** 
The team member presents a clear, actionable proposal to the group and initiates the voting sequence by stating "1-2-3."

**2. Simultaneous Response** 
Team members indicate their position using one of three gestures:
- Consent (thumbs up)
- Object (thumbs down)
- Support it/abstain (horizontal hand)

**3. Critical Objection Check** 
Team members with absolute objections declare "I am an absolute no." Any critical objection immediately pauses the proposal for reconsideration.

**4. Assessment** 
The proposing team member evaluates responses, considering:

- The ratio of Support to total responses
- The effort required to find resolution versus expected value of the decision
- Whether to proceed to resolution or withdraw the proposal

**5. Resolution Phase** 
If justified, the proposing team member can engage with no voters to see if the proposal can be modified to get them to a yes.

**6. Completion** 
The proposal passes when either:
- All Agents indicate Consent or Support
- All objections have been resolved through modification
The agreed proposal becomes a binding agreement for all participating team members.

**Key Principles**
- Rapid iteration
- Collective intelligence
- Constructive objection
- Efficient resolution
- Shared commitment
