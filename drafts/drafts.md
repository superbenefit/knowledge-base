# Drafts Directory: Your Local Idea Lab

Welcome to the `drafts` directory! This is your personal space for exploring new ideas, conducting initial research, and developing rough drafts of content for the SuperBenefit Knowledge Base.

Think of this as your "idea incubator," where you can freely experiment without worrying about the polish or structure required for more public-facing content.

## What Belongs Here?

*   **Rough Notes:** Unstructured thoughts, ideas, and observations.
*   **Research Snippets:** Excerpts from articles, papers, or other sources.
*   **Brainstorming Sessions:** Mind maps, outlines, and other brainstorming materials.
*   **Initial Drafts:** Early versions of notes or artifacts that are not yet ready for collaboration.
*   **Personal Reflections:** Private thoughts and reflections on relevant topics.

## How to Use This Directory

1.  **Create New Notes:** Start a new note for each idea or topic you want to explore.
2.  **Use Templates (Optional):** Use the templates in [tools/templates/](tools/templates/) as a starting point, but don't feel constrained by them.
3.  **Experiment Freely:** Don't worry about formatting, grammar, or structure at this stage. The goal is to capture your thoughts and ideas as quickly and easily as possible.
4.  **Connect Ideas (Optional):** Use internal links to connect related notes, but don't feel obligated to create a complex web of knowledge.
5.  **Refine and Develop:** As your ideas develop, consider moving them to the `notes` directory for collaboration and further refinement.

### Your Local Sandbox

**Important:** To protect your privacy and ensure a safe space for exploration, the `drafts` directory is excluded from version control. This means that the contents of this directory are stored *only on your local computer* and are not synced to the GitHub repository. Feel free to jot down anything here without concern for it being shared publicly.

## Moving to the Next Stage

When your content is ready for collaboration and further development, consider moving it to the `notes` directory. This signals that you're ready to share your ideas with others and work together to refine them.

Remember, the `drafts` directory is a safe space for experimentation and exploration. Don't be afraid to make mistakes or try new things. The goal is to capture your thoughts and ideas in a way that is helpful to you.
