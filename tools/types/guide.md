The Guide type provides instructional content that teaches specific skills, concepts, or tools relevant to the DAO ecosystem. Guides focus on education and capability building, helping community members develop competencies needed for effective participation.

Extending Story, guides accommodate tutorials, explanations, reference materials, and exercises. They fill the educational gap between conceptual patterns and practical playbooks by teaching the underlying skills and knowledge.

Located in `data/stories/guides/`, guides provide a structured approach to knowledge transfer distinct from the implementation focus of Playbooks or the conceptual focus of Patterns.
