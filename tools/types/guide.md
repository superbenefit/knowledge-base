The Guide type provides instructional content that teaches specific skills, concepts, or tools relevant to the DAO ecosystem. Guides focus on education and capability building, helping community members develop competencies needed for effective participation.

Located in `/artifacts/guides/` and automatically associated with content tagged "guides," this type accommodates tutorials, explanations, reference materials, and exercises. Guides fill the educational gap between conceptual patterns and practical playbooks by teaching the underlying skills and knowledge needed to implement DAO solutions effectively.

Currently reserved for future use in the SuperBenefit knowledge base, the Guide type is positioned to support educational initiatives as the community's learning needs evolve. It provides a structured approach to knowledge transfer distinct from the implementation focus of Playbooks or the conceptual focus of Patterns.
