## Guide Type

Focused implementation documents that provide targeted instruction for specific processes or tools, more concise than playbooks but more practical than patterns.

Guides occupy a middle ground in our instructional contentâ€”they're more detailed than pattern descriptions but less comprehensive than full playbooks. A guide might explain how to use a specific tool, implement a particular process, or navigate a defined procedure. The book icon signals their instructional nature.

Living in `/artifacts/guides/` with automatic tagging through the 'guides' tag, these documents serve practitioners who need clear direction on specific topics without the full context and complexity of a playbook. They're particularly useful for documenting tool usage, standard procedures, or focused implementations.

**Key distinction**: Guides provide focused, practical instruction on specific topics, while playbooks offer comprehensive implementation strategies and patterns describe conceptual solutions. A guide shows "how to use Snapshot for voting"; a playbook covers "implementing comprehensive governance systems."
