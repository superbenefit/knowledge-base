The Reference type extends Note to provide a parent classification for structural and navigational content within the knowledge base. It serves as an organizational type that groups together various forms of reference materials that support content discovery and orientation.

Reference content differs from regular notes in that it primarily serves to organize, categorize, and connect other content rather than containing substantive information itself. Reference types focus on creating pathways, relationships, and context rather than presenting original ideas or research.

As a parent type, Reference is rarely used directly but provides the foundation for specialized reference types like Index, Link, and Tag. This inheritance structure ensures consistent behavior across all organizational content while allowing each subtype to add its specific functionality.

**Template**: Typically uses subtypes (index, link, tag)
