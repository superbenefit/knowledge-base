The Reference type extends File to provide a parent classification for structural and navigational content within the knowledge base. It serves as an organizational type that groups together various forms of reference materials that support content discovery and orientation.

Reference content differs from regular files in that it primarily serves to organize, categorize, and connect other content rather than containing substantive information itself. Reference types focus on creating pathways, relationships, and context.

As a parent type, Reference is rarely used directly but provides the foundation for specialized reference types like Index, Link, and Tag.

**Template**: Typically uses subtypes (index, link, tag)
