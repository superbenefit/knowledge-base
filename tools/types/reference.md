## Reference Type

Parent type for specialized reference materials including indices, links, and tags, providing a common foundation for content that supports navigation and contextualization rather than primary knowledge creation.

Reference materials serve supporting roles in our knowledge ecosystemâ€”they help people find, understand, and connect information rather than presenting new knowledge directly. By extending the note type, reference materials inherit basic metadata while serving fundamentally different purposes than standard notes or artifacts.

This type primarily exists as a parent for more specific reference types (index, link, tag) and is rarely used directly. It establishes the conceptual category of "supporting materials" that enhance the usability and interconnectedness of our primary content.

**Key distinction**: Reference types support navigation and understanding of other content, while notes and artifacts contain primary knowledge. This is an intermediate parent type primarily used for inheritance.

**Template**: Typically not used directly - use specific reference subtypes instead
