The Study type documents real-world implementations and case studies that provide empirical evidence for patterns and approaches. Studies capture the messy reality of organizational experiments, including both successes and failures, to build an evidence base for DAO design.

Tagged with "studies" for automatic association, these documents provide the crucial feedback loop from practice to theory. Studies validate or challenge patterns, surface unexpected emergent behaviors, and document the context-specific adaptations required for successful implementation. They transform isolated experiments into collective learning.
