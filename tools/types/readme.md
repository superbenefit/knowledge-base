## Note Type

The foundation type for all content in the SuperBenefit Knowledge Base, establishing core metadata fields that support the knowledge development cycle from initial capture through collaborative refinement.

Notes represent dynamic, evolving contentâ€”ideas in motion rather than fixed conclusions. They live primarily in `/notes/` for collaborative work and `/drafts/` for personal exploration, providing the flexibility needed for knowledge to mature naturally through community interaction.

As the base type with no parent, Note defines the essential fields inherited by most other types: title, description, date, and the critical publish field that controls visibility in the Knowledge Garden. This minimal but complete structure ensures consistency while avoiding unnecessary complexity.

**Key distinction**: Notes are works-in-progress meant for internal development, while artifacts represent validated, publication-ready content. The transition from note to artifact marks a significant milestone in our [knowledge development process](/tools/types/artifact.md).
