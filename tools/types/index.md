The Index type provides directory-level navigation and orientation pages throughout the knowledge base. Index files serve as landing pages that help users understand the structure, purpose, and contents of each section.

Extending Reference rather than Note, Index pages reflect their role in organizing rather than containing information. They typically include section overviews, content maps, navigation guides, and curated links to key resources within their directory.

Every major directory should have an index.md file that explains its purpose, describes its contents, and guides users to relevant resources. These pages are essential for maintaining navigability as the knowledge base grows, providing consistent entry points for exploration.
