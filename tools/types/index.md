## Index Type

Directory navigation pages that provide orientation, context, and wayfinding for each section of the knowledge base, transforming folder structures into meaningful organizational narratives.

Index pages do more than list contentsâ€”they explain the purpose of each directory, how its contents relate to each other, and guide visitors toward the resources they need. With the distinctive folder-search icon, index pages are immediately recognizable as structural elements rather than content pieces.

Extending the reference type and typically placed at directory roots, index pages serve as the connective tissue of our information architecture. They help contributors understand where to place new content and help readers navigate our expanding knowledge ecosystem with purpose and clarity.

**Key distinction**: Index pages organize and explain directory structure, while other types contain actual content. An index describes what's in `/artifacts/patterns/` and how to use it; patterns themselves contain the reusable solutions.

**Template**: [/tools/templates/index.md](/tools/templates/index.md)
