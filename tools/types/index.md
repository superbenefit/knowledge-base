The Index type provides structure and navigation for directories within the knowledge base. It serves as the foundation for folder index pages that orient users to the contents and organization of specific sections of the knowledge base.

Index files act as landing pages for directories, offering context, explanation, and navigation guidance. They help users understand the purpose of each directory, how its contents are organized, and how to find specific information within it.

Unlike most other types, Index does not extend from the base Note type, as it serves a unique structural role. With its folder-search icon, this type is visually distinct, helping contributors identify directory-level documentation throughout the knowledge base.
