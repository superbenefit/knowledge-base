The Link type documents and contextualizes external resources relevant to the SuperBenefit knowledge base. Links go beyond simple bookmarking by adding analysis, commentary, and connections to internal knowledge.

Located in `/library/` to create a curated resource collection, Links extend the Reference type. Each link entry includes not just the URL and basic metadata, but also summaries, relevance explanations, and relationships to patterns, studies, or other content types.

This type enables the curation of a living library that bridges internal knowledge development with the broader ecosystem of ideas. Links maintain awareness of external developments, credit sources of inspiration, and provide pathways for deeper exploration beyond the knowledge base boundaries.
