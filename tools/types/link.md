The Link type documents external resources and references that inform the SuperBenefit knowledge base. Extending the Note type, Link provides structured metadata for curating and contextualizing external content such as articles, papers, videos, and other resources.

Links serve as bridges between the internal knowledge base and the broader ecosystem of ideas, research, and projects. Each link includes not just the reference itself, but also commentary, analysis, and connections to related concepts within the knowledge base.

Primarily used in the `/library/` directory, this type enables the SuperBenefit community to maintain a curated collection of valuable external resources while adding contextual information that enhances their relevance to our specific focus areas.
