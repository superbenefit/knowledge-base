## Link Type

Curated external resources enhanced with contextual analysis and connections to our internal knowledge ecosystem, transforming simple references into valuable knowledge bridges.

Links go beyond bookmarkingâ€”each entry includes commentary that explains why the resource matters, what insights it offers, and how it connects to patterns, concepts, and discussions within our knowledge base. This added context transforms a collection of URLs into a living library where external knowledge enriches our internal understanding.

Housed in the `/library/` directory and extending the reference type, links serve as windows to the broader ecosystem of ideas about DAOs, governance, and decentralized organization. The curation process itself generates value by filtering signal from noise and highlighting connections that might not be immediately apparent.

**Key distinction**: Links are external resources with our analysis and context, not internal content we've created. They extend the reference type (not note), emphasizing their role as connective tissue between our knowledge and the wider world.
