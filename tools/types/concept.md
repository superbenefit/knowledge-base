The Concept type defines entries in the SuperBenefit lexicon — the shared vocabulary that enables precise communication about complex organizational concepts. Concepts establish common definitions, document etymology, and map relationships between terms.

Located in `data/concepts/` and automatically associated through tag mapping, each concept entry includes definitions, context, usage examples, and aliases.

This creates a controlled vocabulary that reduces ambiguity and reveals conceptual relationships. The lexicon forms the linguistic foundation for all other content types.
