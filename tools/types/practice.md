The Practice type documents ways of doing — repeatable methodologies and approaches that embody one or more patterns. Practices capture the tacit knowledge of how patterns are applied in real contexts.

Extending Resource, Practices inherit the url field for external references. Content tagged with "practices" automatically associates with this type.

Located in `data/resources/practices/`, practices bridge the gap between abstract patterns and concrete implementation, providing the procedural knowledge needed for effective action.
