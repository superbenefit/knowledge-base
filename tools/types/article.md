The Article type represents formal publications, essays, or in-depth analyses on topics related to DAOs, Web3 governance, and decentralized organizations. Extending the Artifact type, Article provides structure for longer-form content that presents coherent arguments, research findings, or thought leadership.

Articles may be originally published on external platforms (like Mirror.xyz) and referenced with a URL, or they may be native publications within the knowledge base. The 'author' field can include multiple contributors, acknowledging collaborative authorship.

Tagged with 'articles' and stored in the `/artifacts/articles/` directory, this type serves as a vehicle for distributing more polished, comprehensive perspectives that contribute to the broader discourse on decentralization, governance, and social impact.
