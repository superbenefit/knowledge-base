The Article type represents formal publications, essays, and in-depth analyses on topics relevant to decentralized organizations. Articles provide space for thought leadership, theoretical exploration, and comprehensive treatment of complex topics.

Extending Artifact, Articles accommodate longer-form content that develops arguments, presents research, or offers perspectives. Content may originate on external platforms like Mirror.xyz or be native to the knowledge base. The `/artifacts/articles/` directory houses these more formal writings.

Articles differ from other artifact types by emphasizing narrative and argumentation over structured frameworks (patterns) or procedures (playbooks). They contribute to discourse, challenge assumptions, and explore implications, serving as a bridge between the SuperBenefit knowledge base and broader Web3 conversations.
