The Primitive type documents foundational building blocks for decentralized organization design. Primitives are the atomic units from which more complex patterns and systems are composed.

Extending Resource, Primitives inherit the url field for external references. Content tagged with "primitives" automatically associates with this type.

Located in `data/resources/primitives/`, primitives provide the conceptual vocabulary for designing DAOs and decentralized systems.
