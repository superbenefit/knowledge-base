## Artifact Type

Published, validated content that represents the collective understanding and consensus of the SuperBenefit community on specific topics, patterns, or concepts.

Artifacts mark the maturation of knowledge from exploratory notes into refined, reliable resources. The transition from note to artifact signifies that content has undergone collaborative review, achieved clarity, and provides genuine value to the broader community. This evolution is documented in both this type definition and the [note type](/tools/types/note.md).

Living in the `/artifacts/` directory, these pieces serve as the primary knowledge products of our collaborative efforts. By extending the note type, artifacts inherit all base fields while representing a fundamentally different stage in our knowledge development cycleâ€”from exploration to establishment.

**Key distinction**: Unlike notes which capture ideas in development, artifacts represent completed thinking ready for implementation and reuse. This type serves as the parent for specialized formats like patterns, playbooks, and studies.
