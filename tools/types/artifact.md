The Artifact type represents polished, validated content that has completed the knowledge development cycle. Artifacts are the most refined form of content in the knowledge base, having evolved from drafts and working notes into finished products ready for broader consumption.

Extending the Note type, Artifact inherits core metadata fields while being specifically associated with the `/artifacts/` directory. Artifacts represent the collective understanding of the SuperBenefit community on specific topics, patterns, or concepts.

This type serves as a parent type for more specialized artifacts such as patterns, playbooks, and studies, providing a consistent foundation for all published content while allowing specialized extensions for different content forms.
