## Protocol Type

Formal process documentation that defines standardized procedures, rules, or interaction patterns for specific organizational functions or inter-organizational coordination.

Protocols establish clear, repeatable processes that ensure consistency and interoperability. Unlike patterns which describe general solutions, or playbooks which guide implementation, protocols specify exact procedures that should be followed to achieve predictable outcomes. They're particularly important for governance processes, decision-making procedures, and cross-DAO interactions.

With automatic tagging through `mapWithTag` for content tagged 'protocols', this type supports the documentation of formal procedures that may be adopted across multiple organizations. Protocols often reference relevant patterns while specifying precise implementation requirements.

**Key distinction**: Protocols define exact procedures to be followed, while playbooks provide flexible implementation guidance and patterns describe conceptual approaches. A protocol specifies "the seven steps of our consent process"; a playbook explains "how to adapt consent processes to your context."
