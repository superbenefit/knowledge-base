The Protocol type documents formal procedures, standards, and specifications used within decentralized organizations. Protocols represent agreed-upon rules and processes that ensure consistent operation and coordination.

As a specialized artifact type, Protocols focus on standardized, repeatable processes rather than adaptive implementation guidance. Content tagged with "protocols" automatically associates with this type. They differ from Playbooks by emphasizing rigid procedures over flexible frameworks, providing the operational backbone for DAO functionality.

Currently reserved for future use, the Protocol type will accommodate governance procedures, technical standards, communication protocols, and other formal specifications as the SuperBenefit knowledge base expands to include more operational documentation.
