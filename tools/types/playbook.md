## Playbook Type

Comprehensive, actionable guides that combine multiple patterns and practices into step-by-step implementation instructions for specific organizational processes or transformations.

Playbooks bridge the gap between conceptual understanding and practical application. Where patterns provide the "what" and "why," playbooks deliver the "how"â€”offering detailed procedures, checklists, timelines, and decision criteria that practitioners can follow directly. The higher record limit (50) accommodates the detailed nature of implementation guidance.

Located in `/artifacts/playbooks/` and auto-tagged through `mapWithTag`, playbooks serve as the practical manuals of our knowledge base. They often reference multiple patterns, weaving them together into cohesive implementation strategies that have been tested in real-world contexts.

**Key distinction**: Playbooks focus on practical, sequential implementation steps, while patterns describe reusable conceptual solutions. A playbook tells you exactly how to run a consent process meeting; a pattern explains why consent-based decision making works.
