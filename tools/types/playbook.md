The Playbook type provides comprehensive, actionable guidance for implementing specific processes, frameworks, or methodologies within decentralized organizations. Extending the Artifact type, Playbooks combine multiple patterns and primitives into cohesive, practical implementation guides.

Playbooks move beyond theoretical explanations to offer step-by-step instructions, practical considerations, and real-world examples. They address specific organizational challenges with proven approaches, helping practitioners navigate complex implementation processes.

Stored in the `/artifacts/playbooks/` directory and tagged with 'playbooks', this type bridges theory and practice by providing accessible, structured guidance that can be directly applied in organizational contexts.
