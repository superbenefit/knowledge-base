## Pattern Type

Reusable solutions to recurring challenges in decentralized organization design and governance, providing conceptual frameworks that can be adapted across different contexts and implementations.

Patterns capture proven approaches that have emerged from practical experience, abstracting the essential elements that make solutions work while remaining flexible enough for contextual adaptation. Unlike prescriptive guides, patterns focus on the underlying principles and mechanismsâ€”the "what" and "why" rather than the detailed "how."

Stored in `/artifacts/patterns/` and automatically associated with content tagged 'patterns' through `mapWithTag`, this type enables building a pattern language for DAOs. Each pattern documents problem context, solution approach, implementation considerations, and relationships to other patterns.

**Key distinction**: Patterns provide conceptual frameworks and reusable solutions, while playbooks offer step-by-step implementation instructions. A pattern might describe "consent-based decision making" as a concept; a playbook would detail "how to implement consent voting in your DAO."
