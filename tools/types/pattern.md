The Pattern type documents reusable solutions to recurring challenges in decentralized organization design and governance. Patterns capture proven approaches that can be adapted across different contexts, building a library of organizational building blocks for the DAO ecosystem.

As validated conceptual frameworks within the artifact family, Patterns balance theoretical understanding with practical applicability. Each pattern includes problem context, solution mechanisms, implementation considerations, and relationships to other patterns. Content tagged with "patterns" automatically associates with this type.

Located in `/artifacts/patterns/`, these documents form the core of SuperBenefit's contribution to DAO knowledge - identifying and codifying successful organizational designs. Patterns differ from Playbooks by focusing on conceptual solutions rather than step-by-step implementation, providing the "why" and "what" that complements the "how."
