The Pattern type documents reusable solutions to common challenges in decentralized organization (DAO) design and governance. Extending the Artifact type, Pattern represents well-established approaches that can be applied across different contexts and implementations.

Patterns capture both the theoretical framework and practical implementation details of organizational structures, processes, or mechanisms. Each pattern includes problem/solution context, mechanism explanation, implementation guidance, and relationships to other patterns and primitives.

Stored in the `/artifacts/patterns/` directory and tagged with 'patterns', this type enables the SuperBenefit community to build a shared library of proven approaches, creating a common language and framework for discussing organizational design.
