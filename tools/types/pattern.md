The Pattern type documents reusable solutions to recurring challenges in decentralized organization design and governance. Patterns capture proven approaches that can be adapted across different contexts, building a library of organizational building blocks for the DAO ecosystem.

Extending Resource, Patterns inherit the url field for external references. Content tagged with "patterns" automatically associates with this type.

Located in `data/resources/patterns/`, these documents form the core of SuperBenefit's contribution to DAO knowledge. Patterns differ from Playbooks by focusing on conceptual solutions rather than step-by-step implementation.
