The Data type is the parent for entity records — people, groups, projects, places, and gatherings that represent actors and entities in the world.

Data types extend File with minimal additional structure, as each sub-type defines its own domain-specific fields.

**Template**: Uses subtypes (person, group, project, place, gathering)
