The Tag type defines entries in the SuperBenefit lexicon - our shared vocabulary of concepts, terms, and ideas. Extending the Note type, Tag provides structured documentation of terminology used throughout the knowledge base, creating consistency and clarity in communication.

Each Tag includes a concise definition, contextual explanations, related concepts, and usage examples. The 'aliases' field captures alternative names or hashtag formats, ensuring terms can be found regardless of how they're referenced.

Mapped with related tags and stored in the `/tags/` directory, this type forms the foundation of our shared language, enabling precise communication about complex concepts while revealing relationships between ideas that might otherwise remain hidden.
