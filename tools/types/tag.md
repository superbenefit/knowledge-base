## Tag Type

Lexicon entries that define our shared vocabulary, ensuring consistent understanding of key concepts, terms, and ideas across the SuperBenefit community.

Tags are more than labelsâ€”they're carefully crafted definitions that create semantic bridges between documents. Each tag entry includes concise definitions, contextual explanations, usage examples, and related concepts. Through `mapWithTag: true`, any content tagged with a term automatically associates with its lexicon definition, creating bidirectional discovery paths.

Living in the `/tags/` directory and extending the reference type, tags form the semantic foundation of our knowledge graph. They enable precise communication about complex concepts while revealing the conceptual relationships that structure our collective understanding. Aliases and hashtag formats ensure terms can be found regardless of variation.

**Key distinction**: Tags define terminology and create semantic relationships, while other content types use these definitions. A tag explains what "quadratic voting" means; a pattern shows how to implement it.
