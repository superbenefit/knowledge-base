The Tag type defines entries in the SuperBenefit lexicon - the shared vocabulary that enables precise communication about complex organizational concepts. Tags establish common definitions, document etymology, and map relationships between terms.

Located in `/tags/` and automatically associated through tag mapping, this type processes lexicon entries that extend the Reference type. This emphasizes their role in organizing and relating concepts rather than containing substantive content themselves.

Each tag entry includes definitions, context, usage examples, aliases, and related terms. This creates a controlled vocabulary that reduces ambiguity and reveals conceptual relationships. The lexicon forms the linguistic foundation for all other content types, ensuring consistent terminology across the knowledge base.
