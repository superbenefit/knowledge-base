# Tools & Resources

This directory contains the building blocks that help maintain consistency and structure in our knowledge garden. Whether you're creating new content, organizing information, or setting up metadata, these tools make it easier to contribute effectively to our shared knowledge base.

## Overview

These tools work together to support our knowledge garden's growth and organization:

- **Templates** help you create new content quickly and consistently
- **Types** ensure that our documents have the right structure and metadata
- **Prompts** provide frameworks for AI-assisted content creation

Together, they form an ecosystem that supports the natural flow of knowledge from initial ideas to polished artifacts.

### Directory Structure

The tools directory is organized into three main areas, each serving a distinct purpose in our workflow:

```
tools/
├── templates/     # Document templates for content creation
├── types/         # Metadata type definitions (fileClasses)
└── prompts/       # AI prompt templates for content generation
```

## Core Components

### Templates (`templates/`)

Templates are like smart starting points for new documents. Instead of starting from scratch each time, templates provide you with the right structure and metadata fields based on what kind of content you're creating. Think of them as pre-formatted documents that help maintain consistency across our knowledge base.

Available templates include:

- `Note Template.md` - For general notes
- `Link Template.md` - For external resource documentation
- `Pattern Template.md` - For documenting reusable solutions
- `Tag Page Template.md` - For term definitions in our lexicon
- `Study Template.md` - For case studies
- `Playbook Template.md` - For comprehensive process documentation

See the Templates Directory for complete documentation.

### Types (`types/`)

Types are the rules and structure that help organize our content. They define what information (metadata) should be included with different kinds of documents, making it easier to organize, find, and connect related content.

Our type system includes:

- `note.md` - Basic note template
- `link.md` - External reference documentation
- `pattern.md` - Reusable solution documentation
- `tag.md` - Term definition
- `study.md` - Case study documentation
- And several others for specialized content

See the Types Directory for detailed information.

## Workflow Tools

### Prompts (`prompts/`)

Prompts are structured frameworks for generating content with AI assistance. They help maintain consistency while accelerating content creation. Our prompt library includes:

- `Resource Evaluation Framework` - For assessing external resources for inclusion
- `Web3 Library Entry Creation` - For creating standardized library entries

Each prompt follows a consistent format and includes specific instructions for generating content that aligns with our knowledge base standards.

## Integration with Obsidian

These tools are designed to work with Obsidian plugins:

- **Metadata Menu**: Manages types and frontmatter fields
- **Templater**: Enhances template capabilities
- **Dataview**: Queries and displays structured information

For detailed plugin configuration, see the plugin documentation in your Obsidian help resources.
