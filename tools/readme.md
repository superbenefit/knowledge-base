# Tools Directory

This directory contains the building blocks that help maintain consistency and structure in our knowledge garden. Whether you're creating new content, organizing information, or setting up metadata, these tools make it easier to contribute effectively to our shared knowledge base.

## Directory Structure

The tools directory is organized into two main areas, each serving a distinct purpose in our workflow:

```
tools/
├── templates/     # Document templates for content creation
└── types/         # Metadata type definitions (fileClasses)
```

## Overview

These tools work together to support our knowledge garden's growth and organization. Templates help you create new content quickly and consistently, while types ensure that our documents have the right structure and metadata for effective organization and discovery.

### Templates (`/templates`)

Templates are like smart starting points for new documents. Instead of starting from scratch each time, templates provide you with the right structure and metadata fields based on what kind of content you're creating. Think of them as pre-formatted documents that help maintain consistency across our knowledge base.

Key features:
- Ready-to-use document structures
- Pre-filled metadata fields
- Consistent formatting
- Integration with our type system
- Usage documentation

### Types (`/types`)

Types are the rules and structure that help organize our content. They define what information (metadata) should be included with different kinds of documents, making it easier to organize, find, and connect related content. If templates are the "what," types are the "how" of our document structure.

Key features:
- Metadata field definitions
- Field validation rules
- Inheritance capabilities
- Template integration
- Documentation standards

## Using These Tools

Creating and organizing content in our knowledge garden should be straightforward. Here's how these tools can help you contribute effectively.

## Best Practices

When working with these tools, keeping a few key principles in mind will help you and others maintain a well-organized knowledge garden.

1. Start Simple
   - Use existing templates when possible
   - Follow the basic structure
   - Ask for help when needed

2. Stay Consistent
   - Use templates for new documents
   - Fill in all required fields
   - Follow naming conventions
