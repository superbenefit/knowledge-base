# Tools & Plugins

This directory contains the building blocks that help maintain consistency and structure in our knowledge garden. Whether you're creating new content, organizing information, or setting up metadata, these tools make it easier to contribute effectively to our shared knowledge base.

## Overview

These tools work together to support our knowledge garden's growth and organization. Templates help you create new content quickly and consistently, while types ensure that our documents have the right structure and metadata for effective organization and discovery.

### Directory Structure

The tools directory is organized into two main areas, each serving a distinct purpose in our workflow:

```
tools/
├── templates/     # Document templates for content creation
└── types/         # Metadata type definitions (fileClasses)
```

## Metadata & Formatting Tools


### Templates (`templates/`)

[Templates](/tools/templates/readme.md) are like smart starting points for new documents. Instead of starting from scratch each time, templates provide you with the right structure and metadata fields based on what kind of content you're creating. Think of them as pre-formatted documents that help maintain consistency across our knowledge base.

- [Template Directory](/tools/templates/readme.md)

### Types (`types/`)

[Types](/tools/types/readme.md) are the rules and structure that help organize our content. They define what information (metadata) should be included with different kinds of documents, making it easier to organize, find, and connect related content. If templates are the "what," types are the "how" of our document structure.

- [Types Directory](/tools/types/readme.md)

Creating and organizing content in our knowledge garden should be straightforward. Here's how these tools can help you contribute effectively.
