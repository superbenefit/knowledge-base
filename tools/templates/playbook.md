%% This template creates comprehensive, actionable guidance for implementing specific processes or methodologies within social purpose projects and organizations. Use it to combine multiple patterns and protocols into cohesive implementation guides with practical, step-by-step instructions, focusing on decentralized solutions. The structured format helps you create playbooks that bridge theory and practice with concrete examples and advice.

## Understanding Patterns in Context

%% You might want to introduce how patterns help address the challenges in your specific domain %%

### Core Pattern Set

%% An overview of which patterns you've chosen for this playbook and why they work well together %%

%% You could add a dataview query here to automatically list related patterns %%

%% Some authors find it helpful to include guidance on how readers might contribute to improving the pattern library %%

#### Pattern Group A: `[Functional Area]`

%% 
You might explore:
- What context and challenges this group addresses
- Key considerations for applying these patterns in this context 
%%

%% Consider transcluding or linking to specific patterns here %%

%% 
You could add:
- Additional context specific to this playbook
- Local considerations and adaptations
- How these patterns connect with others in the set
%%

### Pattern Group B: `[Functional Area]`

%% You can repeat this structure for other pattern groups as needed %%

## Pattern Interactions

%% This section often explores important relationships:
- How these patterns complement each other
- Common combinations and their effects
- Dependencies or prerequisites to be aware of
- Potential conflicts worth watching for
- Synergistic effects you might leverage %%
