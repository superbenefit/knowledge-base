%% LEAD: In 2-3 sentences, name the pattern and its core insight. What recurring challenge does it address? What makes this solution reusable across contexts? Example: "The *Nucleus Pattern* addresses the challenge of bootstrapping decentralized organizations by starting with a small, high-trust core team that establishes culture and processes before expanding." %%

## The Pattern

### Context

%% Describe the environments where this pattern applies. What types of organizations, what stages of development, what coordination challenges? Be specific enough that readers can recognize whether their situation fits. %%

### Problem

%% Articulate the specific challenge this pattern addresses. What goes wrong without it? What tensions or trade-offs does it navigate? Frame the problem clearly so the solution makes sense. %%

### Solution

%% Explain the conceptual approach—the key principles, mechanisms, and components. This should be strategic, not procedural. Describe *what* to do and *why* it works, leaving *how* for implementation guides. %%

### Implementation Considerations

%% What should practitioners consider when applying this pattern? Variations for different contexts, common pitfalls, prerequisites, and adaptation guidelines. %%
