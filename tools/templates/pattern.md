# <% tp.frontmatter.title || "Pattern Name" %>

_<% tp.frontmatter.description || "A conceptual framework that provides reusable solutions to common challenges in decentralized organization design and governance." %>_

## Context

%% Describe the environments or situations where this pattern applies. Include types of organizations, networks, or communities that might benefit from this pattern, emphasizing the broader organizational context beyond specific operational procedures. %%

## Challenges

%% Identify the specific organizational challenges this pattern addresses. Focus on systemic issues, coordination problems, or design challenges that require conceptual solutions rather than step-by-step procedures. %%

## Solution Framework

%% Explain the conceptual approach this pattern provides. Describe the key principles, mechanisms, and components that make this pattern effective. This should be more strategic and less procedural than protocol documentation. %%

## Implementation Considerations

%% Provide guidance for applying this pattern across different contexts: %%

### Governance Implications
%% How this pattern affects decision-making and authority structures %%

### Cultural Factors  
%% How organizational culture shapes pattern implementation %%

### Technical Integration
%% How this pattern interfaces with tools and technical systems %%

### Scale Adaptations
%% How the pattern functions differently at various organizational scales %%

### Protocol Dependencies
%% What operational protocols are needed to implement this pattern effectively %%

## References and Resources

%% List relevant documentation, articles, research, tools, or templates %%

### Examples

%% Provide examples showing this pattern's application across different contexts %%

### Related Patterns

%% Connect to complementary or contrasting patterns %%

---

### Supporting Protocols

%% Connect to related protocols that operationalize this pattern %%

### Supporting Primitives

```dataviewjs
const ext = dv.pages('"tools/types"')
    .where(t => t.extends === "primitive")
    .map(t => t.file.name);

dv.table(
    ["Primitive", "Description"],
    dv.pages()
        .where(p => 
            p.type && 
            (p.type.includes("primitive") || ext.some(n => p.type.includes(n))) &&
            dv.current().primitives && dv.current().primitives.includes(p.file.name) &&
            !p.file.path.startsWith("tools/") && 
            !p.file.path.startsWith("drafts/")
        )
        .sort(p => p.title, 'asc')
        .map(p => [
            `**[${p.title}](${p.file.path})**`,  
            p.description
        ])
);
```

### Case Studies

```dataview
LIST description
WHERE (
    (contains(patterns, this.file.name) OR patterns = this.file.name)
) 
AND (
    contains(type, "study") OR type = "study"
)
AND (
    !contains(file.path, "tools/") 
    AND !contains(file.path, "drafts/")
)
