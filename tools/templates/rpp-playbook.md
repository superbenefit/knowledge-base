%% IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR PLAYBOOK AUTHOR:

This template is designed to work with the execution strategy outputs:

1. XML Integration: Each section references specific XML outputs from the strategy phases. When assembling the playbook, extract content from these structured outputs.

2. Progressive Disclosure: The template follows the 0‚Üí0.5‚Üí1 progression identified in the strategy, allowing readers to engage at their comfort level.

3. Multiple Entry Points: Quick wins, patterns, implementation guides, and case studies all serve as potential starting points based on reader needs.

4. Cross-Referencing: Heavy use of internal links to create multiple navigation paths through the content.

5. Validation: Each section should be checked against the QA criteria from Phase 6 for reading level, jargon, and audience alignment.

6. Living Document: The Connect & Evolve section implements the feedback framework from Phase 6, Task 6.2.

Remember to validate against original context document throughout assembly!
