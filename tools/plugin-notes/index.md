## Using Plugins

Plugins extend the functionality of Obsidian. This vault relies on a combination of core and community plugins to support content creation, metadata management, and querying. In most cases, changes to plugins and other Obsidian settings will not affect the underlying markdown files.

## Core Plugins

Several core plugins are used to organize and edit the content of this vault. These are built into Obsidian and can be toggled on or off in Settings > Core plugins.

You can enable, disable, or replace core plugins to suit your workflow.

### Core Plugins Currently In-Use

These core plugins are required for the basic functions of our vault. Disabling them will cause some things to behave unexpectedly.

You can use community plugins to customize Obsidian's features to suit your workflow.
