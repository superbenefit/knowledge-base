## Relationship Types Documented

### 1. Pattern → Primitive (Implementation)
**Example**: cell-state.md → nucleus.md + circle.md
- **Forward**: Pattern explains how it uses primitive
- **Backlink**: Primitive lists patterns that implement it
- **Section**: "Implementation in Patterns"

### 2. Pattern → Pattern (Composition)
**Example**: cell.md → cell-state.md
- **Forward**: Higher-level pattern uses component
- **Backlink**: Component shows where it's used
- **Section**: "Related Concepts"

### 3. Any → Lexicon (Definitional)
**Example**: All content → governance, coordination, teams, etc.
- **Forward**: First meaningful use links to definition
- **Backlink**: Lexicon shows usage examples
- **Section**: Inline + "Related Concepts"

### 4. Primitive ↔ Primitive (Complementary)
**Example**: nucleus ↔ circle
- **Relationship**: Work together in same contexts
- **Linking**: Mutual "Related Concepts" references

### 5. Library → Internal (Connection)
**Example**: Library entries → lexicon + patterns
- **Purpose**: Connect external resources to internal concepts
- **Section**: "Related Concepts"

## Quality Principles Applied

### ✅ DO:
- Link first meaningful use of concepts
- Add "Related Concepts" sections for exploration
- Keep link density at ~1 per 2-3 sentences in prose max
- Ensure every link genuinely aids understanding
- Make relationships bidirectional
- Use consistent section naming

### ❌ DON'T:
- Link every instance of a term
- Over-saturate body text
- Create circular immediate references
- Link obvious terms in context
- Add links that don't serve understanding
- Create metadata/content mismatches

### Quality Metrics Achieved:
✅ Natural reading flow maintained
✅ No over-saturated paragraphs
✅ All links serve understanding
✅ Bidirectional relationships clear
✅ Discoverable from any entry point
✅ Consistent structure across files
