# Full Knowledge Base Rollout Plan

**Goal**: Systematically apply backlinking patterns across entire knowledge base
**Based on**: Experiments 1 & 2 learnings
**Date**: 2025-11-18

---

## Scope Inventory

### Already Complete ✅
- Lexicon: daos.md, teams.md, primitives.md, coordination.md (partial)
- Primitives: nucleus.md, circle.md
- Patterns: cell-state.md, community-governance.md (artifacts)

### To Do

**Phase 1: DAO Primitives Patterns (Priority)**
1. cell.md (artifacts) - referenced by nucleus, circle
2. operational-governance.md (artifacts) - referenced by circle
3. multi-stakeholder-governance.md (notes/dao-primitives) - governance cluster
4. community-governance.md (notes/dao-primitives) - governance cluster
5. dao-state.md (notes/dao-primitives) - state cluster

**Phase 2: Additional Artifact Patterns**
6. cell-state-template.md
7. gatherings.md
8. decider-protocol.md
9. fiscal-bridge-pattern.md
10. knowledge-gardens.md
11. poetic-harvesting.md
12. progressive-web3-adoption.md
13. tokenized-funds.md

**Phase 3: Library Entries** (~40 files)
- Add "Related Concepts" sections
- Link to relevant lexicon terms

**Phase 4: Remaining Lexicon Entries** (~100+ files)
- Add "Related Concepts" where missing
- Ensure "Used In" or "Examples" sections

**Phase 5: Final Audit**
- Broken link check
- Bidirectional relationship verification
- Consistency check

## Rollout Strategy

### Batch Processing
- Work in batches of 3-5 related files
- Commit after each batch
- Document patterns discovered

### Quality Checkpoints
- After each phase, review sample files
- Adjust approach if needed
- Update documentation

### Time Estimates
- Phase 1: ~2 hours (5 patterns, high priority)
- Phase 2: ~2-3 hours (8 patterns)
- Phase 3: ~3-4 hours (40 library entries)
- Phase 4: ~4-5 hours (100+ lexicon entries)
- Phase 5: ~1-2 hours (audit)
- **Total**: ~12-16 hours of systematic work

## Current Status
Starting Phase 1 with highest-priority patterns.
