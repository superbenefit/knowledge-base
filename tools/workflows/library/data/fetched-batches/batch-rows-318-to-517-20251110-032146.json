      "content": "## [\\#](https://docs.kalidao.xyz/faq/\\#what-is-kali) What is KALI?\n\nKALI is an application to simplify DAO and legal structuring. It includes end-to-end tokenization, voting, and legal support such as LLC formation and agreement drafting software.\n\n## [\\#](https://docs.kalidao.xyz/faq/\\#what-is-a-dao) What is a DAO?\n\nA DAO is like a shared bank account, but operated by code or “smart contracts”.\n\n## [\\#](https://docs.kalidao.xyz/faq/\\#what-is-a-smart-contract) What is a Smart Contract?\n\nA smart contract is code on a blockchain that will run exactly as programmed. They can manage assets without inference and for DAOs, enforce proposals, such as membership and payments. Smart contracts deployed on KALI will survive the platform, don’t depend on KALI developers, and will persist as long as blockchains run. Smart contracts therefore give KALI users true ownership of their organizations.\n\n## [\\#](https://docs.kalidao.xyz/faq/\\#why-do-daos-need-legal-structure) Why do DAOs need Legal Structure?\n\nDAOs are managed by people, and as they typically involve the pooling and use of assets, can create traditional legal liabilities for all involved parties. Without a formal legal structure, jurisdictions may treat DAOs as unincorporated general partnerships, giving members joint and several liability for claims made against the DAO. This effectively means that a single member could be held responsible for the entire sum of damages in the event of unfavourable litigation. Limiting the liability of DAOs through light-weight legal structures has therefore been seen as a common sense solution to scale and operate with “IRL” concerns, such as hiring and making investments.\n\n## [\\#](https://docs.kalidao.xyz/faq/\\#how-does-kali-provide-legal-support) How does KALI provide Legal Support?\n\nKALI allows users to immediately wrap their DAO in a Delaware LLC, as a “child” of the [KaliCo Ricardian Series LLCopen in new window](https://docs.kalidao.xyz/#kalico-ricardian-llc). Effectively, each DAO will have its own rights and liability protection, separate and apart from each other, enforced by Delaware law and under the terms of the [LLC master operating agreementopen in new window](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmdHFNxtecmCNcTscWJqnA4AiASyk3SHCgKamugLHqR23i).\n\nAdditionally, KALI integrates with a community of legal and knowledge service providers, [LexDAOopen in new window](https://www.lexdao.coop/#/directory), and can assist with formation and compliance through its contact form and referral network.\n\n## [\\#](https://docs.kalidao.xyz/faq/\\#what-should-i-be-thinking-about-when-i-create-a-dao) What should I be thinking about when I create a DAO?\n\nThe more consideration as to the needs and structure of your DAO at the start, the fewer changes may be required in the future through proposals (which will reduce gas fees and decision friction).\n\nThe most important considerations to make (other than, of course, your DAO name and symbol) are:\n\n- Who are the founders?;\n- What are their fair token allocations?;\n- What voting procedures should the DAO operate by?; and\n- Do you want to establish your DAO with a legal wrapper? _KALI and LexDAO recommend that you discuss this decision with a legal and tax expert prior to establishing your DAO_.\n\n## [\\#](https://docs.kalidao.xyz/faq/\\#how-do-i-create-my-dao) How do I create my DAO?\n\n### [\\#](https://docs.kalidao.xyz/faq/\\#select-a-chain) Select a chain\n\nDifferent networks may provide security, speed, and fee advantages.

This poll will be up for 48 hours and operates in an optimistic manner - proposals are assumed to pass unless 25% of the contributor base votes no OR 25% of the Governing Council votes no. ‘No’ votes are required to come with a written dissent, explaining the vote.\n\nIf the proposal is vetoed, the author is given a chance to edit the proposal based on the dissenting opinion(s) and post it back to the forum, entering another 48 hour period for feedback.\n\nIf it passes, the proposal will move to the Governing Council for ratification.\n\nThe Governing Council will then have 48 hours to vote.\n\nIf a DAO member holds the governor badge in addition to the contributor badge, they must also post a proposal on the forum for feedback, but can bypass the Snapshot poll as long as there is no opposition on the forum. These proposals will be sent directly from the forum to the Governance Council to ratify and vote on.

If three contributors file a complaint about a member, the issue will be brought up to the Governing Council which will then examine the case and vote on whether to retain the contributor or begin the offboarding process. If complaints come from members of the Governing Council, these members will recuse themselves from the examination and voting process.\n\nIf a leadership or contributor position needs to be filled mid-season, the Governing Council will appoint a member to the position with the input of contributors. This intermediary will only be assigned the position till the end of the season, at which point the position will be filled through normal processes.\n\nAll votes settled by 1wins51\n\n### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.metricsdao.xyz/operations/constitution\\#section-iv-submitting-amendments-to-the-constitution)    **Section IV - Submitting Amendments to the constitution**\n\nAny DAO member who holds the Governor badge can post an amendment proposal to the forum, which will start a 5 day period for feedback.\n\nThe Genesis Council will hold a poll for each draft amendment, with polling conducted during the following off-season.\n\nIf contradictory amendments exist for a given Section, only one can be implemented for the upcoming Season.\n\nPolls will be open for 48 hours, 1wins51.\n\n## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.metricsdao.xyz/operations/constitution\\#amendments)    Amendments\n\n### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.metricsdao.xyz/operations/constitution\\#amendment-i-incorporation-and-bylaws)    Amendment I - Incorporation and Bylaws\n\nIn July of 2022, MetricsDAO was formally incorporated as MetricsDAO Assoc, a non-stock, non-profit Delaware corporation. As part of the incorporation process, MetricsDAO voted to ratify a set of bylaws that formally outline the purpose of MetricsDAO, requirements for membership, and responsibilities of members and designated leaders within the organization.\n\nIn addition to ratifying the bylaws, MetricsDAO appointed Daphne Kwon to be designated as the first signatory on behalf of MetricsDAO. This signatory has the authority to sign contracts and other legally binding documents on behalf of MetricsDAO. The signatory is not a permanent position and may be replaced by the DAO following a proposal put forward and voted on by members of the Governing Council.\n\nThe full bylaws can be viewed here: [MetricsDAO Bylaws](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LItjh_igK1KMMcx4L35RKuaQ7eh23x99/view)\n\n[PreviousNetwork List](https://docs.metricsdao.xyz/networks/network-list) [NextTeam Structure](https://docs.metricsdao.xyz/operations/team-structure)\n\nLast updated 3 years ago\n\nWas this helpful?",

      "content": "# [\\#](https://docs.octant.app/en-EN/how-it-works.html\\#how-octant-works) How Octant works\n\nThis article describes Octant's rationale and mechanics, if you want to know how to use the app, clik [here](https://docs.octant.app/en-EN/using-the-app.html).\n\n## [\\#](https://docs.octant.app/en-EN/how-it-works.html\\#overview-and-rationale) Overview and rationale\n\nWith the [Ethereum switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake(opens new window)](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/) consensus mechanism, the [Golem Foundation(opens new window)](https://golem.foundation/), which is developing Octant, has decided to become a [validator in the network(opens new window)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/#validators). The Foundation has staked 100,000 ETH to secure the network and assist in reaching consensus.\n\nIn exchange for staking its Ether and serving as a validator, the Foundation receives a steady stream of [rewards directly from the protocol(opens new window)](https://etherscan.io/address/0xba1951dF0C0A52af23857c5ab48B4C43A57E7ed1). A portion of these staking rewards is transferred to the Octant community every 90 days. Community members then decide, through individual actions and polls, how to allocate these funds. They can choose to either claim a portion of the reward for themselves or donate it to qualifying public goods causes.\n\nThrough this initiative, the Golem Foundation aims to gather empirical evidence on user participation in decentralized governance. This information will guide [our search for effective decentralized governance solutions(opens new window)](https://golem.foundation/2021/12/16/udo1.html) and further the development of the [User-Defined Organization(opens new window)](https://golem.foundation/2021/12/16/udo2.html) project.\n\n## [\\#](https://docs.octant.app/en-EN/how-it-works.html\\#the-distribution-of-the-golem-foundation-s-staking-yield) The distribution of the Golem Foundation's staking yield\n\nInitially, the transfer of staking rewards from the Golem Foundation to Octant depended on [the percentage of the total GLM supply locked by Octant users(opens new window)](https://octantapp.notion.site/Octant-a-GLM-Governance-Experiment-e098d7ff9d55468db28b8b3584b5959c) — the more GLM locked in the Octant contract, the greater the portion of the Foundation’s staking rewards directed to the Octant community. However, [in Epoch Three, we shifted to a predetermined split(opens new window)](https://blog.octant.build/octants-algorithm-overhaul/):\n\n- 70% of the staking yield contributes to Octant's Total Rewards budget, split evenly between User Rewards and Matched Rewards.\n- 25% of the staking yield goes to the Golem Foundation, helping cover expenses like validator management, Octant administration, development, marketing, and other initiatives.\n- 5% of the staking yield bolsters the Octant Community Fund.\n\n## [\\#](https://docs.octant.app/en-EN/how-it-works.html\\#governance-over-octant-s-total-rewards-budget) Governance over Octant's Total Rewards Budget\n\nAnyone holding [GLM tokens(opens new window)](https://octant.build/glm-token/) (the ERC-20 token native to the [Golem Network(opens new window)](https://golem.network/)) can become part of the Octant community by [locking a certain minimum amount of their tokens in the Octant contract](https://docs.octant.app/en-EN/glm-locking.html). It's possible to lock as little as 1 GLM, but a minimum effective balance of 100 GLM is required to qualify for user rewards.\n\nThe GLM-locking mechanism is non-custodial. Tokens locked by users aren't pooled with others' funds. Users maintain full control over their funds and can unlock their GLM at any time.\n\nGovernance of the Total Rewards budget occurs through a cyclical process known as 'epochs,' each spanning 90 days, although this duration is subject to potential adjustments.\n\nEach epoch starts with the Octant community selecting eligible public goods projects for funding. (Details on eligibility and how to submit a project are in the [Propose a project](https://docs.octant.app/en-EN/propose-a-project.html) section.)\n\nDuring an epoch, users with at least 100 GLM in effective locked balance earn ETH rewards. The distribution of rewards is linear: the percentage of the total GLM supply a user locks in Octant corresponds directly to their percentage of User Rewards.\n\nUser Rewards for GLM lockers are further enhanced by the Participation Promotion Fund (PPF), [introduced in Epoch 3(opens new window)](https://blog.octant.build/octants-algorithm-overhaul/). Half of the PPF boosts ETH rewards, with the rest earmarked for a special GLM incentive. (This fund will provide incremental boosts to User Rewards and will decrease periodically as more GLM is locked, phasing out completely at a 35% lock-in rate.)\n\nUser Rewards are determined by a time-weighted average: the more GLM locked and the longer it remains, the greater the User Reward. Users can adjust their lock amount during an epoch; however, reducing a lock recalibrates the time-weighted average to the smallest amount locked.\n\nAn epoch is followed by a two-week allocation window, during which users can:\n\n- Claim the rewards for themselves,\n- Donate all or a portion to any of the shortlisted public goods projects,\n- Allocate them to the Octant Matching Fund via [Patron mode](https://docs.octant.app/en-EN/using-the-app.html#patron-mode).\n\nDonations from User Rewards to projects are potentially increased by Octant's Matched Rewards, calculated using a [quadratic funding formula](https://docs.octant.app/en-EN/quadratic-funding.html). This formula considers both the number of unique contributors and the amount donated, giving more weight to projects with broad community support.\n\nThe matching multiplier for each donation depends on [the user's Passport XYZ score](https://docs.octant.app/en-EN/quadratic-funding.html#verifying-uniqueness). Users with a score of 15 or higher receive the maximum matching multiplier, while those with lower scores have their donations scaled down as an anti-Sybil measure.\n\nTo ensure a balanced distribution of funds, a maximum funding cap is set at 20% of the total Matched Rewards fund (including funds from Patron mode). Users can still donate to projects that have reached this cap, but these donations will not receive additional matching from the Matched Rewards pool.\n\nPost-allocation window:\n\n- Users opting to claim rewards can transfer ETH to their wallets.\n- Projects can withdraw community donations.\n- Rewards not claimed or allocated, are returned to the Golem Foundation.\n\nFor insights into the Octant App’s functionality and how to participate, consult the [Using the App](https://docs.octant.app/en-EN/using-the-app.html) section.\n\nFor a detailed explanation of reward and matched fund calculations, refer to Octant’s [Technical Outline](https://docs.octant.app/en-EN/technical-outline.html).\n\n←\n[Introduction](https://docs.octant.app/en-EN/)[Using the app](https://docs.octant.app/en-EN/using-the-app.html)\n→",

Click here to visit latest version.](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/governance)\n\nCopy Markdown\n\n[AnthropicOpen in Claude](https://claude.ai/new?q=Read+loading%2C+I+want+to+ask+questions+about+it.)\n\nIn this guide we will learn how OpenZeppelin’s Governor contract works, how to set it up, and how to use it to create proposals, vote for them, and execute them, using tools provided by Ethers.js and Tally.\n\nFind detailed contract documentation at [Governance API](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/governance).\n\n## [Introduction](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#introduction)\n\nDecentralized protocols are in constant evolution from the moment they are publicly released. Often, the initial team retains control of this evolution in the first stages, but eventually delegates it to a community of stakeholders. The process by which this community makes decisions is called on-chain governance, and it has become a central component of decentralized protocols, fueling varied decisions such as parameter tweaking, smart contract upgrades, integrations with other protocols, treasury management, grants, etc.\n\nThis governance protocol is generally implemented in a special-purpose contract called “Governor”. The GovernorAlpha and GovernorBravo contracts designed by Compound have been very successful and popular so far, with the downside that projects with different requirements have had to fork the code to customize it for their needs, which can pose a high risk of introducing security issues. For OpenZeppelin Contracts, we set out to build a modular system of Governor contracts so that forking is not needed, and different requirements can be accommodated by writing small modules using Solidity inheritance. You will find the most common requirements out of the box in OpenZeppelin Contracts, but writing additional ones is simple, and we will be adding new features as requested by the community in future releases. Additionally, the design of OpenZeppelin Governor requires minimal use of storage and results in more gas efficient operation.\n\n## [Compatibility](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#compatibility)\n\nOpenZeppelin’s Governor system was designed with a concern for compatibility with existing systems that were based on Compound’s GovernorAlpha and GovernorBravo. Because of this, you will find that many modules are presented in two variants, one of which is built for compatibility with those systems.\n\n### [ERC20Votes & ERC20VotesComp](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#erc20votes--erc20votescomp)\n\nThe ERC20 extension to keep track of votes and vote delegation is one such case. The shorter one is the more generic version because it can support token supplies greater than 2^96, while the “Comp” variant is limited in that regard, but exactly fits the interface of the COMP token that is used by GovernorAlpha and Bravo. Both contract variants share the same events, so they are fully compatible when looking at events only.\n\n### [Governor & GovernorCompatibilityBravo](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#governor--governorcompatibilitybravo)\n\nAn OpenZeppelin Governor contract is by default not interface-compatible with Compound’s GovernorAlpha or Bravo. Even though events are fully compatible, proposal lifecycle functions (creation, execution, etc.) have different signatures that are meant to optimize storage use. Other functions from GovernorAlpha are Bravo are likewise not available. It’s possible to opt in to a higher level of compatibility by inheriting from the GovernorCompatibilityBravo module, which covers the proposal lifecycle functions such as `propose` and `execute`.\n\nNote that even with the use of this module, there will still be differences in the way that `proposalId`s are calculated. Governor uses the hash of the proposal parameters with the purpose of keeping its data off-chain by event indexing, while the original Bravo implementation uses sequential `proposalId`s. Due to this and other differences, several of the functions from GovernorBravo are not included in the compatibility module.\n\n### [GovernorTimelockControl & GovernorTimelockCompound](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#governortimelockcontrol--governortimelockcompound)\n\nWhen using a timelock with your Governor contract, you can use either OpenZeppelin’s TimelockController or Compound’s Timelock. Based on the choice of timelock, you should choose the corresponding Governor module: GovernorTimelockControl or GovernorTimelockCompound respectively. This allows you to migrate an existing GovernorAlpha instance to an OpenZeppelin-based Governor without changing the timelock in use.\n\n### [Tally](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#tally)\n\n[Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/) is a full-fledged application for user owned on-chain governance. It comprises a voting dashboard, proposal creation wizard, real time research and analysis, and educational content.\n\nFor all of these options, the Governor will be compatible with Tally: users will be able to create proposals, visualize voting power and advocates, navigate proposals, and cast votes. For proposal creation in particular, projects can also use Defender Admin as an alternative interface.\n\nIn the rest of this guide, we will focus on a fresh deploy of the vanilla OpenZeppelin Governor features without concern for compatibility with GovernorAlpha or Bravo.\n\n## [Setup](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#setup)\n\n### [Token](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#token)\n\nThe voting power of each account in our governance setup will be determined by an ERC20 token. The token has to implement the ERC20Votes extension. This extension will keep track of historical balances so that voting power is retrieved from past snapshots rather than current balance, which is an important protection that prevents double voting.\n\n```\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.24;\n\nimport {ERC20} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\";\nimport {ERC20Permit} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Permit.sol\";\nimport {ERC20Votes} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Votes.sol\";\nimport {Nonces} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Nonces.sol\";\n\ncontract MyToken is ERC20, ERC20Permit, ERC20Votes {\n    constructor() ERC20(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\") ERC20Permit(\"MyToken\") {}\n\n    // The functions below are overrides required by Solidity.\n\n    function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override(ERC20, ERC20Votes) {\n        super._update(from, to, amount);\n    }\n\n    function nonces(address owner) public view virtual override(ERC20Permit, Nonces) returns (uint256) {\n        return super.nonces(owner);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf your project already has a live token that does not include ERC20Votes and is not upgradeable, you can wrap it in a governance token by using ERC20Wrapper. This will allow token holders to participate in governance by wrapping their tokens 1-to-1.\n\n```\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.24;\n\nimport {IERC20, ERC20} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\";\nimport {ERC20Permit} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Permit.sol\";\nimport {ERC20Votes} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Votes.sol\";\nimport {ERC20Wrapper} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Wrapper.sol\";\nimport {Nonces} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Nonces.sol\";\n\ncontract MyTokenWrapped is ERC20, ERC20Permit, ERC20Votes, ERC20Wrapper {\n    constructor(\n        IERC20 wrappedToken\n    ) ERC20(\"MyTokenWrapped\", \"MTK\") ERC20Permit(\"MyTokenWrapped\") ERC20Wrapper(wrappedToken) {}\n\n    // The functions below are overrides required by Solidity.\n\n    function decimals() public view override(ERC20, ERC20Wrapper) returns (uint8) {\n        return super.decimals();\n    }\n\n    function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override(ERC20, ERC20Votes) {\n        super._update(from, to, amount);\n    }\n\n    function nonces(address owner) public view virtual override(ERC20Permit, Nonces) returns (uint256) {\n        return super.nonces(owner);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe only other source of voting power available in OpenZeppelin Contracts currently is [`ERC721Votes`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/ERC721#ERC721Votes). ERC721 tokens that don’t provide this functionality can be wrapped into a voting tokens using a combination of [`ERC721Votes`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/ERC721#ERC721Votes) and [`ERC721Wrapper`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/ERC721#ERC721Wrapper).\n\nThe internal clock used by the token to store voting balances will dictate the operating mode of the Governor contract attached to it. By default, block numbers are used. Since v4.9, developers can override the [IERC6372](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/interfaces#IERC6372) clock to use timestamps instead of block numbers.\n\n### [Governor](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#governor)\n\nInitially, we will build a Governor without a timelock. The core logic is given by the Governor contract, but we still need to choose: 1) how voting power is determined, 2) how many votes are needed for quorum, 3) what options people have when casting a vote and how those votes are counted, and 4) what type of token should be used to vote. Each of these aspects is customizable by writing your own module, or more easily choosing one from OpenZeppelin Contracts.\n\nFor 1) we will use the GovernorVotes module, which hooks to an IVotes instance to determine the voting power of an account based on the token balance they hold when a proposal becomes active. This module requires as a constructor parameter the address of the token. This module also discovers the clock mode (ERC6372) used by the token and applies it to the Governor.\n\nFor 2) we will use GovernorVotesQuorumFraction which works together with ERC20Votes to define quorum as a percentage of the total supply at the block a proposal’s voting power is retrieved. This requires a constructor parameter to set the percentage. Most Governors nowadays use 4%, so we will initialize the module with parameter 4 (this indicates the percentage, resulting in 4%).\n\nFor 3) we will use GovernorCountingSimple, a module that offers 3 options to voters: For, Against, and Abstain, and where only For and Abstain votes are counted towards quorum.\n\nBesides these modules, Governor itself has some parameters we must set.\n\nvotingDelay: How long after a proposal is created should voting power be fixed. A large voting delay gives users time to unstake tokens if necessary.\n\nvotingPeriod: How long does a proposal remain open to votes.\n\nThese parameters are specified in the unit defined in the token’s clock. Assuming the token uses block numbers, and assuming block time of around 12 seconds, we will have set votingDelay = 1 day = 7200 blocks, and votingPeriod = 1 week = 50400 blocks.\n\nWe can optionally set a proposal threshold as well. This restricts proposal creation to accounts who have enough voting power.\n\n```\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.24;\n\nimport {Governor} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/Governor.sol\";\nimport {GovernorCountingSimple} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorCountingSimple.sol\";\nimport {GovernorVotes} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorVotes.sol\";\nimport {GovernorVotesQuorumFraction} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorVotesQuorumFraction.sol\";\nimport {GovernorTimelockControl} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorTimelockControl.sol\";\nimport {TimelockController} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/TimelockController.sol\";\nimport {IVotes} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/utils/IVotes.sol\";\n\ncontract MyGovernor is\n    Governor,\n    GovernorCountingSimple,\n    GovernorVotes,\n    GovernorVotesQuorumFraction,\n    GovernorTimelockControl\n{\n    constructor(\n        IVotes _token,\n        TimelockController _timelock\n    ) Governor(\"MyGovernor\") GovernorVotes(_token) GovernorVotesQuorumFraction(4) GovernorTimelockControl(_timelock) {}\n\n    function votingDelay() public pure override returns (uint256) {\n        return 7200; // 1 day\n    }\n\n    function votingPeriod() public pure override returns (uint256) {\n        return 50400; // 1 week\n    }\n\n    function proposalThreshold() public pure override returns (uint256) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    // The functions below are overrides required by Solidity.\n\n    function state(uint256 proposalId) public view override(Governor, GovernorTimelockControl) returns (ProposalState) {\n        return super.state(proposalId);\n    }\n\n    function proposalNeedsQueuing(\n        uint256 proposalId\n    ) public view virtual override(Governor, GovernorTimelockControl) returns (bool) {\n        return super.proposalNeedsQueuing(proposalId);\n    }\n\n    function _queueOperations(\n        uint256 proposalId,\n        address[] memory targets,\n        uint256[] memory values,\n        bytes[] memory calldatas,\n        bytes32 descriptionHash\n    ) internal override(Governor, GovernorTimelockControl) returns (uint48) {\n        return super._queueOperations(proposalId, targets, values, calldatas, descriptionHash);\n    }\n\n    function _executeOperations(\n        uint256 proposalId,\n        address[] memory targets,\n        uint256[] memory values,\n        bytes[] memory calldatas,\n        bytes32 descriptionHash\n    ) internal override(Governor, GovernorTimelockControl) {\n        super._executeOperations(proposalId, targets, values, calldatas, descriptionHash);\n    }\n\n    function _cancel(\n        address[] memory targets,\n        uint256[] memory values,\n        bytes[] memory calldatas,\n        bytes32 descriptionHash\n    ) internal override(Governor, GovernorTimelockControl) returns (uint256) {\n        return super._cancel(targets, values, calldatas, descriptionHash);\n    }\n\n    function _executor() internal view override(Governor, GovernorTimelockControl) returns (address) {\n        return super._executor();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### [Timelock](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#timelock)\n\nIt is good practice to add a timelock to governance decisions. This allows users to exit the system if they disagree with a decision before it is executed. We will use OpenZeppelin’s TimelockController in combination with the GovernorTimelockControl module.\n\nWhen using a timelock, it is the timelock that will execute proposals and thus the timelock that should hold any funds, ownership, and access control roles. Before version 4.5 there was no way to recover funds in the Governor contract when using a timelock! Before version 4.3, when using the Compound Timelock, ETH in the timelock was not easily accessible.\n\nTimelockController uses an AccessControl setup that we need to understand in order to set up roles.\n\n- The Proposer role is in charge of queueing operations: this is the role the Governor instance should be granted, and it should likely be the only proposer in the system.\n- The Executor role is in charge of executing already available operations: we can assign this role to the special zero address to allow anyone to execute (if operations can be particularly time sensitive, the Governor should be made Executor instead).\n- Lastly, there is the Admin role, which can grant and revoke the two previous roles: this is a very sensitive role that will be granted automatically to the timelock itself, and optionally to a second account, which can be used for ease of setup but should promptly renounce the role.\n\n## [Proposal Lifecycle](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#proposal-lifecycle)\n\nLet’s walk through how to create and execute a proposal on our newly deployed Governor.\n\nA proposal is a sequence of actions that the Governor contract will perform if it passes. Each action consists of a target address, calldata encoding a function call, and an amount of ETH to include. Additionally, a proposal includes a human-readable description.\n\n### [Create a Proposal](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#create-a-proposal)\n\nLet’s say we want to create a proposal to give a team a grant, in the form of ERC20 tokens from the governance treasury. This proposal will consist of a single action where the target is the ERC20 token, calldata is the encoded function call `transfer(<team wallet>, <grant amount>)`, and with 0 ETH attached.\n\nGenerally a proposal will be created with the help of an interface such as Tally or Defender. Here we will show how to create the proposal using Ethers.js.\n\nFirst we get all the parameters necessary for the proposal action.\n\n```\nconst tokenAddress = ...;\nconst token = await ethers.getContractAt(‘ERC20’, tokenAddress);\n\nconst teamAddress = ...;\nconst grantAmount = ...;\nconst transferCalldata = token.interface.encodeFunctionData(‘transfer’, [teamAddress, grantAmount]);\n```\n\nNow we are ready to call the propose function of the Governor. Note that we don’t pass in one array of actions, but instead three arrays corresponding to the list of targets, the list of values, and the list of calldatas. In this case it’s a single action, so it’s simple:\n\n```\nawait governor.propose(\n  [tokenAddress],\n  [0],\n  [transferCalldata],\n  “Proposal #1: Give grant to team”,\n);\n```\n\nThis will create a new proposal, with a proposal id that is obtained by hashing together the proposal data, and which will also be found in an event in the logs of the transaction.\n\n### [Cast a Vote](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#cast-a-vote)\n\nOnce a proposal is active, delegates can cast their vote. Note that it is delegates who carry voting power: if a token holder wants to participate, they can set a trusted representative as their delegate, or they can become a delegate themselves by self-delegating their voting power.\n\nVotes are cast by interacting with the Governor contract through the `castVote` family of functions. Voters would generally invoke this from a governance UI such as Tally.\n\n![Voting in Tally](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/tally-vote.png)\n\n### [Execute the Proposal](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#execute-the-proposal)\n\nOnce the voting period is over, if quorum was reached (enough voting power participated) and the majority voted in favor, the proposal is considered successful and can proceed to be executed. Once a proposal passes, it can be queued and executed from the same place you voted.\n\n![Administration Panel in Tally](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/tally-exec.png)\n\nWe will see now how to do this manually using Ethers.js.\n\nIf a timelock was set up, the first step to execution is queueing. You will notice that both the queue and execute functions require passing in the entire proposal parameters, as opposed to just the proposal id. This is necessary because this data is not stored on chain, as a measure to save gas. Note that these parameters can always be found in the events emitted by the contract. The only parameter that is not sent in its entirety is the description, since this is only needed in its hashed form to compute the proposal id.\n\nTo queue, we call the queue function:\n\n```\nconst descriptionHash = ethers.utils.id(“Proposal #1: Give grant to team”);\n\nawait governor.queue(\n  [tokenAddress],\n  [0],\n  [transferCalldata],\n  descriptionHash,\n);\n```\n\nThis will cause the Governor to interact with the timelock contract and queue the actions for execution after the required delay.\n\nAfter enough time has passed (according to the timelock parameters), the proposal can be executed. If there was no timelock to begin with, this step can be ran immediately after the proposal succeeds.\n\n```\nawait governor.execute(\n  [tokenAddress],\n  [0],\n  [transferCalldata],\n  descriptionHash,\n);\n```\n\nExecuting the proposal will transfer the ERC20 tokens to the chosen recipient. To wrap up: we set up a system where a treasury is controlled by the collective decision of the token holders of a project, and all actions are executed via proposals enforced by on-chain votes.\n\n## [Timestamp based governance](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#timestamp-based-governance)\n\n### [Motivation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#motivation)\n\nIt is sometimes difficult to deal with durations expressed in number of blocks because of inconsistent or unpredictable time between blocks. This is particularly true of some L2 networks where blocks are produced based on blockchain usage. Using number of blocks can also lead to the governance rules being affected by network upgrades that modify the expected time between blocks.\n\nThe difficulty of replacing block numbers with timestamps is that the Governor and the token must both use the same format when querying past votes. If a token is designed around block numbers, it is not possible for a Governor to reliably do timestamp based lookups.\n\nTherefore, designing a timestamp based voting system starts with the token.\n\n### [Token](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#token-1)\n\nSince v4.9, all voting contracts (including [`ERC20Votes`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/ERC20#ERC20Votes) and [`ERC721Votes`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/ERC721#ERC721Votes)) rely on [IERC6372](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/interfaces#IERC6372) for clock management. In order to change from operating with block numbers to operating with timestamps, all that is required is to override the `clock()` and `CLOCK_MODE()` functions.\n\n```\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.24;\n\nimport {ERC20} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\";\nimport {ERC20Permit} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Permit.sol\";\nimport {ERC20Votes} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Votes.sol\";\nimport {Nonces} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Nonces.sol\";\n\ncontract MyTokenTimestampBased is ERC20, ERC20Permit, ERC20Votes {\n    constructor() ERC20(\"MyTokenTimestampBased\", \"MTK\") ERC20Permit(\"MyTokenTimestampBased\") {}\n\n    // Overrides IERC6372 functions to make the token & governor timestamp-based\n\n    function clock() public view override returns (uint48) {\n        return uint48(block.timestamp);\n    }\n\n    // solhint-disable-next-line func-name-mixedcase\n    function CLOCK_MODE() public pure override returns (string memory) {\n        return \"mode=timestamp\";\n    }\n\n    // The functions below are overrides required by Solidity.\n\n    function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override(ERC20, ERC20Votes) {\n        super._update(from, to, amount);\n    }\n\n    function nonces(address owner) public view virtual override(ERC20Permit, Nonces) returns (uint256) {\n        return super.nonces(owner);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### [Governor](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#governor-1)\n\nThe Governor will automatically detect the clock mode used by the token and adapt to it. There is no need to override anything in the Governor contract. However, the clock mode does affect how some values are interpreted. It is therefore necessary to set the `votingDelay()` and `votingPeriod()` accordingly.\n\n```\npragma solidity ^0.8.2;\n\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/Governor.sol\";\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/compatibility/GovernorCompatibilityBravo.sol\";\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorVotes.sol\";\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorVotesQuorumFraction.sol\";\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorTimelockControl.sol\";\n\ncontract MyGovernor is Governor, GovernorCompatibilityBravo, GovernorVotes, GovernorVotesQuorumFraction, GovernorTimelockControl\n    constructor(IVotes _token, TimelockController _timelock)\n        Governor(\"MyGovernor\")\n        GovernorVotes(_token)\n        GovernorVotesQuorumFraction(4)\n        GovernorTimelockControl(_timelock)\n    {\n\n    function votingDelay() public pure virtual override returns (uint256)\n        return 1 days;\n\n    function votingPeriod() public pure virtual override returns (uint256)\n        return 1 weeks;\n\n    function proposalThreshold() public pure virtual override returns (uint256)\n        return 0;\n\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n### [Disclaimer](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\\#disclaimer)\n\nTimestamp based voting is a recent feature that was formalized in EIP-6372 and EIP-5805, and introduced in v4.9. At the time this feature is released, governance tooling such as [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/) does not support it yet. While support for timestamps should come soon, users can expect invalid reporting of deadlines & durations. This invalid reporting by offchain tools does not affect the onchain security and functionality of the governance contract.\n\nGovernors with timestamp support (v4.9 and above) are compatible with old tokens (before v4.9) and will operate in \"block number\" mode (which is the mode all old tokens operate on). On the other hand, old Governor instances (before v4.9) are not compatible with new tokens operating using timestamps. If you update your token code to use timestamps, make sure to also update your Governor code.\n\n[Crosschain\\\\\n\\\\\nPrevious Page](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/crosschain) [Utilities\\\\\n\\\\\nNext Page](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/utilities)\n\n### On this page\n\n[Introduction](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#introduction) [Compatibility](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#compatibility) [ERC20Votes & ERC20VotesComp](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#erc20votes--erc20votescomp) [Governor & GovernorCompatibilityBravo](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#governor--governorcompatibilitybravo) [GovernorTimelockControl & GovernorTimelockCompound](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#governortimelockcontrol--governortimelockcompound) [Tally](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#tally) [Setup](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#setup) [Token](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#token) [Governor](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#governor) [Timelock](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#timelock) [Proposal Lifecycle](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#proposal-lifecycle) [Create a Proposal](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#create-a-proposal) [Cast a Vote](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#cast-a-vote) [Execute the Proposal](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#execute-the-proposal) [Timestamp based governance](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#timestamp-based-governance) [Motivation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#motivation) [Token](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#token-1) [Governor](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#governor-1) [Disclaimer](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#disclaimer)",

This setup can define if you are eligible to take part in the voting and what is your voting power calculated at the [snapshot of proposal creation](https://docs.snapshot.box/user-guides/create#snapshot-block-number).\n\nIn most cases you will be required to have a sufficient amount of tokens in the connected wallet at the time of proposal creation. One of the most common questions we receive on our support channels is [**Why can't I vote?**](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot/discussions/767)\n\nMore often than not the answer is - **you did not hold the sufficient amount of specified token at the time of proposal creation.**\n\n### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.snapshot.box/user-guides/voting/vote\\#voting-validation)    Voting validation\n\nAnother aspect determining whether you are eligible to vote or not is a [voting validation](https://docs.snapshot.box/user-guides/validation-strategies) defined by the space. It is a mechanism used to define certain conditions like minimum token balance or also to prevent [Sybil Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack). In other words the space owner wants to make sure that you are human and that bot or fake accounts are not used to overrule the outcome of the voting.\n\n## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.snapshot.box/user-guides/voting/vote\\#cast-a-vote)    Cast a vote\n\n1.

      "content": "## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.yam.finance/yam/governance\\#overview)    Overview\n\nYAM launched with fully decentralized governance from Day 1 by implementing the Compound governance module. This gives control of the protocol to YAM tokenholders, meaning that updates to the protocol and management of the treasury can only be performed with approval from YAM holders.\n\n## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.yam.finance/yam/governance\\#process)    Process\n\nThe governance process begins on [Yam Discord](https://discord.gg/RgHpsmShhE) where ideas are initially discussed. Once discussion has formalized a potential proposal it is submitted to [Yam Governance Forum](https://forum.yam.finance/). If the community signals its interest and any necessary modifications to the proposal are made, the proposal is submitted to [Snapshot off-chain governance](https://snapshot.page/#/yam), where tokenholders can vote with their token balances.\n\nIf a Snapshot proposal is passed and no code is required to be implemented, the approved action can be taken.\n\nIf code deployment is required, the code will go to audit if necessary, and then be proposed via on-chain governance at which point tokenholders will voteon-chain to deploy.\n\n### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.yam.finance/yam/governance\\#timeline)    Timeline\n\n[**Discord Ideation**:](https://discord.gg/hGsu5HD8dA) 1-3 days\n\n[**Forum Discussion**](https://forum.yam.finance/): 3+ days\n\n[**Snapshot Off-Chain Voting**](https://snapshot.page/#/yam.eth): 3 days\n\n[**On-chain Voting**](https://yam.finance/governance): 2 days\n\n**Execution Timelock**: 12 hours\n\n## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.yam.finance/yam/governance\\#delegation)    Delegation\n\nIn order to vote, you must [delegate your vote](https://yam.finance/governance) to yourself or to someone else. This applies to off-chain snapshot voting as well. Any YAM tokens being used as an LP in Yam's incentivizer farming Yams are automatically delegated to self. You can currently delegate to yourself via [yam.finance](https://yam.finance/governance), and we are working on an interface to delegate to other addresses. You can also delegate via [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0x0AaCfbeC6a24756c20D41914F2caba817C0d8521#writeContract) directly.\n\n## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.yam.finance/yam/governance\\#quorum)    Quorum\n\nFor a proposal to pass and be executed on-chain, it must reach \"minimum acceptance quorum,\" which means having 200,000 BoU YAM voting \"For\" the proposal, equivalent to 4% of the initial token supply. Quorum requirements for Yam are based on `balanceOfUnderlying`, which are YAMs without the rebasing `scalingFactor` applied. Since the rebase function has been disabled as of Dec 29 the scaling factor is currently fixed to 2.50. Your voting power is your balance of Yam tokens / 2.50.\n\nTo submit a proposal:\n\n- In snapshot a user must have 100 BoU YAMs delegated to their address.\n\n- For on-chain voting, a user must have 50,000 BoU YAMs delegated to their address This is equivalent to 1% of the initial token supply.\n\n\nBasing quorum around a minimum amount of \"For\" votes eliminates a scenario in which voting \"Against\" could actually lead a proposal to pass when abstaining would cause it to fail (for example if there were 198k \"For\" votes and zero \"Against\", a 2k \"Against would allow the proposal to pass if quorum was based on total votes rather than total \"For\" votes).\n\n## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.yam.finance/yam/governance\\#lp-governance-participation)    LP Governance Participation\n\nOnly if you provide liquidity to [Sushiswap](https://sushiswap.fi/pair/0x0f82e57804d0b1f6fab2370a43dcfad3c7cb239c) Yam/ETH pool and stake on Yam's incentivizer using [yam.finance/farm](https://yam.finance/farm). Don't forget to register to vote on [yam.finance/governance](https://yam.finance/governance), only needs to be done once. Voting power is determined by distributing the voting power of YAM held in the YAM/ETH Sushiswap pool, but distributed to only YAM Incentivizer stakers. This was done to mitigate flashloan threats in voting, so the Incentivizer contract keeps a record of the necessary values at needed block heights to facilitate those mitigations.\n\n[PreviousHistory](https://docs.yam.finance/yam/history) [NextTreasury](https://docs.yam.finance/yam/treasury)\n\nLast updated 4 years ago\n\nWas this helpful?",

Andrew B. Hall and Sho Miyazaki share an empirical political science [study of liquid democracy](https://andrewbenjaminhall.com/Hall_Miyazaki_Delegation.pdf?utm_source=drc.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=drc-december-report) in real-world settings, analyzing data from over 250,000 voters and 1,700 proposals across 18 DAOs built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn exploring cooperative paradigms for artificial intelligence, Sarah Hubbard explores [alternative ownership and governance structures for AI](https://ash.harvard.edu/resources/cooperative-paradigms-for-artificial-intelligence/?utm_source=drc.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=drc-december-report) that may better serve the public interest than current models: “_While there have been some shifts in corporate governance, there must be a greater movement toward empowering people to collectively and cooperatively govern the AI systems that are impacting their lives._”\n\n[![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/06434e11-0722-4c3b-9992-565b0d9dc345/Screenshot_2024-12-10_at_09.42.52.png?t=1733820196)](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/features/hidden-cost-ai-conversation-professor-mark-graham?utm_source=drc.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=drc-december-report)\n\n[Cooperative Paradigms for Artificial Intelligence](https://ash.harvard.edu/resources/cooperative-paradigms-for-artificial-intelligence/?utm_source=drc.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=drc-december-report)\n\nIn assessing how [Web3 can transform social impact](https://pub.superbenefit.org/reimagining-power-how-web3-can-transform-social-impact?utm_source=drc.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=drc-december-report), a team of collaborators turn their focus to philanthropy: “_In the face of multiple crises, systemic inequities, and entrenched power imbalances, philanthropy stands at a pivotal moment. Achieving transformational change requires bold shifts in how we understand and exercise power, mobilize resources, and distribute value._”\n\nAnd in their new [Blueprint to Digital Governance](https://www.projectliberty.io/news/project-liberty-unveils-blueprint-to-guide-policymakers-on-digital-governance/?utm_source=drc.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=drc-december-report), Project Liberty proposes policy for a federal right of data portability, interoperability standards, distributed systems for better data stewardship, and for greater partnership with democratic allies in renewing our commitment to a global internet.\n\n_**The Full Rundown**_\n\nOther stories and research we’re tracking for you:\n\n- Current research in “plural alignment” concentrates on making AI models amenable to diverse human values. But Christina Lu argues that plurality is not simply a safeguard against bias or an engine of efficiency: it's a [key ingredient for intelligence itself](https://www.combinationsmag.com/model-plurality/?utm_source=drc.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=drc-december-report).\n\n- David Gray Widder, Meredith Whittaker, and Sarah Myers West explain how[‘open’ AI systems are actually closed](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08141-1?utm_source=drc.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=drc-december-report): “_We find that openness alone does not perturb the concentration of power in AI. Just as many traditional open-source software projects were co-opted in various ways by large technology companies, we show how rhetoric around ‘open’ AI is frequently wielded in ways that exacerbate rather than reduce concentration of power in the AI sector._”\n\n- a16z asked 50 partners to preview [one big idea](https://a16z.com/big-ideas-in-tech-2025/?utm_source=drc.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=drc-december-report) that will spur innovation in 2025. Answers include liquid democracy and greater adoption of the ‘DUNA,’an external \"AI brain,\" big swings in biopharma, infinite games, a nuclear resurgence, \"faceless\" creators, Google search challengers, and battlefield AI.\n\n- Nathan Schneider joins Flaming Hydra to discuss his conversations and insights with [digital rights activists in India](https://flaminghydra.com/issue-208/?utm_source=drc.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=drc-december-report). “_Their concern about democracy was not its slowness or inconvenience—normally the worry among Americans—but the dangers of majoritarian rule._”\n\n- Kevin Owocki presents the [Onchain Capital Allocation Handbook](https://allobook.gitcoin.co/?utm_source=drc.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=drc-december-report), exploring how, by addressing coordination failures and introducing new onchain strategies, crypto could transform how society allocates resources.\n\n- RadicalxChange introduces their new publicaiton, [Combinationsmag](https://www.combinationsmag.com/?utm_source=drc.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=drc-december-report), exploring ideas about economics, democracy, and the relationship between technology and power.\n\n\n[![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a63063f4-f43e-4413-830c-de70d1d8f3f5/signal-2024-03-11-100120.jpeg?t=1710177688)](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/techquitable/id1730611363?utm_source=drc.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=drc-december-report)\n\nIn this episode of Techquitable, we sat down with Sheila Warren, voted one of the most influential women in DC by the Washingtonian and founder of the World Economic Forum’s blockchain and digital assets team. [Here](http://podfollow.com/1730611363?utm_source=drc.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=drc-december-report), she shares her perspective on the stalled crypto policy in America, her current work at the Crypto Council for Innovation and much more.\n\nIf you’re working on related research or would like to get involved in our work, please reach out to us via [info@thedrcenter.org](mailto:info@thedrcenter.org).

[Anchor link to header](https://drepute.github.io/playbook/index.html\\#hey-there)\n\n![](https://drepute.github.io/playbook/img/cover.png)\n\nIn our quest to help communities maximize their potential, we couldn’t help but try and understand how communities work at a deeper level.\n\n- What dynamics govern them?\n- How does an average community evolve?\n- And, most importantly, how does one start a community around an interest or a goal?\n\nTo answer these questions, we started putting together this community building playbook as a public good. And we invite you to co-create it with us!\n\nDistilling community building into a formula is futile and also not our intention here. Instead, we aim to open a two-way dialogue with the reader and discuss the general direction we should move in. As a result, this public good may seem incomplete, and it shall always be so.\n\nAs community members, we know the infinite ways in which communities rise and fall. Technological developments often disrupt established processes and ground rules and add to this complexity. As a result, the community building meta keeps changing.\n\nThe rules of building a decentralized, digital community differ from those of building an irl one. This playbook focuses on the former type of communities and highlights the concepts and practices that have worked in this domain.\n\nWe invite you to share your experiences so we may refine this playbook and make it a possible reference point for the community builders of tomorrow. 😄",

This is not a bbq, Saturday night ‘singalong around a fire with your friends’ record. This is a heavy slab. It’s a pressure that weighs upon your chest, pressing down relentlessly for the duration of this stunning release, until (of all people) Ronald Reagan’s voice appears in your ears to deliver the final killing blow. It’s also stunningly beautiful. Take your breath away beautiful… but it’s the beauty of seeing a hearse drive away with a loved one inside it, and knowing that they’ll live forever inside you, but you’ll never see them again.\n\nThis album is dripping with sadness, loss, and glorious failure. It’s an amazing release, and I’m actually a little scared to review it. I hope I do it justice. Perhaps it’s best if you imagine this review as the enthusiastic stranger at a bar after 5 pints finding out that you like the same music, and excitedly yelling at you for 20 minutes.\n\n[iframe](https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3408776844/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/)\n\n**We Lost The Sea** have been around for a while now, and this is their third album, but their first instrumental one. A band re-inventing themselves in such an ambitious fashion is always fraught with potential pitfalls, but in my opinion this is a masterstroke. A nimble dodge of the usual tropes, and a carefully thought out, intelligent and passionate release that drips catharsis, closure and amazing storytelling, without actually singing a single word. I don’t know many bands that can do that.\n\nThis album is a carefully thought out celebration of human attempts, endeavours, honour, love and loss. It’s palpable on this release, dripping out of your speakers and enticing you deeper, akin to the cave dive David Shaw embarked upon. It’s an epitaph to faceless men and women that you may not have known, but after you hear this you certainly will. I’m also going to do something a little different as Matt Harvey (@matterata), guitarist in the band has made stunning artwork for each song, which I shall present here.\n\n[![wlts a gallant gentleman](https://echoesanddust.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wlts-a-gallant-gentleman.jpg)](https://www.echoesanddust.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wlts-a-gallant-gentleman.jpg)\n\nThe album opens with ‘A Gallant Gentleman’, an ode to Captain Lawrence Oates of the Scott South Pole Expedition who sacrificed himself for the greater good in 1912. A lot of you may have heard his famous words in school, as “I am just going outside and may be some time” might be one of the most understated goodbyes of all time. Imagine huddling in a tent, blizzards howling outside, barely coherent and knowing that all your exploits failed… Only to find some inner strength and stumble off into the black night, dying cold, lonely and buried forever in a shapeless white snowdrift, the tundra claiming you as its own. For your friends. And the music matches this perfectly. Slowly chiming guitars build and swirl like the snowstorms of that night, a girls choir eerily echoing in the background doubling as the Antarctic wind until the song peaks, cymbals crashing and a trio of guitars rolling over you, the cadence fixed & forced, lurching, stumbling and inexorably marching forwards until you fall, left with nothing but the ‘wind’ swirling around you. And while this is a lonely sacrifice (and let’s face it, dying from hypothermia alone in the night is pretty lonely) somehow the music retains an uplifting quality. Out of death comes life. It’s a delicate balancing act and one that’s pulled off with aplomb.\n\n[![wlts bogatyri](https://echoesanddust.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wlts-bogatyri.jpg)](https://www.echoesanddust.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wlts-bogatyri.jpg)\n\n‘Bogatyri’ is next, recounting the sacrifice of Valeri Bezpalov, Alexie Ananenko & Boris Baranov at the Chernobyl disaster. Three brave men who selflessly sacrificed themselves to open a valve in heavily irradiated water to save countless lives, then buried in lead coffins ten days later. One can only imagine what they must have felt, their bodies breaking down cell by cell, day by day. A selfless act that consigns them to the annals of history, leaving wives without husbands and children without fathers. Not a failure per se as their actions saved many, but a noble sacrifice. An act resulting in certain death. I’d had the privilege of seeing this live the week before as the band supported **This Will Destroy You**, and was suckered hard by this rollicking, bleak and heavy track. The Twin Peaks inspired bassline and cymbal work that kicks in around the two minute mark is sublime, all smoky nightclub and grizzled chanteuse leaning into a microphone to warn her listeners of the impending doom… Until the guitars gradually take over, leading you on for a minute or so as the crescendo builds and builds. And then – bang. There’s a time change and you’re pulled into the dark, irradiated water along with the Bogatyri (a Ukrainian folklore tale of three valiant knights). Constrained and dark, choking you slowly as the guitars peak again and again, washing over you as the bass rumbles and jars, the cymbals swirling around your head. It swirls for ages, drowning you in sound and an absence of light, just as our three brave men would have experienced. This is 12 minutes of your life that passes all too quickly, until all you’re left with are the decaying guitars, symbolic of their frail bodies at the end.\n\n[![wlts the last dive of david shaw](https://echoesanddust.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wlts-the-last-dive-of-david-shaw.jpg)](https://www.echoesanddust.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wlts-the-last-dive-of-david-shaw.jpg)\n\nI confess, before this release I had never heard of David Shaw. Now, I’ll always know him. Before you read further I strongly suggest you watch this video, which is the actual last dive in question:\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/mF4iFJ-G74o?feature=oembed)\n\nUnsurprisingly given the tone of this album, this is heavy stuff. You’re watching a man die right in front of your eyes. Attempting to do something selfless, brave & noble – and failing. At 271 metres underwater. I don’t dive but that is an insane depth to dive to – the human body is just not designed for it. And 5 minutes at that depth equals over 12 hours coming back up to avoid nitrogen narcosis. Again, there really aren’t enough words to describe how full on this is. But there is this music.\n\nCloying, claustrophobic and doomed, this track lurches deeper and deeper, beginning with the audio of Dave’s last dive. The water rushes over you and you start to sink as a distorted wall of feedback wraps its fingers around you until you push through to the clean, sterile guitar tones. These build musically (but not sonically) as Dave’s audio fades out, leaving you with the track. You sink deeper, drums matching the beating of your heart as you pass fifty, then 100 metres. And then time slows. The music stops. All is quiet, tranquil and serene. Then a country inspired guitar twang cuts through, wrapping around your torso and pulling you down into the depths. Like Dave, you go willingly. Unlike Dave, you’re coming back. The guitar and cello parts start to entwine, the drums mashing into your head along with the bass as you feel the floor of the cave under your feet. Then things explode, lurching around your head as the guitars wail, their cacophony building over minutes, not seconds, leaving you in a trance until twelve minutes in everything comes together in a glorious dark, sinful melody that for me is a fitting soundtrack to Dave’s last dive. Musically this is the equivalent of nitrogen narcosis, leaving you ‘drunk’ and unsure of what’s just happened. All you know is that it’s cold, dark and deep.\n\nIt’s deep, you’re alone and playing with a body that’s been there for ten years. And soon you’ll be joining him. And yet in this darkness and death there is still a sliver of light, as David Shaw kept his promise to Deon Dryer’s parents. He brought him back. Four days later Dave and Deon’s bodies were pulled to the surface. A promise kept – at the highest cost of all.\n\n[![wlts challenger pt 1](https://echoesanddust.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wlts-challenger-pt-1.jpg)](https://www.echoesanddust.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wlts-challenger-pt-1.jpg)\n\nIt’s a fairly safe bet that most of the Western world is aware of the Challenger disaster – we either experienced it live or have seen the footage numerous times since that fateful day in 1986. Possibly the most dramatic failure of the American space program, it hammered home to a new generation the dangers, pitfalls and sheer science & skill involved in getting our feeble bodies to break free of the bonds of our atmosphere and up into the unknown. But on January 28th of that year it was not to be, a nailbiting 73 seconds permanently etched into the collective consciousness. I don’t know if it’s deliberate or not, but the intro riff of this track is close enough to 73 seconds that watching video of the launch while listening to this is an eerie experience. That is, after we have a beautiful speech by William S. Burroughs on Dreams from 1980. “We’re not there yet” indeed.\n\nThe lonely, melancholic guitar starts things off after the spoken word/ambient intro, all empty sadness, sorrow and reflection on things that could have been, yet weren’t. It’s poignant and deep, circuiting the edge of trancelike structure while everything slowly builds around you, a harsh guitar melody climbing out of the fog. A driving beat kicks in around the nine minute mark, bleak, and lacking hope. And this is yet another section where having three guitarists pays off in dividends, as it allows space to build and expand upon a riff, droning and weaving around the anchoring of the bass & drums… But only briefly. All too soon we’re taken into space (an overarching theme on this album, but this time literal), back with the fated crew as a lone guitar line soars through everything, cutting you with its distortion. It’s all melancholic country twang here, reminding me of lonely journeys through dust caked back roads. And then a moog-esque keyboard melody kicks in and tension is immediately there around you. And with a sample from the Challenger launch we’re there in the climax of the song, 19 minutes in. It’s glorious. Special. Every band member beating the living shit out of their instruments, wringing every last bent, distorted note out of them that they can. Not just playing the music, but being consumed by it.\n\nAnd then all too soon, it’s gone. Over. And we’re left with samples of the crowd from January 28th. And with a thick ‘Jersey’ accent we have a devastated woman sum up this album better than I ever could, with the quote that opens this review. It’s powerful, poignant and a little bit soul destroying.\n\n[![wlts challenger pt 2](https://echoesanddust.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wlts-challenger-pt-2.jpg)](https://www.echoesanddust.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wlts-challenger-pt-2.jpg)\n\nAnd then we’re into the home stretch. The ‘swan song’ indeed. And yet this track, while similar to the rest of the album differs somewhat. It allows a sliver of light in. It’s not happy or joyous in the beginning, but affirming. Guitars providing a chiming release as soft cymbal work and (I’m assuming) mallet-hit floor toms gently push you forwards towards the edge of the cliff. You’ve come this far – there’s no point going back now. And then we’re falling, wrapped in that blanket of quiet despair that has been prevalent throughout. But if ever there was a slow fall, this is it. You have time to examine your surroundings as the band slowly build the track, layer after layer, until what is possibly the only major chord on the album explodes and before you hit the ground you’re caught. And brought up. It’s an affirmation of all the heavy shit that’s come before, and a promise that there is light to come. As Dylan Thomas said: “Do not go gentle into that good night”, and this battle helps confirm that.\n\nIs it telling that they chose not to include the line “our hopes and our journeys continue” from Reagan’s closing speech? I like to think so. I like to think that it’s superfluous, as this beautiful music tells you that. This is the hand on your shoulder from a loved one while you’re at your lowest ebb, the smile of a friend as you bare your soul. There’s no judgement here. Just beautiful, special music.\n\nSo here we are. This isn’t just an album – it’s a baring of humanity’s soul. It’s a realisation that you can fuck up, fail and fall and not only have people done it before, but there will be someone, anyone there for you. As a band they’ve managed to write songs that match the tone and feel of each story that they’re telling, along with stunning artwork to go with it.\n\nThis is a special, unique release. This is a band going through dark days and coming out the other side, by embracing it and inviting us to share this with them. This is not something that comes along every day, and I thank them for it. If you ever have a discussion with someone and want to prove the power of music – reach for this.\n\nNow if you don’t mind me, I’m going to go and listen to it again.

The data sets on sale contain crucial information such as Aadhaar and passport details, along with names, phone numbers, and addresses, according to the report.\n\nThe details were a part of the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) database.\n\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is expected to probe the incident after the ICMR files a complaint.\n\nThe [data breach](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/data-breach) noticed by Resecurity mentioned that \"on October 9, a threat actor going by the alias 'pwn0001' posted a thread on Breach Forums brokering access to 815 million 'Indian Citizen Aadhaar and Passport' records\".\n\nMoreover, the cybersecurity analysts found one of the leaked samples containing 100,000 records of [PII](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/pii) (personally identifiable information) related to Indian residents.\n\nIn this sample leak, the analysts identified valid [Aadhaar Card](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/aadhaar-card) IDs, which were corroborated via a government portal that provides a \" [Verify Aadhaar](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/verify-aadhaar)\" feature.\n\nThe analysts also managed to connect with the threat actor and learned they were willing to sell the entire Aadhaar and Indian passport dataset for $80,000 (over Rs 66 lakh).\n\nHowever, the threat actor declined to specify how they obtained the data.\n\nLast month, cybersecurity researchers found that the official website of the Ministry of AYUSH in Jharkhand had been breached, exposing over 3.2 lakh patient records on the dark web.\n\nAccording to the cybersecurity company CloudSEK, the website's database, amounting to 7.3 MB, holds patient records that include PII and medical diagnoses. The compromised data also contains sensitive information about doctors, including their PII, login credentials, usernames, passwords, and phone numbers.\n\nThe data breach was initiated by a threat actor named \" [Tanaka](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/tanaka)\".\n\n_(With input from agencies)_\n\nAdd![ET Logo](https://img.etimg.com/photo/123467569.cms)as a Reliable and Trusted News Source\n\n[![Google Preference in ET](https://img.etimg.com/photo/123467572.cms)Add Now!](https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=economictimes \"Google Preference in ET\")\n\n### Read more news on\n\n[data breach](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/data-breach) [cybersecurity](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/cybersecurity) [aadhaar card](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/aadhaar-card) [tanaka](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/tanaka) [pii](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/pii) [verify aadhaar](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/verify-aadhaar)\n\n(Catch all the [Budget 2024 News](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/budget), Events and [Latest News](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/latest-news) Updates on [The Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/).)\n\n...more\n\nAdd Comment\n\nElevate your knowledge and leadership skills at a cost cheaper than your daily tea.\n\n- ![Image for Profits without value?

We were too! So we decided to try to compile some of the most interesting articles, learn the difference between a DAO and an NFT, and try to be a helpful guide to what could turn out to be the biggest technology innovation in decades … or, in the wrong hands, a pyramid scheme that would make Bernie Madoff blush.\n\nThis is a pretty long article, but that’s because the topic itself is so meaty, and because we’ve decided to try to make it accessible to those who truly know almost nothing about Web3. In the next post, we’ll actually discuss the education applications.\n\n# Primary Resources\n\nBecause there are so many articles about Web3, and Web3 in the context of education, we decided that rather than a long series of links, we would use an innovative new curation tool, [Readocracy](https://readocracy.com/), to create some ‘reading lists’ of all the research we did for this article.\n\n- We are also indebted to Bhaumik Patel and his work with the amazing [Crypto, Culture and Society](https://g.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x819b12E7b398021fbD9D2acdC8B7349E3D732B51) education DAO for curating this terrific [Web3 Starter Pack](https://cryptosociety.notion.site/WEB3-STARTER-PACK-5a922714348e4a7cbaa45b2f0a8861bd). What’s an education DAO, you ask? Read on and find out!\n\n\n- Here’s our [Web3 and Education Reading List](https://readocracy.com/collections/crypto-articles) \\- 24 articles and counting…\n\n- [Readocracy’s “Hype Free” Web3 Reading List](https://readocracy.com/collections/hype-free-web3)\n\n- Notion-based [Crypto Fundamentals eBook](https://withsmoothie.notion.site/Crypto-Fundamentals-2019149cb4de4c4695f5a0cd26c4e986)\n\n\n# Web3 Terminology\n\nWeb3 terminology can be a beast- an unholy combination of different specialized vocabularies- technology, accounting, economics, law, government and finance, with lots of acronyms. While a few terms are relatively self-explanatory, like ‘digital wallet’ (where you store your digital currency), most others are quite opaque.\n\nWe know that there are approximately a gazillion other such articles and videos on the internet already for crypto beginners, but for us, too many of them are off-putting. They are either written by true believers to evangelize and recruit new Web3 acolytes, by skeptics who spend the whole time telling you why Web3 is a sham without defining it, or by insiders who use the complex technical and economic jargon that alienates true beginners.\n\nThis last issue is a classic example of one of our favorite concepts in instructional design: [“The Expert Blind Spot](https://medium.com/educate-pub/beware-the-expert-blind-spot-42744dc66ba9),” in which experts end up talking right over the heads of beginners by making large mental leaps without explaining them. We’re newcomers to Web3 ourselves, so we do our best to avoid that here.\n\nSo, in alignment with one of our _other_ favorite instructional design concepts, the **[pretraining principle](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/multimedia-learning/pretraining-principle/01791D57F5D4164251269E6DF56A8BF1)**, which recommends explicitly front loading core concepts and vocabulary to ensure no one gets lost in the details later, let’s do a quick crash course in some of the most common and important concepts and terms in Web3.\n\nIf you’re already knowledgeable about Web3 vocab, you may want to skip this post and stay tuned for the next one. If not, hope this helps!\n\n### **What is Web3?**\n\n> In the software world, when a new version of a program or operating system is released, it gets a version number. A small update to software is called a “ [point release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_release)” (such as going from Version 1 to Version 1.1), while a major update gets a fully new number (going from Version 1.0 to Version 2.0).\n>\n> The term Web3 really means “Web Version 3.0”, which implies a vision for a _fully new version of the internet_; the term was [coined by Gavin Wood](https://www.wired.com/story/web3-gavin-wood-interview/) in 2014, but has caught fire in the last year.\n>\n> So, in this mental model, what are Web1 (AKA Web Version 1.0) and Web2 (AKA Web Version 2.0), you ask? Great question!\n\n### **What is Web 1.0?**\n\n> Web 1.0 refers to the ‘read-only’ internet of the 1990s, when sites like AOL or Yahoo! News would ‘publish’ information designed to be consumed by others. Of course, the internet was never _truly_ read-only, but this refers to the era of the internet where one needed to be able to develop a website from scratch to put anything online.\n\n### **What is Web 2.0?**\n\n> Web 2.0 refers to the ‘platform’ era of the internet (the one most of us are still living in) in which many of the most popular internet properties offer anyone the ability to create and publish content.\n>\n> Modern social media sites like Tiktok, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Linkedin or Instagram, and old-school social media and web building sites like Friendster, Myspace or Geocities are all, at heart, just publishing platforms.\n>\n> Marketplaces like Airbnb, Etsy, and Ebay, or open-access educational sites like Udemy, Skillshare and Teachable, are also platforms, and as such, are totally reliant on user contributions.\n>\n> In the **Web3** philosophy, when a user like you or me adds content or data to a Web2 platform, the platform then, for all intents and purposes, ‘owns’ that content. The platform can save your content to their servers, often permanently. They can censor and remove your content if it violates their ever-changing terms of service. Then can and do bake your content into their search and discovery algorithms and promote or bury it.\n>\n> And most importantly, these platforms _**profit**_ off of user content, either by:\n\n- Taking a cut of online sales\n\n  - Like Apple’s App store, Google Play, Amazon, Airbnb, Etsy, Ebay, Udemy\n- Selling the eyeballs and data of people watching content to third parties for advertising purposes\n\n  - Like Facebook, Instagram, Google/Youtube, Reddit, Vimeo, news sites\n- Offering in-app purchases to users to enhance their abilities\n\n  - Like dating sites like Hinge or Tiktok, which generates $110m a _month_ by selling coins that users can give to others\n- Charging a subscription fee to access certain tiers of content\n\n  - Like Linkedin’s recruiter tool, Medium, and online dating sites like Match or eHarmony\n\n> In the Web3 philosophy, platform companies take ownership over, and get astoundingly rich off of, our user-generated content. Which isn’t really fair, is it?\n\n### **OK… so what is Web3 again?**\n\n> Web3 refers to the vision of a ‘read-write-own’ era of the internet, in which users maintain full ownership over their content and data outside of their reliance on platforms and can contribute to decision making.\n>\n> Besides ‘decentralized,’ Web3 advocates use terms like ‘permissionless’, ‘transparent’, ‘trustless’, ‘frictionless’, and ‘censorship-free’ to describe their vision of the new internet. One interesting aspect of the Web3 population is that it includes people from very different political philosophies, from libertarians who believe want to do away with central oversight, including taxes or regulation, to socialists who love the idea of communal governance and shared ownership.\n\n#### _The current Web3 community includes both economic libertarians and idealistic socialists; it can feel a bit like “Wall Street” meets “Occupy Wall Street.”_\n\n> The Web3 vision is almost always associated with the creation of blockchain technology, which allows any piece of content or data to be inextricably linked to its current owner. In the Web3 vision, an influencer or artist (or educator) can make content, own it outright, and sell or rent it to others directly, without giving any cut to any platform.\n>\n> For a popular example of how this plays out in practice, consider the 2021 story of the [Disaster Girl meme](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/arts/disaster-girl-meme-nft.html), which you may have seen bouncing around last year.\n>\n> In 2005, David Roth took a photo of his daughter Zoë Roth in front of a controlled burn. It looked like this:\n>\n> [![](https://edtechinsiders.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa28438a2-3f14-4281-97cd-5cf499e2db02_300x168.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sBB7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa28438a2-3f14-4281-97cd-5cf499e2db02_300x168.png)\n>\n> When the Roths uploaded the picture online, it hit a nerve as a visual signifier of ‘revenge’ (or at least, ‘schadenfreude’). In 2007, the photo began being turned into a [wildly popular meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/disaster-girl), which meant that people would make copies of the photo, add their own text to it, and then republish it online. An example of some of the memes:\n>\n> [![](https://edtechinsiders.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1660ae1d-c8e2-432d-8126-8ce2e8805517_1088x302.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kzUA!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1660ae1d-c8e2-432d-8126-8ce2e8805517_1088x302.png)\n>\n> In the Web2 world, meme-friendly platforms like Reddit or 4Chan were profiting by selling ads against all the user-generated “Disaster Girl” memes, while David and Zoë Roth had no way to profit off of the repurposing and mass distribution of their own content.\n>\n> Web3 ethos, David and Zoë Roth should really ‘own’ that content, which would mean putting the photo into a transparent, verified digital contract that proved her ownership and paid her royalties for its use. She did just this in April 2021 by turning the photo into a digital asset, which she sold for 180 Ether (a digital currency worth between $400,000 and $500,000.)\n>\n> [![](https://edtechinsiders.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79f2a072-a141-4b54-a650-f157743f0367_946x284.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aJEK!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79f2a072-a141-4b54-a650-f157743f0367_946x284.png)\n\n**What is a Blockchain?**\n\n> The official definition of a blockchain is a “system in which a record of transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network.”\n>\n> Let’s break it down:\n\n1. **‘Record of transactions…’:** This means a series of receipts showing money going back and forth, which is known in economics as a ‘ledger’. If you’ve ever run a business, or balanced a checkbook, or even looked at your own bank statement, you’ve dealt with a ledger.\n\n2. **‘Made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency…’:** This means that the transactions are made using _digital_ currency, rather than actual dollars, euros, pesos or yen (which are what economists and Web3 folks call ‘ [fiat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp)’).\n\n3. **‘Maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network’.** This means that the information in the ledger is _distributed_, and every computer in the network has a copy.\n\n\n> A single transaction is a ‘block’ and the series of transactions is a chain. Thus: blockchain. And if you hear Blockchain/Web3 folks talk about the ‘distributed ledger’, this is all they really mean; a record of transactions that _everyone_ has an up-to-date copy of.\n\n[![](https://edtechinsiders.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe90876b9-927e-428b-bc39-ba36cebb7106_1200x789.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tRpi!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe90876b9-927e-428b-bc39-ba36cebb7106_1200x789.png) **[Image Source](https://medium.com/@yazannajjar44/what-is-blockchain-how-dose-blockchain-work-4ee99c0d4e9b)**\n\n> If it’s that simple, why is this considered a world-changing technology?\n>\n> Short answer; because there is no _central_ authority. There is no bank, or loan provider, or credit card company, that has to ‘approve’ any given transaction; instead, each transaction is approved, or declined, entirely by the network itself, which is composed of computers, not people.\n>\n> It’s important to note that there is more than one blockchain; any group can make one and build off of it. There is the original blockchain on which Bitcoin was launched, but there is also an Ethereum blockchain, a Solana Blockchain, a Parity Blockchain, and many more.\n>\n> It also must be stated here that while Web3 and Blockchain technology are usually mentioned in the same breath, _**many of the core philosophical ideas behind Web3 can exist outside of a Blockchain.**_ The ideas that individuals should own their own data, that transactions should be transparent and decentralized outside of platforms, and that decisions can be made by consensus, have been advocated by tech luminaries like [Tim Berners-Lee](https://solidproject.org/team) and [Jaron Lanier](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/23/opinion/data-privacy-jaron-lanier.html) and tried in various non-Blockchain contexts.\n\n**What is Decentralization?**\n\n> Decentralization is the main philosophical tenet of Web3: it’s the idea that many essential aspects of our lives are ‘centralized,’ meaning they are run by intermediaries who control our money, data, and political representation, among other aspects of our lives.\n>\n> Banks are a “centralized” finance system- they can make money off of your deposits, or shut your accounts down, or charge you fees as they please. Social media platforms are ‘centralized’; they can use your data and behavior to sell targeted ads or kick you out if you violate their rules.  Governments are ‘centralized’, in that you have to express your political views through a representative rather than getting to vote directly on each issue, and apply to them to get permits and licenses.\n>\n> In contrast, in a decentralized world, these entities would be disintermediated and individuals could interact directly. For example, you can transfer money with needing to write a bank-issued check or charge a company-owned card.\n\n**What is a DAO?**\n\n> DAO stands for “Decentralized Autonomous Organization”, which is the expression of Web3 advocates’ desire for a decentralized system that places more power into the hands of the community. DAOs are community-led with no central authority; they rely on all members of that community to vote on critical decisions about the future of the DAO. These rules are then encoded, making them trackable and transparent to all members (and potentially other external players ie. auditing bodies). The community sets the rules for how members will join the DAO. There are DAOs where you can participate without purchasing its cryptocurrency and DAOs where you can only join if you first buy a coin.\n\n**What is a Token?**\n\n> In the Crypto/Web3 finance world, a token represents anything you can own, buy or sell: what the accounting and finance worlds call an “asset”. Tokens are one of the core innovations of the Ethereum blockchain, which allows there to be an infinite number of different tokens ‘minted’ that make use of the Ethereum blockchain. There are hundreds of tokens that run on the Ethereum Blockchain. ( [source](https://etorox.com/news/opinions/top-5-blockchain-in-the-cryptocurrency-world/))\n>\n> Many of these tokens are created as digital currencies; while they have no physical representation in real life, they are often visually represented by a standard symbol, and a three letter watchword to represent which type of token they are.\n>\n> Other tokens are individual collectible items which have singular value- they are ‘non-fungible’ tokens, or NFTs.\n>\n> Tokens are linked to an existing Blockchain through a piece of code called a “smart contract”, which dictates how the token works.\n>\n> Just as you would say that $100 is worth €88, you can also say that 100 ETH is worth 7 BTC, which means that 100 Ether is equivalent in value to 7 Bitcoins.

For example, Ether is the native coin that runs on the Ethereum blockchain, and Bitcoin has its own blockchain as well.\n>\n> [![](https://edtechinsiders.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F262aaa9e-0b51-4515-b429-aa717c9cf9bf_792x214.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mgfk!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F262aaa9e-0b51-4515-b429-aa717c9cf9bf_792x214.png) Examples of ‘native’ coins to various blockchains, from L-R (Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Polkadot)\n\n**What is an NFT?**\n\n> NFT is an acronym of “Non-Fungible Token”.\n>\n> In legalese, ‘fungible’ means able “to replace or be replaced by another identical item; mutually interchangeable”. An example of fungibility; if a stranger at a vending machine asked you to exchange his wrinkled dollar bill for your crisp one, it’s a reasonable request; every dollar bill has the same value, and can be replaced by any other dollar bill. The same is true of most coins and tokens in Web3.\n>\n> However, if the same stranger then asked to exchange his daughter’s first baby tooth for your daughter’s first baby tooth, that’s a very different (and frankly, weird) offer. That’s because your daughter’s first baby tooth is completely unique and one-of-a-kind, and has nothing in common with the stranger’s.\n>\n> As unique items, NFTs have a specific type of value due to their scarcity. In the case of the baby tooth, it’s mostly sentimental value. However, non-fungible assets can have enormous value- because they’re irreplaceable and unique, they can carry whatever value people attribute to them, particularly when they’re items of historical or artistic significance; consider an original Basquiat painting, or the ruby slippers from _The Wizard of Oz_, or a hand-written letter by Abraham Lincoln. At the end of the day, an NFT is basically a ‘unique asset’.\n\n**What is a Smart Contract?**\n\n> Web3 enthusiasts tend to gush over this concept, as it has single-handedly enabled the creation of a huge decentralized finance ecosystem (known as Defi).\n>\n> When you enter into a legal ‘contract’ (or sign one), you’re committing to a particular set of rules and laws- if you don’t show up for work, they have a right to discipline and/or fire you. If you buy a house, you and the seller enter into a contract together with provisions that you will both follow. But, notably, if one party doesn’t fulfill their obligations, someone will have to ‘enforce’ the contract, which is why there is a whole field of Contract Law.\n>\n> What makes a smart contract “smart” is that it is _self-enforcing_; a set of rules and laws written in computer code that will automatically execute itself without the need for any lawyers or enforcers.\n>\n> For example, let’s say Alice lends Bob 3 ETH (that’s the native coin Ether, remember?) using a smart contract that stipulates that Bob will pay back the loan, with interest, in a year. If Bob doesn’t pony up, the contract itself will pull the coin out of Bob’s wallet and return it to Alicem, with no intermediaries of any kind needed.\n>\n> That’s not all. In essence, Smart Contracts, written in the Ethereum created coding language Solidity, are a toolbox that enables a whole ‘operating system’ to be built on the Ethereum Blockchain.\n>\n> For example, as we’ve seen, the whole concept of ‘tokens’ (tradable assets) is enabled by Smart Contracts, as well as the development of specialized programs known as decentralized applications, or [dApps](https://ethereum.org/en/dapps/).\n\n**What is a Web3 Protocol?**\n\n> You might already be familiar with the term protocol; its application is not unique to web3. Protocols are basically just rules to verify that data being shared is legit. In Crypto, there are many different types of protocols; They are primarily used to track every bitcoin transaction and then verify it. This is done automatically (what is called “self-verifying”) and is accomplished by lots of computers running the same protocol through a network. Protocols are a common language that enables the exchange of digital currency; without them, it would be impossible to verify the original source and validity of the digital currency.\n\n**What is Mining?**\n\n> Mining is the process used to validate a block of transactions using high-powered computers. Now, what does that actually mean?\n>\n> Let’s back up… so remember how all the data and movement of transactions in cryptocurrencies are tracked and recorded? They’re also _encrypted_ to protect that currency and make sure that it’s not subject to cybercrime. To protect it, it’s encoded with a complex set of mathematical equations, and to be able to validate the transaction, those equations need to be solved using high-powered computers. That process is known as **mining**.\n>\n> The abiding metaphor here is that, just as human miners go down to extract material from beneath the earth, computers are ‘put to work’ doing what computers do best- solving computations- and as a reward for that computational work, they are rewarded through the creation of new cryptocurrency. Computers are also put to work validating existing transactions.\n>\n> This is one of the main reasons why Web3 has had problematic climate issues; the energy required for all those computers to do all that computation is vast.\n>\n> **Note:** Not all cryptocurrencies require mining. Because of the environmental impact of running high-powered computers in large networks some cryptocurrencies have evolved their model and there is also a suite of options that are non-mined and therefore more environmentally friendly.\n\n**What is the Metaverse?**\n\n> The Metaverse is a vision of a new immersive version of the internet. In the same way that technology permeates much of our lives today, the idea behind the Metaverse is that individuals will live lives inside of the Metaverse through embodied avatars.\n>\n> One core concept to the Metaverse, compared to other ‘virtual worlds’, is that it will be entirely _integrated_, just like the current internet. The same way every website lives on the same Internet (with the exception of nutty things like the dark web), the idea is that all the parts of the Metaverse will also be integrated; the same Metaverse will be used for education, socialization, entertainment, retail, government, work, and so on.\n>\n> This concept of a persistent, embodied virtual world has been around for decades in:\n\n- Sci-fi literature such as William Gibson’s _Neuromancer_ (1984) and _Mona Lisa Overdrive_(1988), Neal Stephenson’s _Snow Crash_ (1992), _Sword Art Online_(2009) and _Ready Player One_(2011).\n\n- Movies such as _Tron_ (1982), _The Matrix_ (1999), _Avatar_ (2009) and _Ready Player One_ (2018) and [more](https://medium.com/building-the-metaverse/movies-about-the-metaverse-a0797323e7f6).\n\n- Open world social games and worlds populated by avatars representing real people like _Animal Crossing_ (2001), _[Second Life](https://spectrum.ieee.org/metaverse-second-life)_(2003) _, World of Warcraft_(2004) _, Final Fantasy XIV_(2013), _Fortnite_ (2017) and countless others.\n\n\n[![](https://edtechinsiders.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d6c132b-4612-4f20-861a-aaa4b95f8926_1160x286.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h08m!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d6c132b-4612-4f20-861a-aaa4b95f8926_1160x286.png) Linden Labs’ Second Life is an early vision of a immersive Metaverse in which people use embodied avatars to learn, socialize, shop and more.\n\n> The difference between individual games and the future vision is that _**the Metaverse**_ aspires to be the single virtual world that connects all other virtual worlds, much as the internet is the single entity that connects all other sites and platforms.\n>\n> This might sound a little dystopian, but in fact many aspects of the Metaverse already exist; anyone who has tried on a [Oculus head set,](https://www.oculus.com/) played a video game that uses [VR technology](https://www.oculus.com/blog/what-is-virtual-reality-all-about/), or tried [Ikea’s AR application](https://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/ikea-launches-augmented-reality-application) that allows you to try out furniture in your space has already experienced elements of the Metaverse.\n>\n> A nice definition of the Metaverse from [Matthew Ball](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/forwardtothemetaverseprimer), via [Brooks Cavenesi](https://www.td.org/atd-blog/what-is-the-metaverse-where-we-are-and-where-were-headed):\n>\n> _The metaverse is a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence, and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications, and payments._\n\n**Wait, what does the Metaverse have to do with Web3?**\n\n> Great question! Depends on who you ask.\n>\n> It we take Web3 as a stand-in term for ‘the next version of the internet’, you can imagine how both an ‘embodied’ internet in which we are all avatars and a ‘read-write-own’ internet in which we don’t rely on central platforms, could be either parallel or intersecting visions of the future.\n>\n> There are some projects that explicitly combine the two visions, such as [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), \"a fully decentralized virtual world that doesn’t have any central leadership, based on the Ethereum blockchain.”\n>\n> That said, the original coinage of the phrase “Web3” referred to the ‘decentralized’ version, and most other terms here will use that as the core reference, whereas the “Metaverse” concept, most recently popularized by Facebook’s major pivot to being “Meta”, is much more recent.\n\nHere are a few more quickie terms you might see with brief definitions, but we’re going to hope that you feel ‘pre-trained’.\n\n- [Proof of Work and Proof of Stake](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp#:~:text=What%20Is%20Proof%2Dof%2DStake%20vs.,new%20blocks%20to%20the%20blockchain.) are two different models of mining and finding “consensus”, meaning they are rules that tell all the different computers how to agree or disagree when verifying new transactions on a blockchain.\n\n- [ERC-20](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-erc20-and-what-does-it-mean-ethereum/) is a template token that contains rules used to create other Ethereum tokens.\n\n- [Gas Fees](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp)\\- the price you pay to execute a contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

As I drove towards this swirling ecological marvel, I was miraculously positioned right underneath it by a stoplight. As I waited, the birds circled directly overhead as I strained to watch them through my side, front, roof — side, front, roof windows.\n\nAnd I knew I had to write my first post of the year on emergence. Today we cover:\n\n1. _Starlings, ant colonies, and consciousness_\n2. _Complexity economics_\n3. _Mimetic desire_\n\nThis means, I’m interrupting the [Profit](https://embodied-economics.ghost.io/probing-our-profit-paradigms-part-1/) series for a moment. I gave myself the present of permission this year — and, in part, that means permission to write about the things I’m most excited about. So who knows when Profit will resume…but I'm sure its time will come.\n\nOh, and if a friend forwarded you this post, you can [subscribe here](https://embodied-economics.ghost.io/).\n\n* * *\n\n> “Complexity economics sees the economy not as mechanistic, static, timeless and perfect but as organic, always creating itself, alive and full of messy vitality.”\n>\n> — W. Brian Arthur\n\n### Starlings, ant colonies, and consciousness\n\nStarlings are birds found in nearly all regions of the world (though are considered an invasive species in North America). They form wild, undulating shapes called murmurations which are a form of swarm behavior — a complex collective behavior arising from individual actions. Complex collective action without centralized control is also seen in ant and honeybee colonies. And these forms of animal behavior all share something in common: they exhibit properties of **emergence**.\n\n![](https://media.tenor.com/images/24673335000920813fb80bd882000095/tenor.gif)\n\nEmergence, a term from complexity science, is all around us. Bodies, families, democracy, markets, forests, and many other phenomena display emergent properties — they exhibit properties unique in combination that their individual component elements don’t have in isolation.\n\nHuman consciousness is another example. Consciousness is not simply the sum of the physical component parts of the brain: neurons, synapses, brain stem, etc. If you threw all those things together in a corner, you wouldn’t expect consciousness to arise. Consciousness only arises from the combinations and synergies of its component parts which form layers of new structures which re-combine to scaffold new combinations, and so on. These combinations of combinations ultimately emerge an entirely unexpected and non-mathematically calculable outcome: consciousness.\n\n![](https://embodied-economics.ghost.io/content/images/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-19-at-6.45.21-PM.png)An oversimplified graphic I made...\n\nEmergent phenomena are non-linear, self-organizing, and they evolve in an open-ended way (meaning, we cannot predict what will emerge from the component parts). Physicists trying to understand how life forms describe life this way, saying things like “biology is the next frontier of physics.” I (and many others) would argue it is the next frontier of economics, as well.\n\nWithout getting too technical in this post, there is both ‘strong’ emergence and ‘weak’ emergence. Flocking starlings are an example of weak emergence in that we have actually figured out the mathematical rules which govern this behavior: 1. The birds align their movement with the 6-7 birds surrounding them 2. They keep enough distance to not crash into each other and 3. They remain close to their neighbors (presumably to align their flight pattern with neighboring birds).\n\nTo truly understand the behavior of swarms, we could not simply analyze the individual behavior of one bird. Neither could we add up the motion of each individual bird to understand the flock in aggregate. Instead, we would need to look at both the individual birds, how they interact with each other, the patterns they form, the final outcome of murmuration, and how that feeds back to each individual bird's behavior. This is how we can begin to understand emergence.\n\n### Complexity economics\n\nSimilarly in economics, we cannot understand the economy by only analyzing the behavior of individuals (as behavioral economics has emphasized) or by adding up its component parts in aggregates (like GDP or other Keynesian methods). We need to understand the economy as a complex, emergent system which is constantly shifting – like a murmuration.\n\nWe are taught that markets can reach a state of natural equilibrium – supply and demand. But this kind of general equilibrium does not exist in emergent systems.\n\n![](https://embodied-economics.ghost.io/content/images/2022/01/image-1.png)\n\nAnd this is one of the biggest disconnects in how we understand the economy today. Many economists still function in a world of reductionist cause and effect, and linear models or measurement tools. For example, \"if we pump money into the economy by central banks, it will cause inflation.\" In other words: If we do X, we get Y. To be fair, many economists don’t think the world actually functions this way, they use reductionism because it simplifies analysis and helps with mathematical calculations.\n\nBut the reason this rarely works, is because economic systems are emergent — it's difficult to take an action which yields a linear outcome of our choosing. **There is no central command center for the economy – we all create it together, as it creates us, in an emergent loop.** And as of now, we don’t have sophisticated enough tools, or computational power, to measure and model this across the entire economy. We can only begin to understand it via triangulation.\n\nHowever, an increasing number of heterodox (unorthodox) economists are trying to do just this in a field now known as complexity economics. A pioneer of complexity science and recipient of the Schumpeter Prize in economics — **[W. Brian Arthur](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/w-brian-arthur?ref=embodied-economics.ghost.io)**— said this in a recent [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-020-00273-3?ref=embodied-economics.ghost.io):\n\n> “ _Complexity economics sees the economy — or the parts of it that interest us — as not necessarily in equilibrium, its decision makers (or agents) as not super-rational, the problems they face as not necessarily well-defined and the economy not as a perfectly humming machine but as an ever-changing ecology of beliefs, organizing principles and behaviours. The approach, which has now spread throughout the economics profession, got its start largely at the Santa Fe Institute (SFI) in the late 1980s. But the basic ideas of complexity economics have an even longer history in economics. Even before Adam Smith, economists noted that aggregate outcomes in the economy, such as patterns of trade, market prices and quantities of goods produced and consumed, form from individual behaviour, and individual behaviour, in turn, reacts to these aggregate outcomes. There is a recursive loop. It is this recursive loop that makes the economy a complex system.”_\n\nDemocracy is another helpful example – we elect leaders, create laws and structures which govern our behaviour (we exert upward causation on the system), and those laws and structures govern our behavior (there is downward causation from the system to our actions). Similarly with the global economy — we create agreements about money and value, create institutions to exchange, govern, and facilitate the flow of that 'value,' and what emerges is a hyper-networked and complex global economy. That economy then influences our behavior.\n\n![](https://embodied-economics.ghost.io/content/images/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-21-at-11.21.08-AM.png)Another graphic I made...\n\n### Mimetic desire\n\n**Emergence teaches us that we create patterns which in turn create, and pattern, us.** And this applies to much of how our paradigms scaffold our systems of behavior.\n\nHow do we know what we want in life? The French philosopher René Girard said that we learn what we desire by imitating others: “Man is the creature who does not know what to desire, and he turns to others in order to make up his mind. We desire what others desire because we imitate their desires.” (h/t to my friend Stacey Fikes for reminding me of Girard's work).\n\nIn this way, desire is also an emergent phenomenon – we create cultural memes of success, of lust, of status. Objects are not inherently desirable, but we create collective cultural myths around their value and desirability. I discussed the example of the Louis Vuitton “Urban Satchel Bag” — a purse made of trash which sells for $150,000 [in this post](https://embodied-economics.ghost.io/what-is-life-what-is-economic-value/).\n\nMoney, fundamentally an abstraction of value, is perhaps the best example of an emergent mimetic desire — we create its value by collectively agreeing to it, which then governs our behavior and our desire to acquire it. Something we have fabricated as a species now exerts tremendous power over us in return. What other possibilities might we emerge together?\n\nOnce we understand emergence, we begin to see all of life — starlings, consciousness, democracy, the economy, mimetic desire, our family dynamics, and much more — through this fundamental pattern. And we must embrace these natural patterns and rhythms if we have any chance of co-creating new futures.\n\nAs one of my favorite systems theorists, Donella Meadows, has [said](https://donellameadows.org/archives/dancing-with-systems/?ref=embodied-economics.ghost.io):\n\n> \"The future can’t be predicted, but it can be envisioned and brought lovingly into being. Systems can’t be controlled, but they can be designed and redesigned. We can’t surge forward with certainty into a world of no surprises, but we can expect surprises and learn from them and even profit from them. We can’t impose our will upon a system. We can listen to what the system tells us and discover how its properties and our values can work together to bring forth something much better than could ever be produced by our will alone. **We can’t control systems or figure them out. But we can dance with them!\"**\n\nAnd to end, here's a poem I wrote last year:\n\n![](https://embodied-economics.ghost.io/content/images/2022/01/starling.jpg)\n\n### Starlings\n\nWild undulations like ghostly apparitions,\n\nshape-shifting through daylight.\n\nEach small actor, approximating their movements in relation to their neighbor\n\na proximity and collective intelligence we aspire to\n\nfabricate in circuit boards filled with golden spools.\n\nBut they spin in golden hours, prismatic with possibility.\n\nTheir movement exhibiting emergence, as with our own consciousness.\n\nBoth phenomena that cannot be measured or modelled or _moulded_.\n\nWe spin, awake and asleep — dervishes of striving.\n\n* * *\n\n### _Notes_\n\n• For anyone interested in going deeper on emergence, I found this [free online course from Systems Innovation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QItTWZc7hKs&ref=embodied-economics.ghost.io) incredibly helpful. It's how I first learned about emergence!\n\n• Helpful table on neoclassical vs. complexity economics (for my fellow econ nerds out there) from **[W.

In questioning our fundamental assumptions about intelligence, they explore how radical technological models can decentralize power and become portals into a deeper relationship with the living world.\n\nTranscript\n\nEmmanuel Vaughan-LeeIn your latest book, _Ways of Being_, you explore the many types of intelligences that exist in the more-than-human worlds—intelligences that we need to learn from and integrate into our consciousness and technologies if we are to learn to live in balance with the living world. And you write that for far too long, at least in our dominant Western society, we’ve had a very limited definition and understanding of intelligence that you describe in the book as “what humans do,” and that this definition has played a profound role in shaping technology and how we use it, from computers to, most recently, artificial intelligence. Can you talk about this human-centered definition of intelligence and its impact on technology and AI?\n\nJames BridleI come to this sphere, to this area, to this thinking, from a background in technology. That’s mostly what I’ve worked on for the last decade or more. And a little bit of that focus throughout has been on artificial intelligence. In the last few years, I’ve tried to consciously reframe my practice around more ecological interests while seeing what I could bring from what I know about already. And so the cultural dominance of AI seemed like a really interesting thing to think through, particularly as in my own life I was starting to broaden my own interests and pay more attention to the things around me. And intelligence was an interesting place to start.\n\nI knew, setting out to do this, that I would have to at some point, as a writer about intelligence, define what I meant by intelligence. But I was very frustrated by the lack of what seemed to me to be clear, good definitions of what it is we’re all talking about. You can get all these lists of what people mean when they talk about intelligence, and it’s a kind of grab bag of different qualities that changes all the time: things like planning, counterfactual imagining or coming up with scenarios, theories of mind, tool use, all these different qualities. People pick from them according to whatever their particular field is, but they all come from a human perspective. That seemed to me to be what actually united almost all our common discussions about intelligence: that it was just whatever humans did. And so all our discussions about other potential forms of intelligence, other intelligences that we encountered in the world, or intelligences that we imagined, were all framed in terms of how we understood ourselves and our own thinking. It really struck me that this became an incredibly limiting factor in how we were thinking about intelligence more broadly—and not just intelligence, really, but all relationships we have in the world that are so often mediated by our own intelligence. On the one hand this has restricted our ability to recognize the intelligences of other beings—and I think we’ll probably come to that—but it’s also deeply shaped our history of technology, and particularly AI.\n\nWhat I find fascinating about AI is its cultural weight, the fact that we just seem to be so endlessly fascinated with it. And this goes all the way back to long before the development of modern computers, but really takes off with the development of what we now call computers in the 1940s and 1950s. It goes right back to Alan Turing and the definition of the early computer, when he’s already talking about how intelligent computers might be. And then it extends all the way through the last sixty, seventy years of research, when there’s always this tendency to take whatever the current form of computation is and extrapolate it into what it might be if it was intelligent. And so we’re always trying to build these intelligences, but what we think intelligence is really shapes that. All the different ways we’ve tried to build AI over the years have always been shaped by that definition of human intelligence. And increasingly that’s looked damaging and dangerous, for all the ways that I explore in the book.\n\nEVLYou challenge the notion that AI is actually artificial in the book, and that rather than only embodying the “what humans do” form of intelligence, it has the capacity to help us expand our definition of intelligence. And you ask the question, “What if the meaning of AI is not to be found in the way it competes with, supersedes, or supplants us? What if … its purpose is to open our eyes and minds to the reality of intelligence as something doable in all kinds of fantastic ways, many of them beyond our own rational understanding?” Tell me more about this other purpose of AI.\n\nJBThe more I thought about AI, as I said, I started to really understand it as something that was an incredibly limited vision of what intelligence was. In particular, I focus on what I call corporate AI, or a vision of intelligence that mirrors the corporate model of intelligence, which is something that’s incredibly combative, acquisitive, extractive, profit seeking, that seeks always to dominate and control and increase its own power. That’s the model of a corporation, but it’s also the model of most of the AI that we’re building, because that AI is being built by corporations in their own image. So most of the AI we have at present is this incredibly narrow definition. Yet at the same time, over the last decade, science in general has started to recognize the other ways in which nonhuman beings are intelligent. And so you have this strange kind of parallel process occurring. On the one hand you have the human cultural obsession with artificial intelligence, and on the other hand you have this growing awareness of all these other things that are starting to look a lot like intelligence to us. And something crossed over for me when I understood that as a very narrow definition of intelligence, but also the increasing strangeness of that intelligence as it manifests in the world.\n\nOne of the key things about a lot of the latest forms of AI is that they’re quite obviously not like human intelligence. They’re doing things in systems, like “deep learning,” which are kind of inscrutable to us. They’re not understandable in terms of human cognitive processes, and yet they are clearly doing intelligence things in quite narrow domains. And so it struck me very clearly that while we’ve always insisted on the primacy of our own intelligence and always intended to build AI consciously as a model or a mirror of human intelligence, the fact that it’s actually turning out to be something quite different should tell us something important, which is that there are multiple ways of doing intelligence. And of course, if there’s more than one way of doing intelligence—the human way and this AI way—then of course there are infinite ways of doing intelligence. So for me what AI does, or these realizations about AI, is open up a window to thinking about all the many different forms of intelligence that intelligence could take. And there’s a lot of interesting precedent for this in technological history.\n\nOne of the examples I use a lot is the development of network theory as a result of building the internet. When we started to build the internet, it was a very ad hoc kind of process. People just liked connecting computers together and then building these protocols laid on top of them that would allow the computers to communicate. But these systems started to build up that were unlike any systems that we’d seen before. In particular, we were building what we called a “scale-free network,” where all of the nodes in the network seemed to have a kind of equal weight. It didn’t matter how many connections, inputs, outputs they had. You could take them out, replace them; you could cut bits off—the network would heal around them in an entirely novel way, in a way that we hadn’t encountered before. And one response to this was the development of a new branch of mathematics called network theory, which modeled this way using a different method than previous types of mathematical topology that looked at networks. So we developed this entirely new way of understanding how a network might function. It was only at that point that, retrospectively, mathematics was applied to forest networks, to the networks of trees and mycelium that we now know are communicating at all times in the forest. Now, those networks are not the same thing, but it seems really crucial to me that we needed to build a model in technology for ourselves in order to develop the mental models—the metaphors, really—for seeing this thing existing in the natural world. And it feels to me that possibly this is something that’s happening with AI—the more we build these model toy intelligences, the more we build a potential understanding of all kinds of intelligences. We have this solipsistic need to build it ourselves, to put the pieces together—a really understandable urge, I think—before we can start to recognize the broader processes in the world around us.\n\nEVLThere’s a term you use in the book—“ecology of technology”—that I really love and that you say we need to discover. I wonder if you could unpack this term and share how it offers an alternative to a technology based on human exceptionalism.\n\nJBIf you look back at the history of most sciences over the last 100, 150 years, there’s been an ecological turn within all of the sciences. Every science seems to have discovered its own ecology in turn. It starts out as a very narrow field looking at one particular specialism. And as it develops, it starts to recognize that, actually, it’s a matter of interconnections, it’s a matter of relationships; that the things that matter within any particular discipline are really the ways in which it interconnects with other bodies of knowledge and other ways of knowing the world. This is a thing that has happened to every discipline; it’s not just a biological or natural sciences thing. This happens within mathematics, it happens within sociology, happens within physics. Slowly, as fields expand, when they’re at their best, they become interdisciplinary—about learning from other disciplines. They become ecological. And they also become potentially more aware of their connections to the world, their social and political responsibilities. I think those are a key part of this kind of ecological thinking as well.\n\nAs I put it in the book, it feels like technology—computer science, related disciplines—is the last discipline to discover that ecology, because there’s a deep bias within technology, within computational studies, within the whole field, towards a kind of solipsism, towards a deep abstraction, an assumption that what is happening here belongs entirely in the realm of mathematics, in cold ones and zeros, in an entirely constructed universe that separates itself from the world. But we know this not to be the case. We know this at a practical level, and we know this at a social, physical level. At the very physical level, our machines are built out of the earth. They’re made of materials extracted often violently from the earth in multiple ways, and increasingly troubling ones. They also continue to affect the earth in very important ways. We tunnel through the earth, we bore into it to lay our cables, we build these huge data centers on top of it, which contribute vast amounts of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. So they are engaged materially with the earth.\n\nWe’re also increasingly aware that this technology shapes our societies in incredibly powerful ways. We live in a technologized civilization that is entirely dependent upon technologies but also, through the ways they imagine our society, shapes it in really important ways. And this has been mostly a subject of criticism of technology. It’s barely acknowledged in the field; it’s the kind of position that is largely just put forward by critics. And so I think we’re still awaiting a real ecology of technology, a way of thinking, building, making technology that actually takes this into account from the beginning and starts to acknowledge the fact that technology is as connected as anything else to the world around it.\n\nEVLYou wrote that part of your hope with the book is “to help destroy the idea that there is only one way of being and doing which deserves the name ‘intelligence’—and even, perhaps, that intelligence itself is part of a greater wholeness of living and being that deserves our wider attention, one that isn’t easily classifiable, defined, and by its very nature challenges hierarchy; that there are no single answers or single questions.”\n\nJBThere’s a lot in that statement, which is summing up quite a lot of theses. But one of the things I do in the book, and probably the most joyous part of it, is just to explore what some of those other forms of intelligences look like: the incredible abilities of everything from cephalopods to slime molds; everything from our closest relations—other apes, simians—all the way out to creatures that we can barely imagine, that in all kinds of strange ways demonstrate forms of intelligence. Once you are prepared to pay attention to them—and that’s really, really key—once you are prepared to admit the possibility of their intelligence, it becomes almost instantly undeniable. And so the project, really, then is to integrate that awareness into our lives. But what I learned also by thinking about those forms of intelligence is a kind of parallel realization of the intelligence that I was talking about. The intelligence that I’m interested in is really not an intelligence that just happens inside the head. It’s an intelligence that’s situated in the world.\n\nA good example of this that I always use for humans is the fact that you can go to a place and have a memory related to that place, or extract some kind of information that you would not have been able to do or think or recall without visiting that place. So our memory and intelligence is linked to the physical world beyond our bodies. We can also think of it as simply the fact that we can come up with ideas—we can have conversations that go places in conversation with others; that intelligence is a kind of mutual thing, a thing of relationships; and that the relational nature of it can happen between all different kinds of bodies, and it happens differently depending on the body that you’re in.\n\nMy favorite example of this kind of embodied intelligence is one that’s quite close to the human, which is the gibbon. Famously, for decades now, we’ve been doing all these weird tests on animals to try and decide who gets to join the intelligence club. And they’re all modeled on, of course, how humans do things. So an absolute classic one is tool use. Can you give an animal a tool and see if it reacts in a particular way? Does it use that tool to achieve some kind of goal? And they did these tests for decades on other primates, and most of them do mostly what’s expected in various ways. If you give a gorilla or an orangutan or a chimpanzee a stick and leave some food outside its enclosure, it will use that stick to get the food. Critically, for decades, gibbons didn’t do this. They just seemed fundamentally uninterested in the task at hand, essentially. This posed a real problem for the scientists studying them because it implied that gibbons weren’t as smart as a bunch of their close relatives on the evolutionary tree, including us, but also including animals like baboons and macaques, other monkeys, that we understood to have kind of evolved earlier. And it was only when the framing of this experiment was changed— What happened was, one time the experimenters hung these sticks from the ceiling of the gibbons’ enclosure, and immediately, the gibbons reached up, took the tools, and used them to get the food, because gibbons are brachiators—they live most of their time in the trees. And so they have a body pattern and an awareness that’s upward focused. So it was only when we created a situation in which they would employ their form of intelligence that we were able to recognize it as a kind of intelligence. And that’s a definition of our own blindness to other forms of intelligence. But it also emphasizes this embodied nature of intelligence that I’m talking about, that it matters what kind of body you are in. And also, the recognition of intelligence is this relational process that allows us to make meaning out of it and to relate to one another by understanding it as something that emerges out of relationships.\n\nEVLThere’s a lot of fear around AI, with people like Elon Musk, for example, saying things like it’s summoning the demon—which is the term you used in the book—and that it could destroy us partly because it could become unknowable and uncontrollable and, thus, dangerous, which you could say lies at the core of many of our fears about technology and historically the broader physical world. And in the book you challenge this equation between the unknowable and the dangerous and say that we need to embrace the unpredictable or unknowable, which would have broad implications not just for our relationship with technology, but perhaps could help shift our relationship to the more-than-human world and become very humbling as we recognize we’re not really as in control as we think we are.\n\nJBIt’s really worth maybe casting back a little bit to some things that I’ve written about before. Before this book, I wrote another book, called _New Dark Age_, which was more centrally focused on technology. And one of the things that I investigate in that book quite intensely is this situation of unknowing: the fact that we exist, just at the technological level, in the middle of very large, complex systems that we do not fully understand; that no one person can fully understand—they are of a scale and complexity that is inherently kind of mystifying to us. We will never fully understand their operations. And that is, or can be, a very frightening place to be because it reduces our agency; it makes our every kind of action within that system deeply precarious. What I realized in writing _Ways of Being_ was that a lot of that unknowingness that I was writing about—that gap in our awareness—was also present in the natural world in more interesting and useful ways. In _New Dark Age_ I made the case that we also need to trust that unknowing to some extent, because it is a decentering of the human. It’s a necessary admission that we can’t, in fact, know and control everything, because one of the greatest causes of misery of the present is the overriding desire on the part of some to control the world, to control everything they can and, thus, to profit out of it. That’s a demand for domination, and that’s at the root of most human evil, I would say. And so an admission that we cannot control everything and we cannot know everything—because knowing itself is always a form of control, a form of domination—is a necessary step in acknowledging that we are not at the center of things, that actually we belong to a more-than-human chorus; that if we are prepared to listen to, rather than to know in this aggressive fashion, we can actually live alongside more hopefully.\n\nIt’s very telling to me that the greatest jeremiads against the dangers of AI come from these people who are actually making it and making huge amounts of money out of it, because of course they are the people who have the most to lose if this kind of terrifying AI vision that they have would take over. But really it’s more of a psychological insight into the way that they see the world, because they can only imagine other intelligences as being as dominating as they are. They can only imagine intelligence as being the urge to dominate and control. If there’s one thing one learns by looking at the intelligences of nonhumans—and, in fact, of non-rich people in many forms—it’s that that is not the only way to be intelligent in the world.\n\nEVLYou talk about how the computational environment and the natural one are perhaps not as distinct and separate as we might imagine. And that acknowledging that the computational environment exerts a transformative influence upon us in a similar way as the natural world once did could allow us to realize several important things: (1) that this influence matters, (2) that the computational environment is continuous with the natural one, and (3) that acknowledging the reality of our technological landscape in which we’re embedded might allow us to reimagine our relationship with the biosphere. Could you talk about this and about this reimagining?\n\nJBOnce again, that’s a concatenation of quite a lot of points into one, but I’ll try and back it up a little bit.\n\nEVLThat’s a big question.\n\nJBOf course. It is the one that I try to answer in the book. Again, we live inside this myth of technological superiority that is predicated in large part on the separation of ourselves from the environment, as though those are two entirely separate things. And the myth of technology supports that because it tells us that we can become autonomous from the environment. So much of the mostly unconscious but often conscious intention of the way that we build technologies is to separate the human from the environment in so many ways. And that goes for nondigital technologies: most of the clothes we make and all these practices that we engage in all the time also have similar things. But network technology, modern high technology, takes it to the cognitive level, where it says that we can think and live entirely separate from the world around us. And as I said in talking about the way that technology actually operates, as something that is embedded in the world and implicated in it in so many ways, that’s an illusion, and it’s an illusion we really need to break with.\n\nOne of the operating principles of my work is that we have all of these metaphors in our heads of the ways in which we relate to the world, and what I try to do is unpick some of these dominant metaphors to show how they actually, if considered another way, allow us a different access to the world around us. So every time we build some kind of tool that is intended to separate us from the world, I always feel that if you parse it slightly differently, it reveals within itself this constant reinforcing reconnection to the world.\n\nEVLYou spoke about Alan Turing earlier and his influence on the development of modern computing. And it was interesting, because I learned in the book that at the same time he developed what became known as the Turing machine in the 1930s, or the automatic machine—which, as I understand it, is given instructions and tasks that it completes or computes, which has become the basis of modern computing—he developed a different kind of idea for a machine, which he called the oracle machine. Could you talk about these two different machines and why the oracle machine might be so relevant to us now?\n\nJBIt’s just so endlessly fascinating to me to go back right into the moment of birth of the modern computer and see, laid out right in a couple of Turing’s original papers, this entirely alternative vision that was almost never followed up in any way. When Turing first describes what we now know today as the Turing machine, which he called the automatic machine, he leaves hanging an alternative vision. It is really important to understand that what we call the Turing machine, and he called the automatic machine, is almost all computers today—like, 99.9999 percent of computers today. Your laptop, your phone, the computer we’re talking through now, the ATM, the flight-control system, even the biggest supercomputers in the world—they’re all Turing machines, and they’re all one type of machine. They’re one possible way of thinking the world.\n\nTuring called it an automatic machine because it’s simply a machine that acts out a step-by-step process. It does whatever you tell it to do, in Turing’s words. That also makes it a kind of closed system, right? It just takes a set of instructions and steps through them, and it has very little awareness of anything else outside the world of its own programming and the set of its controls. But at the same time, as he defined the automatic machine, Turing also mentioned incredibly briefly this thing called the oracle machine. He literally says we will not say anything about the oracle machine except, of course, that it cannot be a machine, which is an incredibly brilliant paradoxical statement. But the oracle is literally something else communicating with the computer. So instead of just having an automated machine—this completely self-contained computational object, a kind of tiny set of instructions in a box—you have something that is capable of communicating with the wider world; not just communicating but listening to it, taking some kind of prompt from it. And this is the kind of computation that was subsequently explored by fields like cybernetics, various kinds of robotics, basically computer systems that tried to look to the world around them to understand something.\n\nMy classic example of an oracle machine is, quite appropriately, a random-number generator. One of the real problems of computer systems is that they can’t generate true random numbers, because of course they’re just stepping through this set of automatic processes. And you can’t create randomness—i.e., something completely unexpected—by going through a set of programmed expected steps. And random numbers are really necessary. They’re needed for cryptographics, for credit card transactions, for lotteries, for example. And lottery machines have come up with all kinds of weird ways of generating randomness. There’s a reason they still use those ball-juggling machines, but they also do other things. There’s a series of British computers for picking lottery numbers that used neon tubes. So you connect the computer to a neon tube and you measure the electrical flux within that tube. Because that tube is connected to the universe. The electrical flux within the gas in that tube is affected by radio particles passing through, cosmic particles coming through the space. You’ve connected the computer to the universe and it’s listening to the universe to tell it something that it can’t do from a step-by-step process. That’s an oracle machine, right? It’s a computer that acknowledges its connection to the universe, to the world around that.\n\nFor me that’s a kind of refutation of everything we’ve built into almost all the computers that we have; because it shows the way in which all the computers that we have, and thus the world that those computers have contributed to building, are blind in all these crucial ways to the truth of the world. That the world is composed of interrelationships. That the world is more than human, more than human intelligence; that it is an ecological world. Computers have ignored that, most of them, since the foundations of computation. And that’s one of the big reasons we have the kind of world that we have. But as I wrote in the book, and as Turing suggested all those years ago, an entirely different form of computation is possible. And also—through my thinking, and through this fact that the technological is actually continuous with the rest of the world—another kind of thinking is possible for us as well. Computation has come to define the way that we think. We think so much like computers today because they’ve defined what is thinkable. And so for me, rethinking the computer rethinks what is computable, and therefore rethinks what is thinkable at all about the world.\n\nEVLIt makes us blind, but it also leads to violence. You talk about this in the book, especially the reduction of the beauty of the world as a form of violence, and how numbers and data contribute to this. And this obviously in turn led to exploitation and destruction. Part of this happens when computers make models of the world, which of course makes it abstract and then distant. Can you talk about this and how we could move away from this violent abstraction and model for machines?\n\nJBAgain, another of these properties of things like the Turing machine—like all computers, essentially—is that they think the world in ones and zeros; they think the world digitally. And the world is not digital; the world is analog. And I don’t mean that in terms of fuzzy records versus clean MP3s or something like that, though there is a corresponding kind of reduction in quality. But this is not some kind of nostalgic appeal. It’s simply the fact that the world is not divided into ones and zeros. And when you try and put everything into ones and zeros, something is lost. What happens in between those ones and zeros is lost, and the result of that is a deep violence, because what is lost is either erased or violently suppressed; because then you’ve started to act in the world according to the model that the computer provides. And you try to make the world more like the model. We are model-building creatures. It’s the way that our consciousness operates. We’re continually building a model of the world and essentially trying to make the world more like the model and the model more like the world—it’s what’s called being normative. We try and get those models to converge. But those models don’t really converge: one of them is digital and one of them is analog, or one of them is internal to a machine and one of them is the world itself. And so a huge amount of violence is the result of that. It is a violence that’s as much to our own ability to think as it is to the external world.\n\nThere are alternatives to this way of thinking and looking at the world. One thing I explore in the book quite extensively is this idea of analog computing. The 0.0001 percent of computers that aren’t Turing machines are incredibly fascinating and diverse. So an example of an analog computer, one of my favorites that I first encountered in the science museum in London when I was a small child, is a thing called the MONIAC. The MONIAC is a computer for simulating the British economy, and it’s made largely out of water. It’s the size of a big refrigerator, and it has a tank of water at the top and various pipes running down it. And then there are buckets marked with things like “personal savings,” “public spending,” “tax revenue,” and there are lots of little taps, little valves, that you can turn to tune things like various tax rates, the quantity of imports and exports. What is flowing through this computer is not ones and zeros, but water. It’s this beautiful enactment of a bunch of economical metaphors, really. We hear about the fluidity of markets and these kind of things, because they are qualities. Even as much as the market itself is a kind of inhuman abstraction, it does reflect the flow of the world itself, this kind of chaos that it presents. And it turns out that this computer that was built, this MONIAC, modeled this better than any other way that had been developed at the time. It was originally built as a teaching tool at the London School of Economics, but it proved to be so successful at modeling the economy that they built versions and used them in government departments to actually develop budgets, and so on and so forth.\n\nThere’s a point in there that’s very critical for thinking about how we make technology, which is about making things that are legible—because you can stand in front of that machine and you can understand how it works. And that’s not true of most of the machines that we build. So there’s something very powerful in having access to a technology where you can literally see how it works, and that changes how you interact with it. And that’s a very rare experience these days. But also I think it’s really important because it is a nonbinary computer. It’s a computer that recognizes the chaos and flux of the world rather than trying to split it and condense it and reduce it to a lesser representation of ones and zeros. You can also do it more extensively: something that more explicitly connects with the world, which is where a discipline like cybernetics comes in. Cybernetics has taken many forms, but one of its core understandings is that cognition, the brain, intelligence, is not a static thing: it’s something that is performed and done in the world and responsive to the world; and so it’s something that’s changeable and flexible and that evolves over time. That kind of evolution, that kind of flexibility, is something that natural systems are capable of doing in ways that technological systems really have never been able to, and probably never will be able to, if they are entirely constrained and contained within boxes. But by connecting these systems to larger, nonmechanical, nonhuman systems, you can bring in some of that awareness and thinking. Some of the stories I tell in the book are about people like Stafford Beer, who built attempts at computers involving ponds and tiny marine organisms and tried to get them to interact with complex computer systems as a way of counteracting this conservative, constrained impulse of digital computation.\n\nEVLYou offered so many interesting examples of ecological machines, and you also, though, broke down what you propose as a better way to approach creating machines. And you mentioned nonbinary, but you also talk about the importance of decentralized systems and unknowing, which is related to randomness. Could you unpack the importance of nonbinary, decentralized, and unknowing-based systems and what these would offer?\n\nJBThis is really a response to the way that I’ve come to understand how our contemporary computational systems operate, which is that they are centralizing binary and are based on systems of domination and control. And so the way in which we build computers today is largely centralizing. It centralizes power within certain computer systems, and those certain computer systems are owned by large corporations or nation states. And so the effect of most of our technology at present is to give power to the already powerful, not just by centralizing that power but also by centralizing the knowledge of how that power operates, so that very, very few people, as I said before, really understand how the things that we use every day actually work. That’s incredibly dangerous because it means power is handed over to a very small part of society that operates and owns these systems. And our agency, the agency of everyone else, is massively reduced because we can only do the things that are permitted to us by these systems, which are controlled by other people. That centralization, which is part and parcel of most of the way that we build technological systems today, is incredibly damaging.\n\nThe first principle I have of more just and equal ways of thinking about building technologies is decentralization, which means spreading the tools of computation as broadly and widely as possible. And of course education, then, is a huge part of this. Any technological problem at sufficient scale is really a political one. The political problem of decentralization is largely one of education. It’s not enough just to turn these tools over to people. We also need to have an education process, hopefully a collaborative one, in the use of those things so that people can imagine them anew. A couple of examples of decentralized technology that I always come back to are things like the open-source movement, the movement within programming that allows anyone to read the source code of programs, which sounds like an obvious thing to do but actually is not how most software is produced. Most software is proprietary. You don’t know how it works and you can’t know how it works because you can’t see the source code. By opening that up, you allow people to understand how the things around them work, but you also decentralize the knowledge of how that’s worked. And because being able to see the code is also a way of learning not just about that particular piece of code but how all code functions, you’re decentralizing a much broader understanding and literacy. And of course that decentralization is a political act. You’re spreading the power literally among more and more people. In the old web that we used to use, you could always view the source code. You still can see the source of some web pages, but most of the operation of the internet now is basically closed source. You can’t look at the “view source” of a website and see how it works anymore because that’s not how the web works—by design of the powerful. So that centralization process is still ongoing, even through something as apparently decentralized as the web, which has become incredibly centralized.\n\nThe second thing is this question of nonbinariness. As I said, binary computation is the way we’ve come to think all computation should be, and hence all thinking. It lies behind so much of our construction of society, and thus also the constructions of hierarchies within those societies. Because when everything has to be assigned a role within a binary system, the relationships between things in that system become immediately hierarchical, because there’s no other way to differentiate between them. And so an insistence upon the nonbinariness of our thinking as a result of the possibilities of nonbinaries within computation changes our relationships to everything within our own society and species: towards things like gender and sexuality, crucially, but also all other relationships between people, relationships towards the world. There’s a big part of the book in which I talk about how our notions of things apparently as big and heavy and weighty and historical as species are really starting to fall apart. Our understanding of even how species are separated through evolutionary processes has come under incredible sustained attack within the last few decades as we come to understand things like horizontal gene transfer, viral genes transfer, the fact that DNA does not only get written down the line through parental reproduction but actually could be rewritten across and between individuals. Not only have we started to lose our ability to draw such fine lines between species, we’re even starting to lose the concept of an individual at all. We know now that we are not singular, atomic individuals, but we are ourselves walking, multispecies assemblies, and the language of binariness just doesn’t hold at almost any level—at the individual level, at the species level, at the planetary level. And so to continue to build our machines—through which we categorize, understand, and think the world in a binary model—doesn’t work anymore and requires total rethinking. That’s where the nonbinary requirement comes in.\n\nAnd finally, the unknowing is a way of thinking the world without seeking to know it in this form of domination and control that’s deeply rooted in Enlightenment ideas and also in much of science. The ways we have of knowing the world destroy the world: whether that’s our colonialist, imperialist ways of overruling non-Western cultures with a Western way of viewing and understanding them, whether it’s the scientific practice of splitting everything down into its component parts and understanding the world mechanically, it literally destroys it as a process of knowing it and comes to dominate and rule what remains. We need another way of thinking about the world, another way of coming into understanding agreement, becoming with it, that doesn’t depend on knowing it in this kind of destructive, domineering way. And that’s why I talk about unknowing. Unknowing is not the same as ignorance. It’s not a blindness to the world, but it’s a refusal to project our own forms of thinking directly onto it in a way that obscures its actual reality.\n\nEVLWhen you talk about unknowing in your book, it evokes this sense of the importance of embracing mystery, which is a foundation in so many spiritual and mystical traditions and ways of being—the unknowable that creates awe and humbleness about how we relate to the world. And you don’t speak about the spiritual or mystical side directly, but it seems to be an underlying theme through your book—the spiritual side of needing to see how we relate to the world—that these relationships and technologies might need to be spiritual as well.\n\nJBIt’s something that I think about a lot and struggle to write about. But to get to my own experience, let me use the example of someone who I think you’ve—I dunno if you’ve had them on the show before but you’ve certainly mentioned—Monica Gagliano, whose work was hugely influential to me in understanding many things, but particularly the fact that it’s possible to approach an understanding with the world through multiple ways of understanding it, multiple approaches. Her experiments in the existence of plant memory are rigorous scientific experiments that she designed according to the scientific method that allow her to make these extraordinary, powerful, and persuasive claims about the abilities of plants to remember and to do all kinds of other extraordinary things. And they’re constructed in such a way that they fit within the scientific method—they’re reproducible, they’re peer reviewed—but she’s also very explicit about the fact that she has a shamanic practice and had spiritual communication with the plants as well, and that this informed her ability to communicate with the plants in order to prepare them and work with them on the scientific side.\n\nAnd I, too, have had encounters with plant spirits through the use of ayahuasca that deeply informed this writing. But even I struggle to bring those different ways of thinking and knowing together. That’s a huge part, I think, of what I’m doing in the book: finding a way within some of the discourses that I’m more familiar with and that I’m more comfortable writing in—and that a lot of other people might be able to follow more clearly—that also expresses what I consider to be the deep interconnectedness of everything on an entirely different dimensional level. That is absolutely fundamental to what I understand. But I’ve come to it, like Gagliano, along these multiple paths. I come to it through an open spiritual encounter with the world around me. And I also come to it through thinking through these deeply human technological models of thinking the world. To me they point towards the same thing, and for me that strengthens or empowers both approaches in a really powerful way, that you come to a lot of the same conclusions about our relationship with the world if you think deeply along any one of these lines. But the fact that they all converge seems to me to be the most powerful quality that they have.\n\nEVLTowards the end of the book, you write about solidarity, which you describe as “that form of politics which best describes a yearning towards entanglement, to the mutual benefit of all parties, and sets itself against division and hierarchy,” that we must “declare solidarity with the more-than-human world,” and that “solidarity is a product of imagination as well as of action.” What does solidarity with the more-than-human world look like to you?\n\nJBIt looks like the awareness and care and attention that I’ve been maybe hinting at throughout this conversation. First of all, it implies a deep, deep equality. It says that there is no justification, no place for any kind of human superiority in our relationships. But crucially, solidarity also removes the requirement for knowing, in all the dangerous ways I’ve been describing. There’s a common understanding that it’s only possible to really care for things that one understands on some kind of deep level. This is related to the failure of human empathy, the fact that we are only really capable of caring deeply, it seems quite often, for quite a close, narrow circle. And even those people who are far away from us in distance or in cultural experience, we seem as a society to find it harder to care for them because we cannot imagine ourselves into their experience. It isn’t deeply necessary for us to care and to think with all forms of being, who we cannot imagine ourselves into. This is part of the unknowing that I was talking about earlier, because it’s impossible for us to know what it’s like to be so many other forms of being. And yet we have the same goals in mind, which are surviving and thriving on this planet. And we share this world.\n\nThese are the lessons that I draw from my understanding of the extraordinary abilities and life worlds of nonhuman beings: that as much as our worlds differ radically, we share a world. We inhabit the same world as all of these nonhuman creatures. That is our deep and shared connection. And for me, it is necessary once we start to acknowledge the reality and the agency of nonhumans—as we’ve always struggled to acknowledge the agency of and beinghood of many humans—it is necessary to build a politics that enfolds all of that. And by “politics,” more broadly, I mean the ability to think and make decisions together, hopefully for our common benefit. And the politics that best fits that, for me, is this idea of solidarity, which simply starts from the position that you—unknowable you; unknowably, incredibly different you, who I cannot imagine—I still care for you and value you and think you are as important, and I will stand with you. That, for me, is the heart of solidarity. It’s a simple acknowledgment of the value of all forms of life and of our common, shared goals that have to lie at the heart of any movement towards a more just and equal world.\n\nEVLAnd solidarity now means ecological politics just as much as it means ecological technology, right? There’s a demand for that, to embrace the more than human in the political system and the technological system that we’re being thrown towards realizing.\n\nJBFor me there’s just no meaning to having a discussion about changing technological systems, changing political systems, without the acknowledgment that we have to include more than humans into those arrangements. Because that’s the absolute necessary step beyond acknowledging that humans are not the only game in town, that human supremacism has to be done with. We have to work out how we go on together. How do we make decisions together? In the book I explore quite extensively the world of nonhuman politics in all its forms. I look at the ways in which nonhuman animals do politics within their own societies, whether that’s the decision-making processes of herds of deer, whether it’s the ways in which bees perform a form of direct democracy to make decisions within their hives.\n\nEVLThe waggle dance.\n\nJBThe waggle dance, exactly—this incredibly complex way of communicating information that allows a large group to make a decision that is also an incredibly optimal decision-making strategy to bring as many different points of view to bear upon a practice. There are all these ways in which animals do politics, and there are all these other ways in which animals, nonhumans have done that politics in relation to humans over time. I look at medieval animal trials—early examples of having nonhumans within the human justice system. I look at the history of animals within captivity and the ways in which they demonstrate their politics through resistance to that captivity. And so if we are beginning to acknowledge the fact that nonhumans have all of this agency and that they do politics in all kinds of ways, then we have to develop a politics that includes them. I think that’s absolutely necessary. It’s an absolute foundation for any kind of ecological justice and collective future flourishing. If we don’t put nonhumans on the same level as humans within our decision-making processes, then all of that is meaningless. A fundamental step towards a brighter future is a more-than-human politics that is as broad and inclusive as we can possibly imagine, and probably more so.\n\nEVLI have just one last question for you, James, and that’s about optimism and hope, which you wrote about in one of your latest blog posts, titled “Hope Needs a Place to Perch,” where you talk about how “optimism, pessimism, hope, and despair are not useful ways of thinking about the present crisis.” So talk to me about this and what hope needing a place to perch means.\n\nJBIt’s nice that you’ve picked up on that because it’s something that I’m still thinking through and trying to understand myself. The book that I mentioned earlier, _New Dark Age_, that concentrated on technology included quite a section on climate, including a chapter on the climatic implications of high technology. And I learned a lot in writing that, a lot of things that terrified me, to be completely honest. And it seemed to strike a chord with readers as well. It’s something that gets cited back to me quite a lot. A lot of the work that I’ve been doing ever since has been a process of addressing and attempting to understand and deal with my own climate grief and trauma, which I know to be entirely real things because I have experienced them and I continue to experience them in all kinds of ways. And so part of this book was looking for ways through that, ways of understanding that.\n\nThe thing that I refer to a lot in both books is this concept of agency. Agency, for me, is the ability to know where one is, to understand one’s own position, to have one’s own capabilities, and to have the ability to affect and change one’s own life, in as broad a range of ways of thinking as possible. It’s something that is under huge pressure for most of us. It’s something that is taken away from us actively in many, many ways, and something that we struggle to realize in so many ways. The crisis of agency in the present moment—which is an effect of capitalist systems of control; an effect of the kinds of technology and the systems we have to engage with all the time that limit us in so many ways— I feel that that loss of agency—the collapse of political consensus and meaningful politics at a state or global level; the horror that strikes us and our sense of fear and anger that results, that being the dominant tenor of the world today—is a result of that loss of agency.\n\nSo how do you rebuild that agency? I do it through doing what I do, which is trying to think about and understand things in the world, by learning about things and hopefully listening, paying attention to the world around me, putting some of these ideas together. Those, for me, are a way of rebuilding agency, and that’s my response to climate trauma and grief as well, it turns out. It’s been the most effective thing for me. A good example of that is, a few years ago I started tinkering around with solar panels. Really, really, simple stuff, just learning to wire them up and so forth, going back to basic electronics. But I discovered within that the same expansion of agency that I did when I first started tinkering with computers; I felt I had an agency within this complex system. Now, I don’t think solar panels alone are going to save us or anything like that, but I felt for the first time that I was engaging with something that mattered within this complex environmental ecological system, that up to that point had only been something that was essentially oppressing me, frightening me, worrying me, and knocking me down. And that work has continued through all kinds of making. I spend a lot of my time now working on forms of really simple regenerative technology, things like permaculture—things that I do in part because I think they will help in some abstruse way. I think that’s the least one can do. But also because they are psychologically comforting in the sense that they build my sense of agency.\n\nWithout that sense of agency, we’re incapable of doing anything at all. That is the place that hope needs to perch on, that I’m trying to articulate: that hope without any foundation of actual agency, any thinking, any knowledge, any ability to make or do change in various ways, is a meaningless thing. Like optimism. They’re not quite the same thing, but for me they’re closely related in that they’re just words without some kind of basis of action. And that action can be as simple as building a little wooden box in your garden to purify water, which is something that I’ve been doing this week. Or it can be as big as developing computer programs to analyze satellite photographs. Whatever it is, it doesn’t have to be the one piece that will save the world, but it definitely has to be something that increases one’s own psychological sense of ability to make change that is a prerequisite for any other kind of hope or optimism that we might face.\n\nEVLIt’s been a pleasure speaking with you today, James. Thank you so much.\n\nJBThank you very much for having me.\n\n- [Email](mailto:?&subject=Emergence%20Magazine%3A%20An%20Ecological%20Technology&body=An%20Ecological%20Technology%0AAn%20Interview%20with%20James%20Bridle%0A%0AIn%20this%20interview%2C%20writer%2C%20artist%2C%20and%20technologist%20James%20Bridle%20questions%20our%20fundamental%20assumptions%20about%20intelligence%20and%20explores%20how%20radical%20technological%20models%20can%20become%20portals%20into%20deeper%20relationship%20with%20the%20living%20world.%20%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Femergencemagazine.org%2Fconversation%2Fan-ecological-technology%2F)\n- Copy link\n\nShare this story\n\n- [Apple Podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/emergence-magazines-podcast/id1368790239)\n- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5YpLJHG91UvDVvq8xnajuT?si=tPgFos-tReWHBxX4mgzNPw)\n\nSubscribe to our podcast\n\n- [Email](mailto:?&subject=Emergence%20Magazine%3A%20An%20Ecological%20Technology&body=An%20Ecological%20Technology%0AAn%20Interview%20with%20James%20Bridle%0A%0AIn%20this%20interview%2C%20writer%2C%20artist%2C%20and%20technologist%20James%20Bridle%20questions%20our%20fundamental%20assumptions%20about%20intelligence%20and%20explores%20how%20radical%20technological%20models%20can%20become%20portals%20into%20deeper%20relationship%20with%20the%20living%20world.%20%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Femergencemagazine.org%2Fconversation%2Fan-ecological-technology%2F)\n- Copy link\n\nShare this story\n\n- [Apple Podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/emergence-magazines-podcast/id1368790239)\n- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5YpLJHG91UvDVvq8xnajuT?si=tPgFos-tReWHBxX4mgzNPw)\n\nSubscribe to our podcast\n\n![](https://emergencemagazine.org/app/uploads/2022/06/I-Am-Everywhere_Sydney-Cain_WR_prtrt_THUMB.jpg)\n\nEssay\n\n### [My Name Is Beauty](https://emergencemagazine.org/essay/my-name-is-beauty/)\n\nby Jake Skeets\n\nAugust 31, 2022\n\n![](https://emergencemagazine.org/app/uploads/2022/03/Navigating-Thumb-Portrait.jpg)\n\nEssay\n\n### [Navigating the Mysteries](https://emergencemagazine.org/essay/navigating-the-mysteries/)\n\nby Martin Shaw\n\nMay 12, 2022\n\n![](https://emergencemagazine.org/app/uploads/2021/11/Ghosh_Amitav_photocredit_Sumit_Dayal_prtrt_THUMB.jpg)\n\nConversation\n\n### [Beings Seen and Unseen](https://emergencemagazine.org/conversation/beings-seen-and-unseen/)\n\nAn Interview with Amitav Ghosh\n\nAugust 31, 2022\n41 min\n\n![](https://emergencemagazine.org/app/uploads/2021/01/quote-4_webready-scaled-1464x2200.jpg)\n\nEssay\n\n### [Magic and the Machine](https://emergencemagazine.org/essay/magic-and-the-machine/)\n\nby David Abram\n\nOctober 17, 2018\n\n![](https://emergencemagazine.org/app/uploads/2021/02/Mockett_Lyon_thumb.jpg)\n\nEssay\n\n### [Thirteen to One](https://emergencemagazine.org/essay/thirteen-to-one/)\n\nby Marie Mutsuki Mockett\n\nFebruary 3, 2021\n\n![](https://emergencemagazine.org/app/uploads/2020/11/A-Z.IrishTreeAlphabet_600px_THUMB.jpg)\n\nEssay\n\n### [Deciphering Words in the Woods](https://emergencemagazine.org/essay/deciphering-words-in-the-woods/)\n\nby Katie Holten\n\nNovember 20, 2020\n\nEmergence Magazine’s Newsletter\n\nThanks for signing up for our newsletter (:\n\nSign up to receive our newsletter each Sunday morning!

      "content": "[Jump to content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#bodyContent)\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nMeasure of a civilization's evolution\n\n\"The Kardashev Scale\" and \"Galactic civilization\" redirect here. For the album by Greydon Square, see [_The Kardashev Scale_ (album)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kardashev_Scale_(album) \"The Kardashev Scale (album)\"). For the video game, see [_Galactic Civilizations_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Civilizations \"Galactic Civilizations\").\n\nThe **Kardashev scale** ( [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language \"Russian language\"): шкала Кардашёва, [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Russian \"Romanization of Russian\"): _shkala Kardashyova_) is a method of measuring a [civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization \"Civilization\")'s level of [technological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology \"Technology\") advancement based on the amount of [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy \"Energy\") it is capable of harnessing and using. The measure was proposed by Soviet astronomer [Nikolai Kardashev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Kardashev \"Nikolai Kardashev\") in 1964,[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1964-1) and was named after him.\n\nKardashev first outlined his scale in a paper presented at the 1964 conference that communicated findings on BS-29-76, [Byurakan Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byurakan_Conference \"Byurakan Conference\") in the [Armenian SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic \"Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic\"), which he initiated, a scientific meeting that reviewed the Soviet [radio astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy \"Radio astronomy\") space listening program. The paper was titled \"Передача информации внеземными цивилизациями\" (\"Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations\").[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1964-1) Starting from a functional definition of civilization, based on the immutability of [physical laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law \"Physical law\") and using [human civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_civilization \"Human civilization\") as a model for [extrapolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapolation \"Extrapolation\"), Kardashev's initial model was developed. He proposed a classification of civilizations into three types, based on the [axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom \"Axiom\") of [exponential growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth \"Exponential growth\"):\n\n- A [**Type I** civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_civilization \"Planetary civilization\") is able to access all the [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy \"Energy\") available on its [planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet \"Planet\") and store it for consumption.\n- A **Type II** civilization can directly consume a [star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star \"Star\")'s energy, most likely through the use of a [Dyson sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere \"Dyson sphere\").\n- A **Type III** civilization is able to capture all the energy emitted by its [galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy \"Galaxy\"), and every object within it, such as every star, [black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole \"Black hole\"), etc.\n\nUnder this scale, the sum of human civilization does not reach Type I status, though it continues to approach it. Extensions of the scale have since been proposed, including a wider range of power levels (Types 0, IV, and V) and the use of metrics other than pure power, e.g., [computational growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_Law \"Moore's Law\") or [food consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioenergetics \"Bioenergetics\").[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kaku-2007-2)[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Entering_Space-3)\n\nIn a second article, entitled \"Strategies of Searching for Extraterrestrial Intelligence\", published in 1980, Kardashev wonders about the ability of a civilization, which he defines by its ability to access energy, to sustain itself, and to integrate information from its environment.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1980-4) Two more articles followed: \"On the Inevitability and the Possible Structure of Super Civilizations\" and \"Cosmology and Civilizations\", published in 1985 and 1997, respectively;[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev1985-5)[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1997-6) the Soviet astronomer proposed ways to detect super civilizations and to direct the [SETI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence \"Search for extraterrestrial intelligence\") (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) programs. A number of scientists have conducted searches for possible civilizations, but with no conclusive results.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-7) However, in part thanks to such searches, unusual objects, now known to be either [pulsars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar \"Pulsar\") or [quasars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar \"Quasar\"), were identified.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-cosmic_search-8)\n\n## Origin of the classification\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Origin of the classification\")\\]\n\n### First publication (1964)\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: First publication (1964)\")\\]\n\n[![A red dotted line that goes up from left to right.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/KScale.svg/700px-KScale.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KScale.svg) A projection of the Kardashev scale to 2040 based on data from the International Energy Agency World Energy Outlook\n\nKardashev presented for the first time a classification of civilizations according to the level of the rate of their energy consumption, or ability to harness power, in an article entitled _Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations_, published in 1964 first in Russian in the March–April issue of the _[Astronomicheskii Zhurnal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_Reports \"Astronomy Reports\")_,[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1964-1) then in English in the September–October 1964 issue of the Soviet Astronomical Journal.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1964-1) In this article, the scientist presents a calculation of the evolution of the power needs of humanity. Assuming that overall human power use will continue to increase, he calculated that the rate of energy consumption will cross specific mileposts. Kardashev proposed a typology of technological civilizations based on the evolutive attainment of the three power harnessing mileposts he described.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1964-1)[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-9)\n\nA [civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization \"Civilization\") known as \"Type I\" has achieved a technological level close to the one attained on Earth at the time Kardashev's article was submitted (December 1963), with a rate of energy consumption evaluated at about 4 x 1012 [watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt \"Watt\") (W). A civilization known as \"Type II\" would surpass the first by fourteen orders of magnitude, matching the entire power emitted by the Sun in about 3,200 years, i.e, Earth's home [star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star \"Star\")'s \"output\" at that time, predicted at 4 × 1026 W. Finally, a civilization known as \"Type III\" reaches the milepost set in 5,800 years when humanity's rate of energy consumption is predicted by the author to match the power emitted by the approximated 1011 stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which involves harnessing power of up to an estimated 4 x 1037 W.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1964-1)\n\nAssuming the development of [radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio \"Radio\"), Kardashev predicted that in the following two decades (i.e. in the 1980s) it would be possible to build antennas of 100,000 m2 capable of detecting Type II and III civilizations. A Type I civilization like that of Earth would be able to receive the extraordinary energetic emissions of the other types of civilizations, which would supposedly be able to emit continuously.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1964-1)[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Gal%C3%A1ntai-2003-10)\n\nKardashev then examined the characteristics of a transmission from an artificial source. He mentioned the two cosmic radio sources discovered in 1963 by the [California Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology \"California Institute of Technology\"), CTA-21 and [CTA-102](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTA-102 \"CTA-102\") in particular, which would have characteristics close to those of a presumed artificial source. The most suitable region of the galaxy for observing Type II and III civilizations would then be the [Galactic Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Center \"Galactic Center\"), due to the high density of the stellar population it harbors. He then recommended that the search programs for such artificial sources should focus on other nearby galaxies, such as the [Andromeda Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy \"Andromeda Galaxy\"), the [Magellanic Clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellanic_Clouds \"Magellanic Clouds\"), [M87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87 \"Messier 87\"), or [Centaurus A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaurus_A \"Centaurus A\"). Kardashev concluded his paper by noting that the possible discovery of even the simplest organisms on [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars \"Mars\") would increase the likelihood that Type II civilizations exist in the galaxy.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1964-1)\n\n[![Three schematic representations: Earth, Solar System and Milky Way](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Consommations_%C3%A9nerg%C3%A9tiques_des_trois_types_de_l%27%C3%A9chelle_de_Kardashev.svg/1000px-Consommations_%C3%A9nerg%C3%A9tiques_des_trois_types_de_l%27%C3%A9chelle_de_Kardashev.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Consommations_%C3%A9nerg%C3%A9tiques_des_trois_types_de_l%27%C3%A9chelle_de_Kardashev.svg) Energy consumption in three types of civilization as defined by Sagan's extended Kardashev scale\n\n### Second publication (1980)\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Second publication (1980)\")\\]\n\n#### Towards an energetic definition of civilization\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Towards an energetic definition of civilization\")\\]\n\nIn 1980, Nikolai Kardashev published a second article entitled _Strategies of Searching for Extraterrestrial Intelligence: A Fundamental Approach to the Basic Problem,_[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1980-4) in which he stated that:\n\n> Detection and studies of extraterrestrial civilizations constitute a problem of immense significance for the progress of humanity and for its culture and philosophy. The discovery of intelligent life in the Universe would provide a guideline to the possible development of our civilization over astronomical time spans.\n\n— Nikolai Kardashev, Strategies of Searching for Extraterrestrial Intelligence: A Fundamental Approach to the Basic Problem\n\n[![A broken line in blue goes, from left to right, from the bottom to the top](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Annual_world_primary_energy_consumption.svg/1000px-Annual_world_primary_energy_consumption.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Annual_world_primary_energy_consumption.svg) A graph of world [primary energy consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_supply_and_consumption \"World energy supply and consumption\") in 2011 according to the BP _Statistical Review_\n\nAccording to the Soviet astronomer, the Earth's civilization would be too young to be able to contact another civilization that would certainly be more advanced; the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System \"Solar System\") is too young with its five billion years, and the first ancestors of today's man appeared only 6 million years ago at the earliest;[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-11) the oldest celestial objects are between 10 and 14 billion years old; it is clear that the other civilizations are incomparably older than the human civilization. Therefore, the knowledge of these civilizations must be greater than Earth's, and, he reasoned, they must surely be aware of what humans are doing.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1980-4)\n\nKardashev believed it is probable that the present state of Earth's civilization is only one of the stages through which civilizations pass during their evolution. It is thus possible to define [civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization \"Civilization\") on the basis of this universal characteristic, which allowed [Aleksandr Lyapunov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Lyapunov \"Aleksandr Lyapunov\") to define life as \"a highly stable state of matter, which uses information encoded by the states of individual molecules to produce maintaining reactions\", which Kardashev calls the \"functional definition of civilization\".[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1980-4) He therefore suggests thinking of civilization as a \"highly stable state of matter capable of acquiring, making abstract analysis of, and utilizing information to obtain qualitatively new information about its environment and about itself, to improve its capabilities of gathering new information for producing sustaining reactions.\"[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1980-4)\n\nCivilization is therefore characterized by the quality of the [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information \"Information\") acquired by its operating program, and by the [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy \"Energy\") required to implement these functions. By \"information about its environment and about itself\", Kardashev specified that it is data about organic or inorganic nature, [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science \"Science\"), [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology \"Technology\"), [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy \"Economy\"), [culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture \"Culture\"), [arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_arts \"The arts\"), etc. From this definition, he proposed a diagram representing the interactions between a civilization and its environment, and enumerated a number of scientific problems arising from these interactions with the information available in the Universe.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1980-4)\n\nFrom this definition, Kardashev drew three conclusions. The first postulated that because of the vast and unlimited set of activities required by scientific problems, the period during which civilizations must transmit and communicate is necessarily long, even unlimited. On the other hand, since our present development covers only a negligible fraction of this [communication phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_communication \"Interstellar communication\"), Kardashev hypothesized the high improbability that we will meet \"brothers in intelligence\" who are at the same stage of evolution as are we. After all, highly advanced civilizations know and use the [laws of physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law \"Scientific law\") to a degree that we have yet to suspect. Kardashev asserted that \"this last point should be taken into account in the research programs of extraterrestrial civilizations\" and concluded that it is very likely that our present state is only one of the stages through which every civilization passes during its evolution.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1980-4)\n\n#### Two strategies for searching for intelligent signals\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Two strategies for searching for intelligent signals\")\\]\n\nKardashev then analyzed various models and hypotheses of the evolution of civilization. Answering the question of the Russian astronomer [Iosif Shklovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iosif_Shklovsky \"Iosif Shklovsky\"), who in an article published in 1977 entitled _Possibility of the Intelligent Life in the Universe Being Unique_ found it strange that the \"shock wave of intelligence\" of a supercivilization had not yet reached the limits of the whole [Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe \"Universe\"), Kardashev put forward two explanatory hypotheses. In the first, he postulated that it would not be useful for a supercivilization to expand the space it occupies in order to maintain its activity, and in the second, it is possible that a civilization, instead of dispersing itself in space, would rather continue its activities of information analysis in order to discover new fundamental laws (such as the exploration of the microcosm, or [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole \"Black hole\") for example).[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1980-4)\n\nHowever, such civilization activities require the use of abundant energy. According to the [laws of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics \"Laws of thermodynamics\"), an important part of this consumed energy must be converted into radiation of a [bolometric magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_magnitude \"Absolute magnitude\") approximately equal to that of the radiation background surrounding the source. The spectral distribution of this intensity must be close to that of a [black body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body \"Black body\"). This would be a possible way to search for extraterrestrial civilizations. Such energy consumption would also require a large amount of solid matter for [stellar engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_engineering \"Stellar engineering\") activities, which Kardashev called \"cosmic miracles\". In short, information about the possible existence of an extraterrestrial civilization would come in the form of [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation \"Electromagnetic radiation\").[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1980-4)\n\nWith regard to the fate of civilizations, Kardashev saw two concepts, from which two strategies for the search for extraterrestrial civilizations can be derived. The first, which he called \"terrestrial [chauvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauvinism \"Chauvinism\")\", is based on the principle that civilizations can only stabilize or perish at a level of development close to ours currently reached. The second, which he called the \"evolutionary concept\", holds that civilizations are capable of reaching higher levels of development than that of contemporary humanity. In the first case, the best search strategy using astronomical detection means (e.g., the [SETI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence \"Search for extraterrestrial intelligence\") program) would be to observe the most powerful (and often the most distant) sources of radiation in space.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1980-4)\n\nThe observer will then be able to determine if they are natural emission sources, and only then can the search focus on objects with weaker radiation. In the second case, he recommended to search for new and powerful sources of radiation, especially in the poorly known regions of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum \"Electromagnetic spectrum\"). These sources could be significant or periodic [monochromatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochromatic_radiation \"Monochromatic radiation\") signals from the [galactic center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Center \"Galactic Center\"), from other galaxies or from [quasars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar \"Quasar\") and other exotic cosmic objects.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1980-4)\n\nKardashev believed that the search should focus on the [millimeter wavelength spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submillimetre_astronomy \"Submillimetre astronomy\"), close to the maximum intensity of the [cosmic microwave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background \"Cosmic microwave background\"), rather than in the [21-centimeter band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_line \"Hydrogen line\") (which is the domain of investigation of the SETI program). According to Kardashev, in order to capture the significant radiation of an advanced civilization emitted by a [megastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megastructure \"Megastructure\") (such as a [Dyson sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere \"Dyson sphere\")), a radio telescope with a diameter larger than that of the Earth would have to be placed in orbital space.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1980-4)\n\nKardashev concluded by predicting that the search for extraterrestrial civilizations would lead to positive results in the \\[then\\] next decade, giving humanity access to a vast amount of information about the [Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe \"Universe\") and its evolution over a period of several billion years.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1980-4)\n\n### Third publication (1985)\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Third publication (1985)\")\\]\n\n#### Discovering supercivilizations\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Discovering supercivilizations\")\\]\n\nIn the article _On the Inevitability and the Possible Structure of Supercivilizations_ published in 1985, Kardashev evokes the possible scenarios and the means of investigation available to humanity for the detection of [hypothetical extraterrestrial supercivilizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_hypothesis \"Extraterrestrial hypothesis\"). The Soviet astronomer reminds us that we search for these supercivilizations on the basis of our own development criteria, and that predictions are possible only for extraterrestrial worlds close to our technological level, the others being beyond our intellectual representation. Nevertheless, it seems useful to him to conceive models of supercivilizations based at the same time on imagination and on our present scientific knowledge. Since the [laws of physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law \"Scientific law\") are immutable, even if new laws are discovered in the future, they will not abolish those already known.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev1985-5)\n\nAccording to Kardashev, theoretical models of supercivilizations must meet two basic assumptions. The first is that the range of supercivilization activities that obey the laws of physics is limited only by natural and scientific constraints, while the second is that the evolution of supercivilization activities cannot be interrupted or limited by intrinsic, inherent contingencies, such as large-scale social conflicts. For Kardashev, unlike other scientists, supercivilizations cannot self-destruct or retrogress. According to these principles, there must exist in space [megastructures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megastructure \"Megastructure\") of great size, emitting a lot of [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy \"Energy\") and [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information \"Information\"), and existing for billions of years, while being compact enough to rapidly exchange large amounts of data between them.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev1985-5)[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1997-6)\n\nA supercivilization would thus create a technological structure of cosmic dimensions. As an example, Kardashev cites [Freeman Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson \"Freeman Dyson\")'s megastructure, in the form of a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere \"Dyson sphere\") of several [astronomical units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit \"Astronomical unit\") in diameter. Other phenomena may indicate highly technological activities, such as artificially exploding stars or the changing of stellar [orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit \"Orbit\") to store mass and energy. [Giant molecular clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloud \"Molecular cloud\") also hold great potential for [astroengineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_engineering \"Astronomical engineering\"). Kardashev even raises the possibility of a supercivilization reshaping the entire galaxy.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev1985-5)[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1997-6)\n\nThen he evokes the theoretical and mathematical possibility of the existence of a megastructure in the form of a disk rotating on itself at a constant [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_frequency \"Angular frequency\"). According to him, the search for intelligent signals should be directed to the detection of such megastructures at the characteristic radiation (20 μm). [Quasars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar \"Quasar\") or galactic centers can be excellent candidates to testify to the existence of a supercivilization since they emit strong [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared \"Infrared\") radiation, which indicates a solid structure. The astronomer advises to look for these objects in a [wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength \"Wavelength\") range from a few microns to a few millimeters. Large intelligent structures can also be detected by the fact that they screen or reflect the surrounding radiation.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev1985-5)\n\n#### Possible scenarios for the evolution of supercivilizations\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Possible scenarios for the evolution of supercivilizations\")\\]\n\nSee also: [Potential cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_cultural_impact_of_extraterrestrial_contact \"Potential cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact\")\n\nKardashev believes that it is very likely that a supercivilization has already detected and observed humanity through cosmic-sized telescopes. He discusses this in a 1997 article on the subject, entitled _Radioastron – a Radio Telescope Much Greater than the Earth_.[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1997-2-12) For this supercivilization, the science of \"cosmic ethnography\" must be highly developed. However, the fact that [no contact has been made so far](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox \"Fermi paradox\") could be explained by [ethical considerations of these civilizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_hypothesis \"Zoo hypothesis\"). Based on this principle, Kardashev sees only two possible evolutionary scenarios for a supercivilization: natural evolution and [evolution after contact with other extraterrestrial civilizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_cultural_impact_of_extraterrestrial_contact \"Potential cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact\"). He considers more likely the scenario based on contact between two highly developed, technologically and culturally advanced civilizations; this scenario, which he calls the \"Urbanization Hypothesis\", would result in the regrouping and unification of several civilizations within a few compact regions of the [Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe \"Universe\").[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev1985-5)\n\nKardashev lists, in the form of investigative tools, six possible scenarios (summarized in a table at the end of his 1997 article)[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1997-2-12) that explain the evolution of a civilization. Each of the scenarios corresponds to a [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability \"Probability\"), one or more objects to be observed, an adapted procedure, and, finally the possible consequences for our civilization:[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev1985-5)\n\n1. The scenario of a large unification of civilizations over an extent of one to ten billion light-years with concentration in a certain region has a probability of 60%. These civilizations are to be searched for in the most powerful [quasars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar \"Quasar\") and in the [galactic bulge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_bulge \"Galactic bulge\"), at a radiation level higher than 1038 watts, in the wavelengths from 10 μm to 1 cm, as well as in the other regions of the spectrum. This is to detect megastructures or signals with a wavelength of 1.5 mm[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-13) and omnidirectional emission up to 21 cm. In the event of contact, humanity would see progress in all areas of society in order to join this supercivilization; it is also expected that an [ethnographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnography \"Ethnography\") conservatory would be created on Earth.\n2. The scenario of a unification on the scale of the [galactic cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_cluster \"Open cluster\") has only a 20% probability of realization. Kardashev advises to observe the [Virgo cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_Cluster \"Virgo Cluster\") (especially [M87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87 \"Messier 87\")) and other clusters in a similar way as in the first scenario. The consequences for humanity are the same as in the first scenario.\n3. The scenario of a unification on the scale of galaxies has only a 10% probability. To confirm it, we must study the galactic centers, both of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way \"Milky Way\") and of neighboring galaxies (such as [M31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy \"Andromeda Galaxy\"), [M33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulum_Galaxy \"Triangulum Galaxy\")), according to a procedure similar to that of the first scenario. The consequences for humanity are the same as in the first scenario.\n4. The scenario of a complete [colonization of space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_colonization \"Space colonization\") has no probability of being realized according to Kardashev because if it were realizable then \"they\" would already be on Earth; yet this is not the case. However, in the case of a contact, the consequences on humanity are the same as in the first scenario.\n5. This scenario assumes that all civilizations would have destroyed themselves before any contact. Kardashev estimates the probability of this to be 10%. Humanity should be able to detect ancient megastructures in the vicinity of the [nearest stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_stars_and_brown_dwarfs \"List of nearest stars and brown dwarfs\"). As a result, no contact with humanity can take place.\n6. The last scenario suggests that we are the first or the only ones in the Universe. Kardashev estimates its probability at 10%. Only [exobiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrobiology \"Astrobiology\") can confirm or falsify such a scenario. We can imagine a potential [contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_contact_(science_fiction) \"First contact (science fiction)\") in the distant future, and then the consequences would be similar to those of the other five scenarios.\n\n### Fourth publication (1997)\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Fourth publication (1997)\")\\]\n\n[![Color illustration. An object resembling a truncated trumpet has white spots on its surface.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/CMB_Timeline75.jpg/1000px-CMB_Timeline75.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CMB_Timeline75.jpg) According to the [standard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model \"Standard Model\") describing the [expansion of the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe \"Expansion of the universe\") since the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang \"Big Bang\"), there may be planets older than the Earth, capable of harboring supercivilizations.\n\nIn the article _Cosmology and Civilizations_ published in 1997, Kardashev reiterates the need to carefully observe astronomical objects with strong radiation in order to detect supercivilizations. However, the discovery of a civilization at a stage of development similar to ours is unlikely. The existence of such supercivilizations is made possible by the fact that [life on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_life \"History of life\") is recent compared to the [age of the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe \"Age of the universe\") (8 × 109 years before the [formation of the Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System \"Formation and evolution of the Solar System\")). He then examines the conditions for the appearance of life on cosmological time scales. Assuming the rate of evolution of life on Earth and considering the age of the Universe, it is reasonable to assume that a civilization could have reached our level of technological development in 6 × 109 years. Such civilizations can be observed in nearby regions, since the farther away we observe, the younger the objects are. Recent discoveries of [sources of intense radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray \"Gamma ray\") deadly to life show that life could have flourished under cover for the time necessary for its appearance and maintenance. Another argument for the possibility of a very old supercivilization is that most of the objects that could be megastructures have not yet been discovered and mapped. In addition, 95% of the [matter remains invisible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter \"Dark matter\") or can only be inferred by the gravitational influence it produces.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1997-6)\n\nAccording to Kardashev, it is essential to focus our search tools on new objects radiating at a wavelength of a few microns to a few millimeters, and at a temperature of 3 to 300 [K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin \"Kelvin\"), which is characteristic of large structures of solid matter.[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-14) It would then be possible to detect structures belonging to Type II in our galaxy or in those nearby. Type III structures can also be observed at large cosmological distances. Kardashev recalls that a study was conducted on 3000 sources of the [IRAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRAS \"IRAS\") catalog from the four directions of the sky. Two temperature bands were targeted: from 110 to 120 K and from 280 to 290 K. The analysis showed that the 110–120 K sources are clustered in the [Galactic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_plane \"Galactic plane\") and in its center. Kardashev explains that only more powerful observations in the [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared \"Infrared\") and [submillimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submillimetre_astronomy \"Submillimetre astronomy\") range can reveal possible artificial sources of radiation. He then refers to projects that he has proposed, in particular that of putting into orbit a [cryogenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenics \"Cryogenics\") [space telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_telescope \"Space telescope\") (the _Millimetron Project_).[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1997-6)[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-15)\n\nAccording to Kardashev, these results, combined with those of other research on the age of certain cosmic objects, suggest that civilizations dating from 6 to 8 billion years ago may exist in our galaxy. It is likely that they have long since discovered our own civilization, a hypothesis that could answer the question posed by [Enrico Fermi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi \"Enrico Fermi\") when he formulated his [paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox \"Fermi paradox\"): \"Where are they?\". Without the discovery of artificial sources, however, Shklovsky's theory that civilizations self-destruct as a result of large-scale social conflicts would be proven. Kardashev mentions another hypothesis that, in his opinion, is capable of explaining the dynamics of the supercivilizations: the \"feedback effect\" (theorized by [Sebastian von Hoerner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_von_Hoerner \"Sebastian von Hoerner\") in 1975),[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-16) which is based on the [hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis \"Hypothesis\") that at a high technological level, civilizations tend to converge rather than to isolate themselves. The distance between supercivilizations could then be determined by half the time of the technological evolution of the oldest civilization, which would be about 3 to 4 billion years. On the other hand, this supercivilization may not have been present in our galaxy for a long time. Kardashev concludes by saying that since the [expansion of the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe \"Expansion of the universe\") is infinite, the number and lifetime of such supercivilizations are also infinite.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1997-6)\n\n## Categories defined by Kardashev\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Categories defined by Kardashev\")\\]\n\nThe hypothetical classification, known as the Kardashev scale, distinguishes three stages in the evolution of civilizations according to the dual criteria of access and [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy \"Energy\") consumption.[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Darling-17)[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Calissendorff-2013-18) The purpose of this classification is to guide the search for extraterrestrial civilizations, particularly within [SETI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence \"Search for extraterrestrial intelligence\"), in which Kardashev participated,[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Zoltan_Gal%C3%A1ntai-19) and this on the assumption that a fraction of the energy used by each type is intended for communication with other civilizations. To make this scale more understandable, Lemarchand compares the speed at which a volume of information equivalent to 100,000 average-sized books can be transmitted across the galaxy. A Type II civilization can send this data using a transmission beam that lasts for only 100 seconds. A similar amount of information can be sent across [intergalactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm%E2%80%93hot_intergalactic_medium \"Warm–hot intergalactic medium\") distances of about ten million light years, with a transmission time of several weeks. A Type III civilization can send the same amount of data to the entire [observable universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe \"Observable universe\") with a transmission time of 3 seconds.[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Darling-17)[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Lemarchand-20002-20)\n\nKardashev's classification is based on the assumption of a growth rate of 1% per year. Kardashev believed that it would take humanity 3,200 years to reach Type II, and 5,800 years to reach Type III.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kaku-2007-2) However, Dr. [Michio Kaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku \"Michio Kaku\") believes that humanity must increase its energy consumption by 3% per year to reach Type I in 100–200 years.[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-21) These types are thus separated from each other by a growth rate of several billion.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kaku-2007-2)\n\n### Type I\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section: Type I\")\\]\n\nA civilization \"close to the level currently achieved on Earth, with an energy consumption of ≈4×1019 [erg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erg \"Erg\")/sec\" (4×1012 watts).[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1964-1) A Type I civilization is usually defined as one that can harness all the energy that reaches its home planet from its parent star (for Earth, this value is about 2×1017 watts), which is about four [orders of magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude \"Order of magnitude\") higher than the amount currently achieved on Earth, with an energy consumption of ≈2×1013 watts by 2020. The astronomer Guillermo A. Lemarchand defined Type I as a level close to today's terrestrial civilization, with an energy capacity equivalent to Earth's [solar irradiance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance \"Solar irradiance\"), between 1016 and 1017 watts.[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Lemarchand-22)\n\n### Type II\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit section: Type II\")\\]\n\nA civilization capable of harnessing the energy radiated by its own large star – for example, by successfully completing a [Dyson sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere \"Dyson sphere\") or [Matrioshka brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain \"Matrioshka brain\") – with an energy consumption of ≈4×1033 erg/sec.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1964-1) Lemarchand defined such civilizations as being able to harness and channel the entire radiation output of their star. The energy consumption would then be comparable to the luminosity of the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun \"Sun\"), about 4×1033 erg/sec (4×1026 [watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt \"Watt\")).[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Lemarchand-22)\n\n### Type III\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: Type III\")\\]\n\nA civilization with energy on the scale of its own [galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy \"Galaxy\"), with an energy consumption of ≈4×1044 erg/sec.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1964-1) Lemarchand defined civilizations of this type as having access to energy comparable to the luminosity of the entire [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way \"Milky Way\") galaxy, about 4×1044 erg/sec (4×1037 watts).[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Lemarchand-22)\n\nIn accordance with the data available at the time, Kardashev did not go beyond a Type III civilization. However, new types (0, IV, V, and VI) have been proposed.\n\n## Reassessments of the Kardashev scale\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit section: Reassessments of the Kardashev scale\")\\]\n\n### Sagan's finer classification\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit section: Sagan's finer classification\")\\]\n\nIn 1973, [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan \"Carl Sagan\") discovered Kardashev's work on the classification of civilizations.[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Galantai-2006-23) He found that the differences between the types Kardashev identified were so great that they did not allow for the best possible modeling of the evolution of civilizations.[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Gal%C3%A1ntai-2003-10) Consequently, Sagan proposes a more refined classification, still based on Kardashev's types, but integrating intermediate levels using the following [logarithmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale \"Logarithmic scale\") [interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation \"Interpolation\") formula:[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Carrigan_Jr.-20102-24)\n\nK=log10⁡W−610{\\\\displaystyle K={\\\\frac {\\\\log \\_{10}{W}-6}{10}}}![{\\displaystyle K={\\frac {\\log _{10}{W}-6}{10}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f175300fc34428548abfe2dc18a30771bdabe9f3),\n\nwhere _K_ is the Kardashev type of a civilization and _W_ is the amount of power it uses, in watts. Thus, a _Type 1.1_ civilization would be defined by a power of 1017 watts, while a _Type 2.3_ civilization would be able to harness 1029 watts.\n\nMoreover, the above formula could be used to extrapolate beyond Kardashev's original types. For example, a _**Type 0**_ civilization, not defined by Kardashev, would control about 1 MW of power (equivalent to having around 100 campfires burning at any given time); on Earth, the emergence of Type 0 civilizations is roughly concurrent with the [rise of civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_civilization#Rise_of_civilization \"Cradle of civilization\") in a general sense.[\\[25\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-25)\n\nSagan estimated that, according to this revised scale, 1970s humanity would be Type 0.7 (about 10 [terawatts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terawatts \"Terawatts\")),[\\[26\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Sagan-19732-26) equivalent to 0.16% of the power available on Earth.[\\[27\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Wilson-20112-27) This level is characterized, according to him, by the ability to self-destruct, which he calls \"technological adolescence\".[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Lemarchand-20002-20) In 2021, the total [world energy consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_supply_and_consumption \"World energy supply and consumption\") was 595.15 [exajoules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule#Exajoule \"Joule\") (165,319 [TWh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour#Watt-hour_multiples \"Kilowatt-hour\")),[\\[28\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-28) equivalent to an average power consumption of 18.87 TW or a Kardashev rating of 0.73.[\\[note 1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Sagan2sf-29)[\\[29\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-30)\n\nSagan also suggests that, for completeness, an alphabetical scale should be added to indicate the level of [social development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change \"Social change\"), expressed in the amount of information available to the civilization. Thus, a Class A civilization would be based on 106 [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit \"Bit\") of information (less than any recorded human culture), a Class B on 107, a Class C on 108, and so on. Humanity in 1973 would belong to the \"0.7 H\" class.[\\[30\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-books.google.com-31) According to Sagan, the first civilization with which humanity would come into contact could be between \"1.5 J\" and \"1.8 K\"; a galactic supercivilization would be at the \"3 Q\" stage, while a federation of galaxies could be at the \"4 Z\" stage.[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Lemarchand-20002-20) The information and energy axes are not strictly interdependent, so even a level Z civilization would not have to be Kardashev Type III.[\\[30\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-books.google.com-31) Sagan believed that no civilization had yet reached level Z, speculating that so much unique information would exceed that of all the intelligent species in a [galactic supercluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_supercluster \"Galactic supercluster\"), and observing that the universe is not old enough to exchange information effectively over large distances.\n\nIn 2017, the total amount of information generated on the [internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet \"Internet\") was [26 zettabytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettabyte_Era \"Zettabyte Era\") (with an estimated 120 zettabytes in 2023),[\\[31\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-32) equivalent to 0.73 R/S on Sagan's combined scale.[\\[note 1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Sagan2sf-29)\n\n### Kaku and the knowledge economy\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit section: Kaku and the knowledge economy\")\\]\n\nIn _[Physics of the Future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_of_the_Future \"Physics of the Future\")_ (2011), American physicist [Michio Kaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku \"Michio Kaku\") examines the conditions for humanity to converge on a Type I planetary civilization. This convergence is based primarily on the [knowledge economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_economy \"Knowledge economy\"). Kaku uses the Kardashev scale, but develops it by adding an additional stage: a Type IV civilization would be able to draw the energy it needs from [extragalactic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extragalactic_cosmic_ray \"Extragalactic cosmic ray\"). By studying the evolution of technologies that have changed history ( [paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper \"Paper\"), the [integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit \"Integrated circuit\")), Kaku believes that humanity is moving toward a civilization of planetary dimensions, the \"starting point\" of which is the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet \"Internet\").[\\[32\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Hamish-2012-33)\n\nA Type I civilization consumes [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics) \"Power (physics)\") on the order of thousands to millions of times our current planetary output, about 100 trillion trillion watts. It would have enough energy to manipulate the occurrence of certain natural phenomena, such as [earthquakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake \"Earthquake\") or [volcanoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano \"Volcano\"), and could build cities on the [oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean \"Ocean\"). We can see the beginnings of a Type I civilization in the fact that a global language is developing ( [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language \"English language\")), a global communication system is emerging (the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet \"Internet\")), a global economic system is in the making (the establishment of the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union \"European Union\")), and even a globalized culture is standardizing humanity ( [mass media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media \"Mass media\"), [television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television \"Television\"), [rock music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music \"Rock music\"), and [Hollywood movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States \"Cinema of the United States\")).[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kaku-2007-2) To achieve Type I, humanity must be able to communicate with the rest of the world and to focus on several areas: building [infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure \"Infrastructure\") to facilitate communication and cooperation, [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education \"Education\"), [research and development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development \"Research and development\"), and [innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation \"Innovation\"), as well as building strong ties between [diasporas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora \"Diaspora\") and their countries of origin, and between migrants and non-migrants.[\\[32\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Hamish-2012-33) If development fails, it is likely that the world will not be able to achieve Type II. If these areas do not develop, Kaku predicts that humanity will sink into the \"abyss\":[\\[32\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Hamish-2012-33) an advanced civilization must grow faster than the frequency of occurrence of [extinction-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction-level_threat \"Extinction-level threat\") cosmic catastrophes, such as [comet or asteroid impacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event \"Impact event\"). A Type I civilization should also be able to master [space travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight \"Spaceflight\") to deflect threatening objects. It would also have to anticipate the onset of [ice ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age \"Ice age\") and modify the climate long before they occur to avoid them.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kaku-2007-2)\n\nIn addition, in his books _[Hyperspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace_(book) \"Hyperspace (book)\")_ and _[Parallel Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Worlds_(book) \"Parallel Worlds (book)\")_, Michio Kaku has discussed a Type IV civilization that could harness \"extragalactic\" energy sources such as [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy \"Dark energy\").[\\[33\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-ParallelWorlds-34)\n\n### Zubrin's planet mastery\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit section: Zubrin's planet mastery\")\\]\n\nIn _Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization_, [Robert Zubrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Zubrin \"Robert Zubrin\") suggests another form: his definition of a Type I civilization is described as one that has achieved full mastery of the resources of its planet (global), a Type II of its solar system (interplanetary), and a Type III would have unleashed the full potential of the galaxy (starfaring civilization). Metrics other than pure energy consumption have also been proposed.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Entering_Space-3)\n\nHe ponders the possibility of a Type IV civilization, one that would dominate the universe, noting that there are limits to how minds can connect and interact on a galactic or intergalactic basis. As an example, he mentions that communication from the [Galactic Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Center \"Galactic Center\") of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way \"Milky Way\") galaxy to its edge would take about 50,000 years (since [nothing can travel faster than light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superluminal_communication \"Superluminal communication\"), according to our understanding of physics).[\\[34\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-35)[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Entering_Space-3)\n\n### Barrow's microdimensional mastering\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit section: Barrow's microdimensional mastering\")\\]\n\nThe astronomer [John D.

These Type IV, V, or even VI civilizations would be able to manipulate cosmic structures (galaxies, galactic clusters, superclusters) and even escape the [Big Crunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Crunch \"Big Crunch\") through holes in space.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kaku-2007-2)\n\nBarrow also proposes an \"anti-Kardashev scale\": he observes that humans have found it more cost effective to extend their ability to manipulate their environment to smaller and smaller scales rather than to larger and larger ones. He, therefore, proposes a reverse classification, from Type I-minus to Type Omega-minus:\n\n- **[Type I-minus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering \"Mechanical engineering\")** is capable of manipulating objects on the scale of itself: building structures, mining, joining and breaking solids;\n- **[Type II-minus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_engineering \"Medical engineering\")** is capable of manipulating [genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene \"Gene\") and altering the development of living things, transplanting or replacing parts of themselves, reading and manipulating their [genetic code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code \"Genetic code\");\n- **[Type III-minus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_engineering \"Molecular engineering\")** is capable of manipulating [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule \"Molecule\") and [molecular bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond \"Covalent bond\"), creating new materials;\n- **[Type IV-minus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology \"Nanotechnology\")** is capable of manipulating individual [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom \"Atom\"), creating nanotechnology at the atomic level, and creating complex forms of [artificial life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life \"Artificial life\");\n- **[Type V-minus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_engineering \"Nuclear engineering\")** is capable of manipulating the [atomic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus \"Atomic nucleus\") and engineering the [nucleons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleon \"Nucleon\") that compose it;\n- **[Type VI-minus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtotechnology \"Femtotechnology\")** is capable of manipulating the most elementary particles of matter ( [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark \"Quark\") and [leptons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton \"Lepton\")) to create organized complexity among populations of elementary particles;\n- **Type Omega-minus** is capable of manipulating the fundamental structure of [space and time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime \"Spacetime\").[\\[35\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Impossibility:_Limits_of_Science_and_the_Science_of_Limits-36)\n\n_In Impossibility: The Limits of Science and the Science of Limits_ (1998), Barrow proposes a scale ranging from \"BI\" to \"BVI\", with an ultimate stage he calls \"BΩ\", the former characterized by the possibility of manipulating one's environment, while the latter allows for the modification of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime \"Spacetime\").[\\[36\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-37)\n\n### Galántai's miniaturization and resilience to catastrophes\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit section: Galántai's miniaturization and resilience to catastrophes\")\\]\n\n[![Color illustration.

The hypothesis of Donald Tarter, researcher at SETI, is that a civilization based on [nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology \"Nanotechnology\") would not need an ever-increasing amount of energy. A Type I civilization that masters local space travel could colonize its planetary system and even the [Oort cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud \"Oort cloud\") without needing an amount of energy that would make it Type II.[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Galantai-2006-23) This scale loses its meaning beyond Type II, since it is impossible to predict the evolution of civilizations over long distances in a galactic colonization process. Finally, the Kardashev scale is the product of an era of insufficient scientific knowledge, which considered the possibility of stellar object [CTA-102](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTA-102 \"CTA-102\") as an artificial Type III source, whereas today we know that it is a [galactic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus \"Active galactic nucleus\").[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Galantai-2006-23)\n\nIn another article, Zoltan Galántai suggests considering another scale, no longer based on energy consumption, but on a civilization's ability to survive natural and cosmic disasters. Type I would describe a civilization capable of surviving a local natural disaster, like the [Anasazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestral_Puebloans \"Ancestral Puebloans\"). A Type II civilization would have the means to withstand a regional or continental disaster, and finally Type III could face a global disaster such as an [asteroid's impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event \"Impact event\"), a [supervolcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervolcano \"Supervolcano\")'s eruption, or an [ice age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age \"Ice age\"). Beyond the first three types are civilizations that have scattered throughout the galaxy. The Type IV civilization would still be vulnerable to some cosmic threats, while the Type V civilization would be technically immortal, as no cosmic catastrophe could reach it.[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Galantai-2006-23) The Kardashev scale can be a relevant tool for preventing catastrophes, whether human or natural, according to Richard Wilson, who relates this scale to the power of destruction, in [TNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT \"TNT\"). A Type I civilization would use 25 [megatons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent \"TNT equivalent\") of equivalent TNT per second, a Type II civilization 4 × 109 times more (4 billion hydrogen bombs per second), while a Type III civilization would use 1011 times more.[\\[27\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Wilson-20112-27)\n\n## Progression through the types\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit section: Progression through the types\")\\]\n\nFurther information: [World energy supply and consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_supply_and_consumption \"World energy supply and consumption\")\n\n### Towards type I\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=21 \"Edit section: Towards type I\")\\]\n\nAccording to Carl Sagan, Type I should be reached around 2100.[\\[32\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Hamish-2012-33)\n\nPhysicist and futurist [Michio Kaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku \"Michio Kaku\") has suggested that, if humans increase their energy consumption at an average rate of 3 percent per year, they could reach Type I status in 100–200 years, Type II status in a few thousand years, and Type III status in 100,000 to a million years.[\\[37\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Interstellar_Travel-38)\n\nPhysicist [Freeman Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson \"Freeman Dyson\") has calculated that Type I should be reached in about 200 years,[\\[38\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-:05-39) while Richard Carrigan has estimated that the Earth is just four-tenths of the way to Type I on the Sagan scale. If Type I is reached soon (in the year 3000 for [Richard Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wilson_(physicist) \"Richard Wilson (physicist)\")),[\\[39\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Wilson-2010-40) it would be accompanied by profound social upheavals, but also by a significant risk of self-destruction.[\\[39\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Wilson-2010-40)\n\nAccording to Per Calissendorff, energy consumption cannot be the main parameter to explain the transition from one type to another. Civilizations must have the means to maintain their growth rate despite climatic conditions and major natural disasters, even on the cosmic scale. A civilization moving towards Type II must have mastered [space travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight \"Spaceflight\"), [interplanetary communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_communications \"Interplanetary communications\"), [stellar engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_engineering \"Stellar engineering\"), and [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_engineering \"Climate engineering\"). It must also have developed a planetary communication system, such as the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet \"Internet\").[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Calissendorff-2013-18) For Michio Kaku, the only serious threat to a Type II civilization would be the explosion of a nearby [supernova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova \"Supernova\"), while no known cosmic catastrophe would be capable of wiping out a Type III civilization.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kaku-2007-2)\n\nAccording to [Philip T. Metzger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_T._Metzger \"Philip T. Metzger\"), humanity has reached Type I, but faces an energy challenge. In his 2011 paper _Nature's Way of Making Audacious Space Projects Viable_, he states that the Earth's [non-renewable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-renewable_resource \"Non-renewable resource\") energy sources are nearly exhausted; [natural gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas \"Natural gas\") will be depleted by 2020–2030, [coal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal \"Coal\") by 2035, [uranium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium \"Uranium\") by 2056, while [oil production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraction_of_petroleum \"Extraction of petroleum\") peaked in 2006–2008.[\\[40\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Metzger-2011-41) [Nuclear energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power \"Nuclear power\") cannot fully meet the world's energy needs (it represented only 6% in 2011). In addition, renewable energy cannot meet the growing demand for energy. Most of the minerals used by humans are in danger of becoming scarce; 11 minerals are already classified as having passed their peak production. For Metzger, humanity must therefore undertake a \"100-year project\" aimed at building a spacecraft (\"100 Year Starship\") capable of accessing the vast energy resources of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System \"Solar System\").[\\[40\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Metzger-2011-41) For Metzger, it is even probable that if extraterrestrials coveted the energy resources of our Solar System, they would not look for them on Earth, but on the various [asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid \"Asteroid\") and [planetoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_planet \"Minor planet\"). [Robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics \"Robotics\") is the only way to access so many dispersed resources, and humanity should embark on a second long-term project, which Metzger calls the \"robotsphere\", that would begin with the energetic exploitation of the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon \"Moon\") (estimated at 2.3 × 1013 [J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule \"Joule\")/year). This first step would make it possible to reach Type II in 53 years. Then the robotsphere ( [self-replicating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_machine \"Self-replicating machine\") and [self-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning \"Machine learning\") automated probes) would extend to the rest of the Solar System. Current advances in [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial intelligence\") suggest that the foundations of a robotsphere could be reached early in the next century, beginning in 2100. Metzger sees eight benefits for humanity in building the 100 Year Starship, including zero launch costs because the spacecraft will be built in space by robots that can do so with little human assistance (drastically reducing manufacturing costs), the creation of a Solar System-wide economy, and the use of resources from celestial objects and possibly [terraforming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraforming \"Terraforming\") them.[\\[40\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Metzger-2011-41)\n\n### Towards type II\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=22 \"Edit section: Towards type II\")\\]\n\n[Viorel Badescu](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viorel_Badescu&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Viorel Badescu (page does not exist)\") \\[ [ro](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihail_Viorel_B%C4%83descu \"ro:Mihail Viorel Bădescu\")\\] and [Richard Cathcart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cathcart \"Richard Cathcart\") have studied the possibility that a Type II civilization could use a 450 million kilometer device to direct [solar radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance \"Solar irradiance\") and thus be able to impart a kinetic motion to its star that deviates it from its usual trajectory by about 35 to 40 [parsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec \"Parsec\"),[\\[41\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Badescu-2006-42) allowing it, among other things, to capture its [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy \"Energy\") and navigate the galaxy.[\\[42\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-43)[\\[41\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Badescu-2006-42)\n\nFor Claude Semay, \"a Type II civilization could be detected at great distances (by what is called \"astro-technical leakage\"),\\[ _[verification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_\\] provided that it is not located in a region of the galaxy that is too distant from us, or that it does not occupy a location that is obscured from us by clouds of gas or dust\".[\\[43\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Semay-1998-44)\n\n### Towards type III\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=23 \"Edit section: Towards type III\")\\]\n\n[![Color illustration. A yellow-orange disc in the center is pierced vertically by a spiral of filaments.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Gb1508_illustration.jpg/500px-Gb1508_illustration.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gb1508_illustration.jpg) Artist's view of [quasar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar \"Quasar\") GB1508. According to Russian astronomer Kardashev, a highly evolved civilization, known as \"Type III\" in his theoretical classification, would be able to draw its energy from such a source.\n\nA Type III civilization should be detectable because of the large amount of radiation captured on a galaxy-wide scale. Calissendorff suggests using 75% of the total light emitted by a galaxy to determine that a Type III civilization uses many [Dyson spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere \"Dyson sphere\"). If only three or four of these spheres occupy the galaxy, it does not necessarily mean that the civilization has reached Type III, and it may still be in transition;[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Calissendorff-2013-18) however, such civilizations may remain beyond the reach of our understanding and instruments. Sagan believes that the nearest Type III civilization is at an average distance of 10,000 light-years from us, but that it is not interested in classical radio transmissions, being of a different technological level. Only small, low-level civilizations could communicate with us.[\\[26\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Sagan-19732-26)\n\nSemay observes that \"a Type III civilization should not be confused with what science fiction writers call a ' [galactic empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_empire \"Galactic empire\")'\", knowing that it can only exist if [interstellar travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_travel \"Interstellar travel\") is achieved. Semay argues that there is no evidence that this will ever be possible.[\\[43\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Semay-1998-44) Based on Dyson's calculations, Semay believes that such a journey would take three centuries, with an average distance between stars of about 7 light years. Overall, the speed of the colonization front, which ranges from 4 × 10−4 to 5 × 10−3 light-years per year, would result in humanity spreading throughout the galaxy in a period of 16 to 200 million years.[\\[43\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Semay-1998-44) \"A Type III civilization, having thus \"domesticated\" its galaxy by building a large number of Dyson spheres, would be detectable over intergalactic distances of several million light-years.\"[\\[43\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Semay-1998-44)\n\nA Type III civilization could theoretically live inside a [supermassive black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole \"Supermassive black hole\"), in a stable periodic orbit, which would make it completely undetectable, according to V. I. Dokuchaev.[\\[44\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-45)\n\n### Towards type IV\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=24 \"Edit section: Towards type IV\")\\]\n\nZoltan Galántai notes that neither Kardashev nor Sagan thought to extend the scale and define a Type IV (which would use the energy of an entire Universe). They simply did not envision a civilization capable of manipulating its environment on the largest possible scale (about 14 billion [parsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec \"Parsec\")).[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Gal%C3%A1ntai-2003-10) The concept of a Type IV supercivilization approaches divine possibilities, enabling the creation of, and travel through, [alternate universes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse \"Multiverse\") of such a civilization's own design,[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Gal%C3%A1ntai-2003-10) although the latter possibility is reserved for a Type V civilization by Carrigan.[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Carrigan_Jr.-20102-24) The fraction of energy captured by a civilization capable of powering itself on a black hole could also be used to classify civilizations.[\\[45\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Inoue-2011-46)\n\n## Possible scenarios\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=25 \"Edit section: Possible scenarios\")\\]\n\nAccording to Kardashev, the most important parameters to define the existence of a civilization are three: the presence of very powerful energy sources, the use of non-standard technologies, and the transmission of significant amounts of information of various kinds through space.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47)\n\n### Energy sources\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=26 \"Edit section: Energy sources\")\\]\n\nKardashev's classification is based on the hypothesis that an advanced civilization uses significant energy, which implies that it must be de facto detectable over long distances, as summarized by Zoltan Galántai.[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Galantai-2006-23) For Kardashev, the limit of a civilization's energy consumption is originally located in the region of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum \"Electromagnetic spectrum\") from 106 to 108 Hz, which allows two observations related to [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics \"Thermodynamics\"). First, all the energy consumed is inevitably converted into heat. Second, this energy can only be dissipated in the form of radiation scattered in space. These two findings are the pillars of Kardashev's theory that cosmic objects with strong radiation could be artificial sources.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47) He also considered the possibility of detecting an artificial source by emphasizing the [spectral line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line \"Spectral line\") of [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen \"Hydrogen\") in its use for [nuclear fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion \"Nuclear fusion\").[\\[47\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-48)\n\nDutil and Dumas consider several physical limits to continuous energy production, such as [photosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis \"Photosynthesis\") (about 10 [TW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terawatt \"Terawatt\")), climate (about 127 TW), and [solar flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance \"Solar irradiance\") (174,000 TW). The only inexhaustible source of energy that can sustain a civilization for over several billion years, is [deuterium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium \"Deuterium\") (used in [nuclear fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion \"Nuclear fusion\")).[\\[48\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Dutil-2007-49) The sustainability of a civilization must therefore involve \"strict control of the exploitation of available resources\"; this difficulty in exceeding energy limits may explain the fact that the vast majority of civilizations fail to engage in a space colonization project.[\\[48\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Dutil-2007-49)\n\nAstrophysicist Makoto Inoue and economist Hiromitsu Yokoo have explored the possibility that a Type III civilization could extract energy from a [supermassive black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole \"Supermassive black hole\") (SMBH). The captured energy could meet the extraordinary needs of a civilization that requires about 4 × 1044 erg/s.[\\[45\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Inoue-2011-46) The energy would be captured in the form of radiation emitted by the matter rushing into the star, by means of collectors located within the [accretion disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk \"Accretion disk\"). These collectors are similar to Dyson spheres. The overflow, as well as the waste of the civilization, would be redirected towards the black hole. A fraction of this energy, directed as a [high-powered beam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maser \"Maser\"), could be useful for space travel. A galactic club of civilizations could transmit the energy through networks within the galaxy. Within the various central power stations that make up the network, power transmission is periodically switched between transmitter and receiver, according to the galactic rotation. To be efficient, this network should be located at the center of the galaxy.[\\[45\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Inoue-2011-46)\n\n### The technology\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=27 \"Edit section: The technology\")\\]\n\nFurther information: [Stellar engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_engineering \"Stellar engineering\") and [Megastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megastructure \"Megastructure\")\n\nThis parameter is one of the most undetectable in the Universe due to the fact that solid matter structures are at low temperatures and emit weak radiation. Their luminosity, which is difficult to observe, also makes it impossible to observe them with telescopes. Likewise, we cannot detect them by their [gravitational effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity \"Gravity\").[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47) However their existence can be detected by analyzing [wavelengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength \"Wavelength\") between 8 and 13 microns, corresponding to surface temperatures of 300 K. A hypothetical [Dyson sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere \"Dyson sphere\") could thus be detected,[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Carrigan_Jr.-20102-24) provided that the observation is made from space. Locally, the significant dip in luminosity that would result from a giant Dyson sphere (or \"Fermi bubble\") would allow the detection of a Type III civilization.[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Carrigan_Jr.-20102-24)\n\nA [megastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megastructure \"Megastructure\") like a Dyson sphere could be the result of a technology based on [self-replicating probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_machine \"Self-replicating machine\"), as those imagined by [von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann \"John von Neumann\"). A Type III civilization would have the means to disperse a significant number of these spheres throughout the galaxy, which would have the effect of attenuating the light emitted by the galaxy.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Calissendorff-2013-18) Kaku also considers this to be the most efficient method of colonizing space. For example, a galaxy 100,000 light years in diameter would be explored in half a million years.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kaku-2007-2) [Paul Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Davies \"Paul Davies\") has suggested that a civilization could colonize the galaxy by scattering miniature probes, no larger than the palm of a hand, using [nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology \"Nanotechnology\"). This thesis is realistic, he explains, because it is obvious that the technology is becoming increasingly miniaturized and proportionally less expensive.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kaku-2007-2)\n\nType II megastructures would be easier to detect. This would be the case of a [Dyson sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere \"Dyson sphere\") used as a \" [stellar engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_engine \"Stellar engine\")\",[\\[49\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Badescu-50) as well as the contribution of heavy elements.[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Carrigan_Jr.-20102-24) Similarly, \"Shkadov thrusters\", which would produce a lateral thrust of 4.4 [parsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec \"Parsec\") on their star by reflecting solar radiation through a structure made of mirrors, would be observable objects. This device would break the symmetry of solar radiation and counteract [gravitational forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity \"Gravity\"), allowing a Type II civilization to move its home solar system through space.[\\[50\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-51)[\\[49\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Badescu-50) Drake and Shklovski have also considered the possibility of \"seeding\" a star (Stellar salting) by artificially adding extremely rare elements such as [technetium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium \"Technetium\") or [promethium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promethium \"Promethium\"). Such an intervention in a star's composition would be detectable.[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Carrigan_Jr.-20102-24)\n\nIt is still possible that humanity could discover traces of lost Type I, II, or III civilizations. The search for material traces of such civilizations (e.g. Dyson spheres or stellar engines), an \"interesting alternative\" to the conventional SETI program, lays the foundation for a \" [cosmic archaeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoarchaeology \"Xenoarchaeology\")\" according to Richard A. Carrigan. Efforts to detect intelligence markers in the atmospheres of [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet \"Exoplanet\") (such as [freon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freon \"Freon\"), [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen \"Oxygen\"), or even [ozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone \"Ozone\"), residues of biotic activity according to [James Lovelock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lovelock \"James Lovelock\")'s research)[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Carrigan_Jr.-20102-24) are one of the most promising avenues. A civilization watching its star die (as a [red giant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant \"Red giant\"), for example) could have tried to prolong its existence through megastructures that should be detectable.[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Carrigan_Jr.-20102-24) The possible traces could be nuclear remnants, to be sought within the [spectral types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification \"Stellar classification\") going from [A5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-type_main-sequence_star \"A-type main-sequence star\") to [F2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence \"Main sequence\") according to Whitmire and Wright.[\\[51\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-52) It could also be a change in the [isotopic ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_abundance \"Natural abundance\"), due to a stellar engine, or an unusual spectral modulation in the composition of the star.[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Carrigan_Jr.-20102-24)\n\n### The interstellar transmission of information\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=28 \"Edit section: The interstellar transmission of information\")\\]\n\nFurther information: [Interstellar communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_communication \"Interstellar communication\")\n\n[![Color illustration.

On the one hand, there can be an exchange of information between highly developed civilizations or civilizations at similar stages of evolution. On the other hand, the transmission of information can be aimed at raising the level of other less developed civilizations. If supercivilizations do exist, the transmissions of the first type must remain inaccessible to our observation because they must be unidirectional and not be directed toward the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System \"Solar System\"). Conversely, those of the second type must be easily detectable by our listening devices.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47)\n\nA signal of artificial origin should contain more than 10 and less than 100 [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit \"Bit\"). The latter would be of two types: transient and stable. Several criteria allow us to distinguish a signal of artificial origin from others. First, the optimal region of the spectrum to host artificial signals is the one where the temperature of the [cosmic microwave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background \"Cosmic microwave background\") is the lowest.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47) Second, artificial sources must have a minimum angular size. The presence of suspicious data in other regions of the spectrum (such as [circular polarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_polarization \"Circular polarization\"), radio and optical frequencies,[\\[52\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-53) or [X-ray emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_X-ray_source \"Astrophysical X-ray source\")) can confirm that it is an intelligent transmission. Two sources among those studied have parameters close to those expected: 1934-63 and [3C 273B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3C_273 \"3C 273\").[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47)\n\nFor L. M. Gindilis, there are two criteria for a signal to be called artificial: one related to the artificial nature of the source and the other related to a particular radiation, intentionally designed to ensure communication and facilitate detection.[\\[53\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Gindilis-1971-54) Only Type II or III civilizations can communicate using [isotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropy \"Isotropy\") transmissions that allow omnidirectional reception. In a 1 MHz band (which requires about 1024 watts), detection of signals from a Type II civilization is possible up to 1,000 [light-years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year \"Light-year\") away, while signals from a Type III civilization are detectable virtually throughout the [observable Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe \"Observable universe\").[\\[53\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Gindilis-1971-54) However, building an omnidirectional transmitter powerful enough to transmit over a range of 1,000 light years would take several million years. According to V.S. Troitsky, the energy required and the limitations in its production would be two obstacles to completing this project in a reasonable time.[\\[54\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-55)\n\nFor Zoltan Galántai, we would not be able to distinguish between an intelligent extraterrestrial signal and a signal of natural origin. Therefore, he does not believe that Type II, III or even IV civilizations can be detected. Even if humanity reaches Type IV, it will not be able to detect another supercivilization of a similar level, and we will consider their changes in the universe to be the result of natural causes. Thus, there may be many Type IV civilizations in the universe, but none of them will be able to detect the others. Moreover, the dimensions of the universe make these supercivilizations like islands far from the others, which Dyson defines as a \" [Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll \"Lewis Carroll\") Universe\".[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Gal%C3%A1ntai-2003-10)\n\nFor Alexander L. Zaitsev, the radio transmission of interstellar messages (IRM) is the most likely method used by civilizations. Planetary [radio telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_telescope \"Radio telescope\") and those installed on [asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid \"Asteroid\") would make it possible to listen to the many messages that could be sent to us.[\\[55\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-56) In 2007, the [SETI program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence \"Search for extraterrestrial intelligence\") analyzed the only television frequencies sent by a Type 0 civilization, notes [Michio Kaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku \"Michio Kaku\"). Therefore, our galaxy may have communications from Type II and III civilizations, but our listening devices can only detect Type 0 messages.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kaku-2007-2)\n\n## Search and detection of civilizations\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=29 \"Edit section: Search and detection of civilizations\")\\]\n\n### The Byurakan Conference (1964)\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=30 \"Edit section: The Byurakan Conference (1964)\")\\]\n\nFrom 1962, Kardashev was a member of a [SETI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence \"Search for extraterrestrial intelligence\") research group at the [Sternberg Astronomical Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternberg_Astronomical_Institute \"Sternberg Astronomical Institute\") in Moscow. In 1964, he organized the first [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_people \"Soviet people\") conference on the possibility of extraterrestrial civilizations, which was held at the Byurakan astrophysical observatory in [Armenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia \"Armenia\").[\\[56\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Darling-2-57) This national conference was held in response to the American seminar known as the _Green Bank conference_ of 1961, which was held at the [Green Bank observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bank_Observatory \"Green Bank Observatory\") in the United States.[\\[57\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Spangenburg-2004-58) It brought together [radio astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy \"Radio astronomy\") with the aim of \"finding rational technical and linguistic solutions to the problem of communication with an extraterrestrial civilization that is more advanced than the Earth's civilization\". Kardashev presented his classification, while Troitskii announced that it was possible to detect signals from other galaxies.[\\[58\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-59)\n\nFor Kardashev, \"in the next 5 to 10 years, all the sources of radiation with the largest observable flux, in all the regions of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum \"Electromagnetic spectrum\"), will have been discovered and studied\", the sensitivity of the listening devices having indeed reached their technical limits. According to him, the entire electromagnetic spectrum will be known and, consequently, the list of the objects that could be artificial sources could thus be extended. The search for artificial signals will then have to concentrate on objects of maximum [luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity \"Luminosity\") or radiation belonging to a certain region of the spectrum, but also on objects of significant mass, and on those that represent the essence of matter in the Universe. As early as 1971, Kardashev considered that this observation requires the preparation of a plan of listening and analysis, which will allow the success of the search for extraterrestrial civilizations. Humanity will then be able to solve the \" [main dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox \"Fermi paradox\")\", as it was stated by [Enrico Fermi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi \"Enrico Fermi\").[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47) This dilemma is, according to the Soviet astronomer, is certainly connected with our lack of information and knowledge.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47)[\\[59\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-60)\n\nKardashev believes that a research project like [Ozma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Ozma \"Project Ozma\") is incapable of detecting a Type I civilization (an idea also promoted by Kaplan in 1971),[\\[60\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-:0-61) and that SETI should instead focus on searching for intense radio signals that could emanate from active Type II or III civilizations.[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Galantai-2006-23) To prove the effectiveness of this approach, Kardashev therefore turned his attention to two radio sources discovered by the [California Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology \"California Institute of Technology\"), nicknamed CTA-21 and [CTA-102](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTA-102 \"CTA-102\"). Subsequently, Gennadii Borisovich Sholomitskii then used the Russian astronomical research station to study the data from CTA-102.[\\[57\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Spangenburg-2004-58) He found that this [radio source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source \"Astronomical radio source\") is characterized by its variability. Kardashev then considered that this could be an indication of an artificial emission source, albeit of rather short life span.[\\[56\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Darling-2-57)\n\n### Towards a \"physical eschatology\"\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=31 \"Edit section: Towards a \\\"physical eschatology\\\"\")\\]\n\nThe knowledge of these hypothetical supercivilizations must fit into a wide range of [physical laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law \"Scientific law\") that contain the entirety of our current knowledge, since the technical and scientific developments of mankind can be considered as an inevitable and necessary stage in the process of the evolution of a [civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization \"Civilization\"). Based on this principle, Kardashev proposes to define several concepts applicable to extraterrestrial civilizations.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47) The physical laws, which are universal, can be used as a common basis for understanding other civilizations and, in particular, allow us to develop an objective research program.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47) [Michio Kaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku \"Michio Kaku\") also believes that the evolution of civilizations obeys the \"iron laws of physics\" and in particular the [laws of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics \"Laws of thermodynamics\"), those of stable matter ( [baryonic matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon \"Baryon\")) and those of [planetary evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System \"Solar System\") (probability of occurrence of natural or cosmic catastrophes).[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kaku-2007-2) The [anthropic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle \"Anthropic principle\") also makes it possible to predict the sociological characteristics at the basis of any civilization.[\\[61\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-62)\n\nHowever, these universal laws are not the only parameters to consider. Zoltan Galántai explains that \"it is impossible to calculate the future of the Universe over long periods of time without including the effects of life and intelligence\", a position close to that of [Freeman Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson \"Freeman Dyson\").[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Zoltan_Gal%C3%A1ntai-19) Taking into account these two phenomena, the universal physical laws and the [intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence \"Intelligence\") resulting from life, defines a \"physical [eschatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology \"Eschatology\")\", as Galántai puts it. This approach began in the 1970s with the work of Kardashev, and then physical eschatology gradually interested a number of scientists and thinkers, notes Dyson.[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Zoltan_Gal%C3%A1ntai-19)\n\n### A functional definition of civilization\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=32 \"Edit section: A functional definition of civilization\")\\]\n\n[![On a black background, a round luminous glow.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Messier_87_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg/500px-Messier_87_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Messier_87_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg) Galaxy [M87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87 \"Messier 87\") has an [active galactic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus \"Active galactic nucleus\"), providing a strong [source of radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraluminous_X-ray_source \"Ultraluminous X-ray source\") in all [wavelengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength \"Wavelength\"). This type of radiation was considered by Kardashev to be one of the possible signals of an advanced civilization.\n\nObservation of the development of [living organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism \"Organism\") shows that they are characterized by the tendency to store a maximum amount of [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information \"Information\"), both about the environment and about themselves. This information then leads to an abstract analysis, which plays an important role in the development of life forms. Thus, Kardashev defines civilization from a functional perspective as \"a state of very stable matter capable of acquiring, abstractly analyzing and applying information in order to extract data about the environment and itself, in order to develop survival reactions \".[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47) However, this [functional definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism \"Pragmatism\") of civilization implies that it cannot have a [goal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal \"Goal\") or end, since it is based on the principle of accumulating more and more information. Taking up von Hoerner's categories, Kardashev sees four possible scenarios for the development of civilizations:\n\n1. Total destruction of life.\n2. Destruction of only intelligent life.\n3. Degeneration.\n4. Loss of interest.\n\nHowever, he refuses to see these as inevitable ends. But the assumption that the only limit to the development of a civilization can be the existence of a finite amount of information, in all areas, is also false, since it is highly improbable that information in the Universe is infinite.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47) Given these two [hypotheses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis \"Hypothesis\"), Kardashev argues that there is no universal civilization (supercivilization) because highly developed civilizations lose interest in space exploration. In any case, and despite the problem of the end of civilizations, he concludes, in the light of his functional definition of the advanced civilization, that the latter must use mass and energy on fantastic scales. According to him, there is no reason to denounce the hypothesis that the [expansion of the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe \"Expansion of the universe\") would not be an effect of the intelligent activity of a supercivilization.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47)\n\n### Human civilization: a model for extrapolation\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=33 \"Edit section: Human civilization: a model for extrapolation\")\\]\n\nKardashev poses the following question: \"Is it possible to describe the development of a civilization in general terms over large cosmological periods?\" Now many of the fundamental parameters that characterize the development of civilization on Earth are [growing exponentially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth \"Exponential growth\"). In the field of energy, astronomer Don Goldsmith estimated that the Earth receives about one billionth of the Sun's energy, and that humans use about one millionth of it.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kaku-2007-2) So we consume about one millionth of a billionth of the Sun's total energy. Since human expansion is exponential, we can determine how long it will take for humanity to go from Type II to Type III according to [Michio Kaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku \"Michio Kaku\").[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kaku-2007-2)\n\nThus, the rate of development of our own world remains the only criterion for [extrapolating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapolation \"Extrapolation\") the state of civilizations older than humanity.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47) The same is true for social values and basic needs according to Ashkenazi.[\\[62\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-63) Therefore, the time to double technical knowledge is about ten years, and to double energy output, available reserves, and population is about 25 years. Two scenarios are then possible: spatial expansion or energy stagnation, the latter being possible only for 125 years, according to Kardashev, using the following relationship α=1.04{\\\\displaystyle \\\\alpha =1.04}![{\\displaystyle \\alpha =1.04}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b9f4c2fdd1591a967111cdba47fcd484837f58fe):\n\nt=log⁡(P/Po)log⁡α{\\\\displaystyle t={\\\\frac {\\\\log \\\\left(P/P\\_{o}\\\\right)}{\\\\log \\\\alpha }}}![{\\displaystyle t={\\frac {\\log \\left(P/P_{o}\\right)}{\\log \\alpha }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1bdfb01e51e2cd8b1f963bfd596753e6853dd933)\n\nwhere t{\\\\displaystyle t}![{\\displaystyle t}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65658b7b223af9e1acc877d848888ecdb4466560) is the number of years, P{\\\\displaystyle P}![{\\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) is a parameter that increases annually as a function of Po{\\\\displaystyle P\\_{o}}![{\\displaystyle P_{o}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/07d20f5b8e09cda22c3552e1da5bf7c7709057d9) and of t{\\\\displaystyle t}![{\\displaystyle t}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65658b7b223af9e1acc877d848888ecdb4466560) according to P=Poαt{\\\\displaystyle P=P\\_{o}\\\\alpha ^{t}}![{\\displaystyle P=P_{o}\\alpha ^{t}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/567b53a0e93fd9c6f6e645fab317cabdfd25d1ab) and α{\\\\displaystyle \\\\alpha }![{\\displaystyle \\alpha }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3), a growth rate.\n\nIf α=1.04{\\\\displaystyle \\\\alpha =1.04}![{\\displaystyle \\alpha =1.04}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b9f4c2fdd1591a967111cdba47fcd484837f58fe), then humanity's energy consumption will exceed the incident solar power (1.742 × 1017W) after 240 years, the total power of the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun \"Sun\") (3.826 × 1026W) after 800 years, and that of the Galaxy (7.29 × 1036W) after 1,500 years.[\\[note 2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-64)[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47) Based on this calculation, Zuckerman estimates the number of civilizations that could exist in our [galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy \"Galaxy\") at 10,000.[\\[63\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-65) Kardashev concludes that the current exponential growth is a transitional phase in the development of a civilization, and that it is inevitably limited by natural factors. In fact, he believes that the required [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass \"Mass\") and [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy \"Energy\") will continue to grow exponentially for another 1,000 years.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47) Civilization is thus defined by an exponential rate of increase. Humanity as a model for thinking about the development of extraterrestrial civilizations has its limitations, which can be truly overcome by a [multidisciplinary approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity \"Interdisciplinarity\") according to the work of Kathryn Denning.[\\[64\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-66)\n\n### Research conducted\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=34 \"Edit section: Research conducted\")\\]\n\nIn 1963, Nikolai Kardashev and Gennady Borissovich Sholomitskii studied the [CTA 102](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTA-102 \"CTA-102\") [radio source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source \"Astronomical radio source\") on the 920 MHz band from the _Crimea Deep Space Station_, looking for signs of a Type III civilization.[\\[65\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-67) CTA 102 had been discovered by Sholomitskii a year earlier, and Kardashev quickly saw it as a possible artificial source to study in order to validate his classification. The observation lasted until February 1965, and on April 12, Sholomitskii announced to the press (via the Russian [ITAR-TASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS \"TASS\")) that Soviet astronomers had discovered a signal that could be of extraterrestrial origin. On April 14, he gave a conference in Moscow where he repeated his announcement; but by November 1964, two American astronomers had identified CTA 102 as a [quasar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar \"Quasar\"), and their publication definitively closed the \"CTA 102 case\".[\\[66\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-68) It was the study of this source that had led to the Byurakan conference in 1964.[\\[67\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Braude-2012-69)\n\nIn 1975 and 1976, the American astronomers [Frank Drake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Drake \"Frank Drake\") and [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan \"Carl Sagan\") searched at [Arecibo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Telescope \"Arecibo Telescope\") for signs of Type II civilizations in four galaxies of the [Local Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group \"Local Group\"): [M33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulum_Galaxy \"Triangulum Galaxy\"), [M49](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_49 \"Messier 49\"), [Leo I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_(dwarf_galaxy) \"Leo I (dwarf galaxy)\") and [Leo II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_II_(dwarf_galaxy) \"Leo II (dwarf galaxy)\").[\\[68\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Sagan-1976-70)[\\[69\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Freitas-2008-71) The year before, the two men had sent [mankind's first message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message \"Arecibo message\") to [M13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_13 \"Messier 13\").[\\[70\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Dick-2006-72) The results were published as \"The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence\" in _[Scientific American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American \"Scientific American\")_ in May 1975.[\\[71\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Sagan-1975-73)\n\nIn 1976, Kardashev, Troitskii, and Gindilis used the [RATAN-600](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RATAN-600 \"RATAN-600\") radio telescope in the North Caucasus to search for signals from Type II or III civilizations in the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way \"Milky Way\") and other nearby galaxies.[\\[69\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Freitas-2008-71) The radio telescope was built in 1966 under the supervision of Gindilis to listen at centimeter wavelengths.[\\[67\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Braude-2012-69)\n\nIn 1987, [Tarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Tarter \"Jill Tarter\"), Kardashev, and Slysh used the [VLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Array \"Very Large Array\") to detect possible infrared sources near the galactic center from the [IRAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRAS \"IRAS\") telescope catalog. All three were looking for evidence of hypothetical [Dyson spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere \"Dyson sphere\").

Annis suggested that 75% of the least luminous objects (i.e., those with a decrease in absolute magnitude of 1.5 compared to the diagram) could be considered as possible candidates. However, no object with this characteristic is observed in his survey.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Calissendorff-2013-18)[\\[43\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Semay-1998-44) On the other hand, Annis uses the available astronomical data to estimate the probability that a Type III civilization could exist. He shows that the average time that could allow for the emergence of such a civilization is 300 billion years, so none can exist in our present Universe.[\\[74\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-76)\n\nPer Calissendorff conducted a study on a sample of spiral galaxies from two databases: 4,861 from the _Spiral Field I-band_ (SFI++ catalog compiled by Springob et al. in 2005) and 95 from that of Reyes et al. in 2011.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Calissendorff-2013-18) The same procedure was followed as in Annis, but the sample of galaxies used is 80 times larger than that used in the Annis study.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Calissendorff-2013-18) Some sources were classified as \"lopsided\": they appear [asymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry \"Symmetry\") in shape, meaning that one side of the [galactic disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_disc \"Galactic disc\") is more massive and less luminous than the other. This characteristic, according to Calissendorff, could be an indication that the galaxy is home to a civilization that has placed Dyson spheres in its main part. This can be explained by the fact that the colonization starts from one side of the galactic disk, making it appear darker and leading a distant observer to believe that the core has moved to that same side.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Calissendorff-2013-18) On the other hand, a galaxy hosting Dyson spheres should be characterized by a significant source of far- [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared \"Infrared\") radiation.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Calissendorff-2013-18) The fact remains that a Type III civilization can consume energy through a Dyson sphere without surrounding a star. Indeed, such [megastructures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megastructure \"Megastructure\") could also extract energy from a [black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole \"Black hole\"), according to the study by Inoue and Yokoo (2011). However, such a structure would not reduce the luminosity of an observed galaxy.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Calissendorff-2013-18) Calissendorff's study concludes that 11 of the sources analyzed (out of a catalog of 2,411 galaxies, or 0.46%) show possible evidence of a Type III civilization. Searching for objects that obscure 90% of the light leaves only one source remains that meets the criteria.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Calissendorff-2013-18) These positive sources show a low [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift \"Redshift\") (so they are old, about 100 million years), which is consistent with possible Type III civilizations, that could have flourished only in the early past.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Calissendorff-2013-18) To have a better chance of detecting Type III artificial sources, Calissendorff suggests taking several photographs in a row, fast enough to fix the movement of turbulence in the atmosphere, applying different [photometric filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometry_(astronomy) \"Photometry (astronomy)\") and looking for dark areas (the case of a Dyson sphere being assembled by a Type II civilization), or analyzing the infrared spectrum of galaxies. A much larger sample of objects should be studied.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Calissendorff-2013-18)\n\n### Observational evidence\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=35 \"Edit section: Observational evidence\")\\]\n\nIn 2015, a study of galactic mid- [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared \"Infrared\") emissions concluded that \"Kardashev Type III civilizations are either very rare or do not exist in the [local Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe \"Observable universe\")\".[\\[75\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-77)\n\nIn 2016, Paul Gilster, author of the Centauri Dreams website, described a signal apparently coming from the star [HD 164595](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_164595 \"HD 164595\") as requiring the power of a Type I or Type II civilization, if produced by extraterrestrial lifeforms.[\\[76\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-78) In August 2016, however, it was discovered that the origin of the signal was most likely a military satellite orbiting the Earth.[\\[77\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-79)\n\n### Possible listening criteria\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=36 \"Edit section: Possible listening criteria\")\\]\n\n#### Kardashev's point of view\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=37 \"Edit section: Kardashev's point of view\")\\]\n\nAccording to Kardashev, humanity's ignorance of the physical possibilities of communication through space is great.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47) Only a negligible fraction of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum \"Electromagnetic spectrum\") as an existing source of information in the universe is known.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47) Thus, of the 89% of information that humans lack, 42% concerns the range from 109 to 1014 Hz (centimetric, millimetric, submillimetric and infrared waves) and 25% concerns the range from 1015 to 1018 Hz (ultraviolet radiation and X-rays).[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47) Kardashev distinguishes two categories of listening areas: objects emitting in a broad frequency spectrum and objects emitting on the contrary in a narrow [spectral line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line \"Spectral line\"), the second category posing much more theoretical problems than the first, while being central, both for [astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics \"Astrophysics\") and for the search for extraterrestrial civilizations.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47)\n\nDespite advances in astrophysics, the available information is still insufficient to prove the absence of supercivilizations, based on the inability to observe signs of activity. However, because of the possibility that there are [planetary systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_system \"Planetary system\") much older than the Solar System, and considering that cosmic objects such as [quasars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar \"Quasar\") could be products of supercivilization activity, a detailed program of listening and searching for intelligent signs remains valid. This program includes:[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47)\n\n- Monitoring the sky at 3, 10, 30, 100 and 300 microns, especially at 1, 3, and 10 mm, in order to identify one hundred of the most powerful sources among those observed and at each frequency;\n- Study in detail the properties of quasars and other unusual objects;\n- Search for monochromatic anomalies among the most powerful [radio sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source \"Astronomical radio source\") (such as a [hydroxyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxy_group \"Hydroxy group\") emission line), in the decimeter band;\n- Search for periodic signals ( [pulsars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar \"Pulsar\")) of interstellar origin, in the same band;\n- Searches for monochromatic signals of different frequencies, always in the same band.\n\nAccording to Kardashev, only a [radio interferometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometry \"Interferometry\") with a base, either of the order of or larger than the diameter of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth \"Earth\"), placed in orbital space, would allow listening to centimetric and decimetric frequencies.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47) Once a set of unusual sources has been selected, the next step is to look for significant content in the radiations from these objects.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47) In 1998, Nikolai Kardashev, S. F. Likhachev, and V. I. Zhuravlev proposed two [SETI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence \"Search for extraterrestrial intelligence\") space projects to detect artificial sources: the _Millimetron_ project (an orbiting observatory with a 10-meter diameter mirror) and the _VLBI optical telescope_ (for interferometric synthesis of ultraviolet, optical, and infrared images).[\\[78\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-80)\n\n#### Other leads\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=38 \"Edit section: Other leads\")\\]\n\nFor [Samuil Aronovich Kaplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuil_Kaplan \"Samuil Kaplan\"), \"the most reliable criterion\" remains the small [angular diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_diameter \"Angular diameter\") of the radio source. The [wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength \"Wavelength\") of 21 cm, privileged since 1959, according to the study of Cocconi and Morrison, is not the only listening region. Kaplan, in 1971, also mentioned the radio region of the spectrum, characterized by the [hydroxyl radical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl_radical \"Hydroxyl radical\") (OH). For Livio, the means of detection should focus on [globular clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster \"Globular cluster\"), the regions most likely to harbor planets similar to the Earth.[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Carrigan_Jr.-20102-24)\n\nFor Guillermo A. Lemarchand, extraterrestrial civilizations should not use an omnidirectional transmitter. Instead, they should look for signals of weak information, intermittent and unidirectional. They will certainly need to use [interferometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometry \"Interferometry\") to inspect planetary systems where life might appear. From Earth, it would be possible to pick up such signals at distances of up to 35 + (t\\_f - 2000) / 2, where t\\_f is the observation date in years, knowing that t\\_f ≥ 2000.[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Lemarchand-20002-20) However, there are many techniques for transmitting an interstellar message, ranging from [bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson \"Boson\") to [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle \"Particle\") and even [antiparticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparticle \"Antiparticle\").[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Lemarchand-22)\n\nAn artificial source located in the [accretion disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk \"Accretion disk\") of a [supermassive black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole \"Supermassive black hole\") would be undetectable by the beams used to transmit the collected energy. In fact, the probability of detecting a beam of one [micron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre \"Micrometre\") [arc-second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_and_second_of_arc \"Minute and second of arc\") is less than 10−23. Moreover, the energy emitted by the black hole would not allow detection of the energy used by the Type III civilization. On the other hand, the [specular reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection \"Specular reflection\") system of the radiation could be detected by the shadow it casts on the accretion disk.[\\[45\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Inoue-2011-46)\n\nA Type III civilization using a \" [Fermi bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Center \"Galactic Center\")\" would be detectable by the fact that it decreases the luminosity of a region of the galaxy. An infrared observation would make it possible to highlight it, especially in [elliptical galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy \"Elliptical galaxy\"), Annis suggests.[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Carrigan_Jr.-20102-24)\n\n### Unusual objects\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=39 \"Edit section: Unusual objects\")\\]\n\n[![Color photo. A luminous celestial object appears against a black background.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Quasar_3C_273.jpg/500px-Quasar_3C_273.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Quasar_3C_273.jpg) Quasar [3C 273](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3C_273 \"3C 273\"), the brightest ever observed\n\nThe quasar [3C 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3C_9 \"3C 9\") is cited by Kardashev as early as 1971.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47) The study of the quasar [3C 273](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3C_273 \"3C 273\") shows that it has a solid structure. Other quasars ( [3C 279](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3C_279 \"3C 279\"), [3C 345](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3C_345 \"3C 345\"), 3C 84) have properties close to those expected from an artificial source, especially since the emissions are powerful in the intermediate region of the spectrum (between radio and optical frequencies).[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47) Quasars are potential artificial sources, especially since their age corresponds to the technical possibilities of supercivilizations. Radio sources at the center of galaxies can also be artificial sources, according to Kardashev, even if in 2013 they were proven to be supermassive black holes. In 1971, Kardashev believed that the objects most likely to be artificial sources could be discovered in the \\[then\\] next few years.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev-1971-47)\n\nThe extraordinary periodicity of [pulsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar \"Pulsar\") emissions was already considered an artificial source in 1968 by [Antony Hewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Hewish \"Antony Hewish\"), the discoverer of the first pulsar ( [CP 19019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1919%2B21 \"PSR B1919+21\")). The press of the time nicknamed this object \"LGM-1\" (for \"little green men\"), following the clumsiness of Hewish, who did not wait for the necessary verifications. Kaplan, in 1971, removed the pulsar from the list of objects that could be a source of artificial origin.[\\[60\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-:0-61)\n\nIn 2011, James and Dominic Benford examined the possibilities that exist to distinguish pulsars from possible artificial sources emitting intelligent signals, such as: bandwidth (signals of about 100 MHz could be artificial), pulse length (to reduce costs, the pulse should be short) and frequency (about 10 GHz, also for economic reasons). The [radio source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source \"Astronomical radio source\") PSR J1928+15 (observed in 2005 near the Galactic disk, at a frequency of 1.44 GHz, at [Arecibo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Observatory \"Arecibo Observatory\")) could be of extraterrestrial origin. James and Dominic Benford consider three scenarios in which the cost factor is taken into account. If the source is cost-optimized, it belongs to a civilization of Type 0.35 (the Earth being of Type 0.73).[\\[note 1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Sagan2sf-29) If it is not cost-optimized and operates with a small antenna, the Type is 0.86. With a large antenna, it would be from a Type 0.66. Using this cost/efficiency method, it can be estimated that low-intensity sources may be the most prevalent, but also the most difficult to observe.[\\[79\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-81)\n\n## Criticisms of the classification\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=40 \"Edit section: Criticisms of the classification\")\\]\n\n### Irrelevant assumptions\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=41 \"Edit section: Irrelevant assumptions\")\\]\n\nWilliam I. Newman and [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan \"Carl Sagan\") believe that the growth of energy consumption alone cannot describe the evolution of civilizations; it is also necessary to consider [population growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth \"Population growth\"), and in particular the fact that it can be limited by the transport capacity of interplanetary means of travel. They conclude that there can be no ancient civilizations of galactic dimensions, nor galactic empires, although the possibility of networks of colonized worlds (of about 5 to 10 planets) is strong.[\\[80\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-82)\n\nThe scale theorized by Kardashev was born in the geopolitical context of the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\"), in which energy had supreme value.[\\[27\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Wilson-20112-27) According to Guillermo A. Lemarchand, a physicist at the University of Buenos Aires, there are four arguments against Kardashev's classification:[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Lemarchand-20002-20)\n\n1. Long range omnidirectional transmitters would be very energy intensive. Using directional or intermittent devices, each pointing in a different direction, would require much less energy. Type II or III civilizations might therefore be defined by something other than exponential energy consumption.\n2. The assumption of exponential energy consumption is certainly wrong, because if we analyze per capita energy consumption throughout human history, it forms a series of [logistic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function \"Logistic function\") with a saturation point for each technological innovation. Therefore, a steady state or limited growth is more likely.\n3. According to the [principle of mediocrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediocrity_principle \"Mediocrity principle\"), applied to the search for extraterrestrial civilizations by Sagan and Shklovskii in 1966 on the basis of [John Richard Gott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Richard_Gott \"J. Richard Gott\")'s calculations,[\\[81\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-83) civilizations more important than ours must be so rare that they do not have the possibility to dominate and be visible.\n4. Finally, research and listening programs in Harvard University and Buenos Aires (Horowitz and Sagan in 1993 or Lemarchand et al. in 1997) have not provided any scientific proof of the existence of artificial sources, neither in the Milky Way nor in nearby galaxies ( [M33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M33_X-7 \"M33 X-7\"), [M81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M81_Group \"M81 Group\"), the [Whirlpool Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlpool_Galaxy \"Whirlpool Galaxy\") or [Centaurus A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaurus_A \"Centaurus A\")), or even in the [Virgo cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_Cluster \"Virgo Cluster\").\n\nFor the British meteorologist [Lewis Fry Richardson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Fry_Richardson \"Lewis Fry Richardson\"), author of a statistical study on mortality (published in _Statistics of Deadly Quarrels_, 1960), man's aggressiveness does not allow us to predict a [life span](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy \"Life expectancy\") that will allow humanity to reach more evolved stages. He estimates that man's violent [impulses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulsivity \"Impulsivity\") will destroy the social order over a period of 1000 years. Moreover, mankind will probably be destroyed with [weapons of mass destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction \"Weapon of mass destruction\") within a few centuries at the most.[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Lemarchand-20002-20)\n\n[Transhumanists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism \"Transhumanism\") Paul Hughes and John Smart explain the absence of signals from a Type III civilization with two hypotheses: either it has self-destructed or it has not followed the trajectory described by Kardashev.[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Galantai-2006-23) The growth of energy consumption should lead to a climate crisis, which [Yvan Dutil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvan_Dutil \"Yvan Dutil\") and [Stéphane Dumas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Dumas_(astrophysicist) \"Stéphane Dumas (astrophysicist)\") set at 1 [W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt \"Watt\")/m2 of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth \"Earth\") or 127 [TW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terawatt \"Terawatt\") for the entire planet. At a growth rate of 2% per year, an industrial civilization should stop growing quite early in its history (after a few centuries).[\\[48\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Dutil-2007-49) In summary, the impossibility of sustainably securing energy resources may explain the absence of Type II and III civilizations.[\\[48\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Dutil-2007-49)\n\nFor Zoltan Galántai, it is not possible to imagine a civilization project that spans centuries (like a [Dyson sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere \"Dyson sphere\")) or even millions of years, unless one imagines a thought and an [ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics \"Ethics\") different from ours, within the reach of an ancestral civilization. He therefore proposes to classify civilizations according to their ability to carry out large-scale civilization projects over the long term.[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Galantai-2006-23)\n\nFinally, for [Freeman Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson \"Freeman Dyson\"), communication and life can continue forever in an [open Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe \"Shape of the universe\") with a finite amount of energy; intelligence is therefore the only fundamental parameter for a civilization to survive in the very long term, and energy is then no longer what defines it, a thesis he develops in his article \"Time Without End: Physics and Biology in an Open Universe\".[\\[82\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-84)\n\n## Energy development\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=42 \"Edit section: Energy development\")\\]\n\nSee also: [Energy development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_development \"Energy development\")\n\n### Type I civilization methods\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=43 \"Edit section: Type I civilization methods\")\\]\n\n- Large-scale application of [fusion power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power \"Fusion power\"): In terms of [mass–energy equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence \"Mass–energy equivalence\"), Type I implies the conversion of about 2 kg of matter to energy per second.

Their [energy density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density \"Energy density\") (energy released per mass) is about four orders of magnitude greater than that from using [nuclear fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission \"Nuclear fission\"), and about two orders of magnitude greater than the best possible yield from [fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion \"Nuclear fusion\").[\\[84\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-86) The reaction of 1 [kg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram \"Kilogram\") of antimatter with 1 kg of matter would produce 1.8×1017 [J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule \"Joule\") (180 [petajoules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petajoules \"Petajoules\")) of energy.[\\[85\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-87) Although antimatter is sometimes proposed as a source of energy,[\\[86\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-88) this does not seem feasible. Artificially producing antimatter – according to current understanding of the laws of physics – involves first converting energy into mass, which yields no net energy. Artificially created antimatter is usable only as an energy storage medium, not as an energy source, unless future technological developments (contrary to the conservation of the [baryon number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_number \"Baryon number\"), such as a [CP violation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_violation \"CP violation\") in favor of antimatter) allow the conversion of ordinary matter into anti-matter. Theoretically, humans may be able to cultivate and harvest a number of naturally occurring sources of antimatter in the future.[\\[87\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-89)[\\[88\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-90)[\\[89\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-91)\n- [Renewable energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy \"Renewable energy\") by converting sunlight into electricity – either directly through [solar cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell \"Solar cell\") and [concentrating solar power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrating_solar_power \"Concentrating solar power\"), or indirectly through [biofuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofuel \"Biofuel\"), [wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power \"Wind power\"), and [hydroelectric power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectric_power \"Hydroelectric power\"): There is no known way for a [human civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization \"Civilization\") to harness the equivalent of the Earth's total absorbed solar energy without completely covering the surface with man-made structures, which is not feasible with current technology. However, if a civilization constructed very large [space-based solar power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power \"Space-based solar power\") [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite \"Satellite\"), Type I power levels might become achievable—these could convert sunlight to microwave power and beam it to collectors on Earth.\n\n### Type II civilization methods\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=44 \"Edit section: Type II civilization methods\")\\]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Dyson_Swarm_-_2.png/500px-Dyson_Swarm_-_2.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dyson_Swarm_-_2.png) A figure of a [Dyson swarm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_Swarm \"Dyson Swarm\") surrounding a star\n\n- Type II civilizations could use the same techniques as a Type I civilization, but applied to a large number of planets in a large number of star systems.\n- A [Dyson sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere \"Dyson sphere\") or [Dyson swarm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_swarm \"Dyson swarm\") and similar constructs are hypothetical [megastructures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megastructure \"Megastructure\") originally described by [Freeman Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson \"Freeman Dyson\") as a system of orbiting [solar power satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_satellite \"Solar power satellite\") designed to completely encircle a [star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star \"Star\") and capture most or all of its energy output.[\\[90\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-92)\n- Another means of generating usable energy would be to feed a stellar mass into a [black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole \"Black hole\"), and collect the photons emitted by the [accretion disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk \"Accretion disk\").[\\[91\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-93)[\\[92\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-94) A less exotic means would be to simply capture photons already escaping from the accretion disk, thereby reducing a black hole's [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum \"Angular momentum\"); this is known as the [Penrose process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_process \"Penrose process\"). However, this may only be possible for a Type III civilization.\n- [Star lifting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_lifting \"Star lifting\") is a process by which an advanced civilization could remove a substantial portion of a star's matter in a controlled manner for other uses.\n- [Antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter \"Antimatter\") is likely to be produced as an industrial [byproduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byproduct \"Byproduct\") of a number of [megascale engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megascale_engineering \"Megascale engineering\") processes (such as the aforementioned star lifting), and could therefore be recycled.\\[ _[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_\\]\n- In [multiple star systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_system \"Star system\") with a sufficiently large number of stars: absorbing a small but significant fraction of the output of each individual star.\n- [Stellar engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_engine \"Stellar engine\") can be used to move stars.\n\n### Type III civilization methods\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=45 \"Edit section: Type III civilization methods\")\\]\n\n- Type III civilizations might use the same techniques as a Type II civilization, but applied individually to all possible stars in one or more galaxies.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-Kardashev1985-5)\n- They may also be able to tap into the energy released by the [supermassive black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole \"Supermassive black hole\") believed to exist at the center of most galaxies.[\\[93\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-95)\n- [White holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_holes \"White holes\") could theoretically provide large amounts of energy by collecting the matter ejected outward.\n- Capturing the energy of [gamma-ray bursts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst \"Gamma-ray burst\") is another theoretically possible power source for an advanced civilization.\n- The emissions from [quasars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasars \"Quasars\") are comparable to those from small active galaxies and could be a massive power source if they could be collected.\n\n## Civilization implications\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=46 \"Edit section: Civilization implications\")\\]\n\nThere are many historical examples of human civilization undergoing large-scale transitions, such as the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution \"Industrial Revolution\"). The transitions between Kardashev scale levels could potentially represent similarly dramatic periods of social upheaval, as they involve exceeding the hard limits of the resources available within a civilization's existing territory. A common speculation[\\[94\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#cite_note-96) is that the transition from Type 0 to Type I could carry a strong risk of self-destruction, since in some scenarios there would be no room for further expansion on the civilization's home planet, as in a [Malthusian catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_catastrophe \"Malthusian catastrophe\").\n\nFor example, excessive energy consumption without adequate heat removal could plausibly render the planet of a Type I approaching civilization unsuitable for the biology of the [dominant life forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human \"Human\") and their food sources. Using Earth as an example, ocean temperatures above 95 °F (35 °C) would endanger marine life and make it difficult, if not impossible, for mammals to cool to temperatures suitable for their [metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism \"Metabolism\"). Of course, these [theoretical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical \"Theoretical\") speculations may not become problems, possibly through the application of future [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_engineering \"Climate engineering\") and [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology \"Technology\"). Also, by the time a civilization reaches Type I, it may have colonized other planets or established [O'Neill-type colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder \"O'Neill cylinder\"), so that waste heat could be distributed throughout the star system.\n\nThe limitations of biological life forms and the evolution of computer technology may lead to the transformation of the civilization through [mind uploading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading \"Mind uploading\") and [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence \"Artificial general intelligence\") in general during the transition from Type I to Type II, leading to a [digitized civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain \"Matrioshka brain\").\n\n## See also\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kardashev_scale&action=edit&section=47 \"Edit section: See also\")\\]\n\n-

Alongside the technological advancement, TT considers wider societal changes such as \"user practices, regulation, industrial networks (supply, production, distribution), infrastructure, and symbolic meaning or culture\".[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Geels-2) Hughes[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-3) refers to the 'seamless web' where physical artifacts, organizations, scientific communities, and social practices combine. A technological transition occurs when there is a major shift in these socio-technical configurations.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Geels-2)[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-4)\n\n## Origins\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technological_transitions&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Origins\")\\]\n\nWork on technological transitions draws on a number of fields including [history of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science \"History of science\"), technology studies, and [evolutionary economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_economics \"Evolutionary economics\").[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Geels-2) The focus of evolutionary economics is on economic change, but as a driver of this [technological change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_change \"Technological change\") has been considered in the literature.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Geels_a-5) Joseph [Schumpeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumpeter \"Schumpeter\"), in his classic _Theory of Economic Development_[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-6) placed the emphasis on non-economic forces as the driver for growth. The human actor, the entrepreneur is seen as the cause of economic development which occurs as a cyclical process. [Schumpeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumpeter \"Schumpeter\") proposed that radical innovations were the catalyst for Kondratiev cycles.\n\n### Long wave theory\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technological_transitions&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Long wave theory\")\\]\n\nThe Russian economist Kondratiev[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-7) proposed that economic growth operated in boom and bust cycles of approximately 50 year periods. These cycles were characterised by periods of expansion, stagnation and recession. The period of expansion is associated with the introduction of a new technology, e.g. steam power or the microprocessor. At the time of publication, [Kondratiev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kondratiev \"Kondratiev\") had considered that two cycles had occurred in the nineteenth century and third was beginning at the turn of the twentieth. Modern writers, such as Freeman and Perez[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Freeman-8) outlined five cycles in the modern age:\n\n- [The Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Industrial_Revolution \"The Industrial Revolution\") (1770–1830)\n- Victorian Prosperity: Age of steam and Rail (1830–1880)\n- The Age of Steel (1880–1930)\n- Oil, Mass Production and the Consumer Society (1930–1980)\n- The Information Age (1980-?)\n\nFreeman and Perez[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Freeman-8) proposed that each cycle consists of pervasive technologies, their production and economic structures that support them. Termed 'techno-economic paradigms', they suggest that the shift from one paradigm to another is the result of emergent new technologies.\n\nAfter the [2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis \"2008 financial crisis\"), authors such as Moody and Nogrady[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-9) have suggested that a new cycle is emerging from the old, centred on the use of sustainable technologies in a resource depleted world.\n\n### Technological paradigms, trajectories and regimes\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technological_transitions&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Technological paradigms, trajectories and regimes\")\\]\n\n[Thomas Kuhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn \"Thomas Kuhn\")[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-10) described how a paradigm shift is a wholesale shift in the basic understanding of a scientific theory. Examples in science include the change of thought from miasma to germ theory as a cause of disease. Building on this work, [Giovanni Dosi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Dosi \"Giovanni Dosi\")[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-11) developed the concept of 'technical paradigms' and 'technological trajectories'. In considering how engineers work, the technical paradigm is an outlook on the technological problem, a definition of what the problems and solutions are. It charts the idea of specific progress. By identifying the problems to be solved the paradigm exerts an influence on technological change. The pattern of problem solving activity and the direction of progress is the technological trajectory. In similar fashion, Nelson and Winter (,[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-12)[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-13))defined the concept of the 'technological regime' which directs technological change through the beliefs of engineers of what problems to solve. The work of the actors and organisations is the result of organisational and cognitive routines which determines search behaviour. This places boundaries and also trajectories (direction) to those boundaries.\n\n## Multi-level perspective (MLP) on technological transitions\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technological_transitions&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Multi-level perspective (MLP) on technological transitions\")\\]\n\n### Socio-technical systems and transitions\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technological_transitions&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Socio-technical systems and transitions\")\\]\n\nRecently, the scope of academic sustainability discourse and investigative focus has broadened beyond the study of technological products, innovations and subsequent transitions.[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Geels_2005-14) Much of the literature now examines technological artefacts and innovations through a wider scope of socio-technical systems.[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-15) It has been argued that this contemporary framework has emerged in response to both an increased understanding of the urgency of environmental problems and the recognition that more substantiative transitions are required across multiple interdependent systems to mitigate impacts.[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-16)\n\nThe technological transitions framework does acknowledge the co-evolution and mutual unfolding of societal change alongside technological innovation. However, the socio-technical transitions framework considers a more encompassing view of the interdependent links that technology maintains with systems that both generate the need for new innovations and ultimately produce and maintain them.[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-17) More specifically, the systems that comprise the socio-technical paradigm include technology, supply networks, infrastructure, maintenance networks, regulation, cultural meaning as well as user practices and markets.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-18) As such, socio-technical transitions can be defined as the multi-dimensional shift from one socio-technical system to another involving changes in both technological and social systems that are intrinsically linked in a feedback loop.[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Geels_2005-14) Generally speaking, socio-technical transitions are a slow process as technological innovation tends to occur incrementally along fixed trajectories due to the rigidity of economic, social, cultural, infrastructural and regulative norms.[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-ReferenceA-19) This is referred to as path dependency, creating technological 'lock-ins' which prevent innovation that disrupts the status quo.[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Twomey_and_Gaziulusoy_2014-20) Therefore, the breakthrough and dissemination of technological innovations is dependent on more than their respective benefits, providing an insight into the complexity of the forces and multiple dimensions at play.\n\n### Multi-level perspective (MLP) framework\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technological_transitions&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Multi-level perspective (MLP) framework\")\\]\n\nThe multi-level perspective (MLP) is an analytical tool that attempts to deal with this complexity and resistance to change. Focussing on the dynamics of wider transitionary developments as opposed to discrete technological innovations, the MLP concerns itself with socio-technical system transformations, particularly with transitions towards sustainability and resilience.[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-21) As the name implies, the MLP posits three analytical and heuristic levels on which processes interact and align to result in socio-technical system transformations; **landscape (macro-level), regimes (meso-level) and niches (micro-level)**.[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-22) Firstly, the **regime** level represents the current structures and practices characterised by dominant rules, institutions and technologies that are self-reinforcing.[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-23) The socio-technical regime is dynamically stable in the sense that innovation still transpires albeit incrementally and along a predictable trajectory.[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Geels_2005-14) This makes the regime 'locked-in' and resistant to both technological and social transitions.[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-24) Secondly, the **landscape** level is defined as the exogenous, broader contextual developments in deep-seated cultural patterns, macro-economics, macro-politics and spatial structures, potentially arising from shocks associated with wars, economic crisis, natural disaster and political upheaval.[\\[25\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-25) Additionally, landscapes are beyond the direct influence of actors, yet stimulate and exert pressure on them at the regime and niche levels. Finally, the **niche** is defined as the \"locus for radical innovations\" where dedicated actors nurture the development of technological novelties.[\\[26\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-26) Incubated from market and regulation influences, the niche fosters innovations that differ fundamentally from the prevailing regime and usually require landscape developments that open windows of opportunity in at the regime level.[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-ReferenceA-19) Therefore, the MLP attributes socio-technical transitions to the interaction of stabilising forces at the regime level with destabilising forces from both the landscape and niche levels.[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Twomey_and_Gaziulusoy_2014-20)\n\n### MLP application - automobility regime\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technological_transitions&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: MLP application - automobility regime\")\\]\n\nDue to the systems approach inherent in the MLP, analysis can be approached from different disciplinary perspectives according to their respective ontologies and priorities. From an urban planning perspective, the framework could be used to pinpoint the barriers and drivers associated with low carbon transport systems to better target policy efforts.[\\[27\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-27) To begin, from an urban mobility perspective, the landscape level is currently pressured by both stabilising and destabilising pressures. Namely, Peak Oil, public concern surrounding inaction towards [climate change mitigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation \"Climate change mitigation\") and information technologies that digitise daily life (e.g. tele-commuting) destabilises the landscape and automobility regime.[\\[28\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-ReferenceB-28) Conversely, the landscape level is solidified by stabilising forces such as cultural preferences for private ownership, timesaving, autonomy and privacy, as well as car-favouring urban fabric and infrastructure.[\\[29\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Geels_2012-29) This is further enhanced by universal pressures of globalisation which presupposes urban mobility to increase flows of goods and people.[\\[28\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-ReferenceB-28)\n\nThis tension between stabilising and destabilising forces is mirrored in the prevailing automobility regime. The regime is stabilised by persistent investment in road projects, lifestyle norms and consumer preferences that perpetuate car use and resistance to major change by vested actors such as transport planners, policy makers and industry actors (e.g. car manufactures).[\\[29\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Geels_2012-29) Despite this stability, shifts in the landscape has allowed \"cracks\" in the regime such as traffic management policy (traffic calming, parking restrictions, etc.), diminishing policy commitment to the regime and industry actors proclaiming awareness of landscape pressures associated with climate change [\\[30\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-30)\n\nIn these contexts, niche socio-technical innovations that challenge the assumptions and norms of the regime have been birthed, mainly in the form of local policy and infrastructure initiatives on a city-scale. For example, intermodal travel in the form of bus/bike-rail integration schemes, bike rental/sharing have been trialled in many cities globally.[\\[29\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Geels_2012-29) Also, niche sustainable urban planning concepts such as compact cities, smart growth and transit-oriented development have modestly emerged into sustainably mobility discourse.[\\[29\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Geels_2012-29) However, the persistence of the automobility regime due to the general stability of the landscape has resulted in limited, small-scale implementations of these niche innovations.[\\[29\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Geels_2012-29) As such, prevailing user preference and cultural values at the landscape level appear to be a major barrier in transport system socio-technical transitions, as they stabilise the automobility regime, disallowing niche innovations to gain a foothold.\n\n## Transition paths\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technological_transitions&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Transition paths\")\\]\n\nThe nature of transitions varies and the differing qualities result in multiple pathways occurring. Geels and Schot [\\[31\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-31) defined five transition paths:\n\n- Reproduction: Ongoing change occurring in the regime level.\n- Transformation: A socio-technical regime that changes without the emergence of a monopolising technology.\n- Technological substitution: An incumbent technology is replaced by a radical innovation resulting in a new socio-technical regime.\n- De-alignment and Re-alignment: Weaknesses in the regime sees the advent of competing new technologies leading to a dominant model. (E.g. the automobile replacing the horse as the primary means of land transport).\n- Re-configuration: When multiple, interlinked technologies are replaced by a similarly linked alternative set.\n\n## Characteristics of technological transitions\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technological_transitions&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Characteristics of technological transitions\")\\]\n\nSix characteristics of technological transitions have been identified.,[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Evans-1)[\\[32\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-32)\n\n_Transitions are co-evolutionary and multi-dimensional_\nTechnological developments occur intertwined with societal needs, wants and uses. A technology is adopted and diffused based on this interplay between innovation and societal requirements. Co-evolution has different aspects. As well as the co-evolution of technology and society, aspects between science, technology, users and culture have been considered.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Geels_a-5)\n\n_Multi-actors are involved_\nScientific and engineering communities are central to the development of a technology, but a wide range of actors are involved in a transition. This can include organisations, policy-makers, government, NGOs, special interest groups and others.\n\n_Transitions occur at multiple levels_\nAs shown in the MLP, transitions occur through the interplay of processes at different levels.\n\n_Transitions are a long-term process_\nComplete system-change takes time and can be decades in the making. Case studies show them to be between 40 and 90 years.[\\[33\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Genus-33)\n\n_Transitions are radical_\nFor a true transition to occur the technology has to be a radical innovation.\n\n_Change is Non-linear_\nThe rate of change will vary over time. For example, the pace of change may be slow at the gestation period (at the niche level) but much more rapid when a breakthrough is occurring.\n\n## Diffusion: transition phases\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technological_transitions&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Diffusion: transition phases\")\\]\n\nDiffusion of an innovation is the concept of how it is picked up by society, at what rate and why.[\\[34\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-34) The diffusion of a technological innovation into society can be considered in distinct phases.[\\[35\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Rotmans-35) Pre-development is the gestation period where the new technology has yet to make an impact. Take-off is when the process of a system shift is beginning. A breakthrough is occurring when fundamental changes are occurring in existing structures through the interplay of economic, social and cultural forces. Once the rate of change has decreased and a new balance is achieved, stabilization is said to have occurred. A full transition involves an overhaul of existing rules and change of beliefs which takes time, typically spanning at least a generation.[\\[35\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Rotmans-35) This process can be speeded up through seismic, unforeseen events such as war or economic strife.\n\nGeels[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Geels_a-5) proposed a similar four-phase approach which draws on the multi-level perspective (MLP) developed by Dutch scholars. Phase one sees the emergence of a novelty, born from the existing regime. Development then occurs in the niche level at phase two. As before, breakthrough then occurs at phase three. In the parlance of the MLP the new technology, having been developed at the niche level, is in competition with the established regime. To break through and achieve wide diffusion, external factors – 'windows of opportunity' – are required.\n\n## Windows of opportunity\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technological_transitions&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section: Windows of opportunity\")\\]\n\nA number of possible circumstances can act as windows of opportunity for the diffusion of new technologies:\n\n- Internal technical problems in the existing regime. Those that cannot be solved by refinement of existing technologies act as a driver for the new.\n- Problems external to the system. Such 'problems' are often determined by pressure groups and require wider societal or political backing. An example is environmental concerns.\n- Changing user preferences. Opportunities are presented if existing technologies cannot meet user needs.\n- Strategic advantage. Competition with rivals may necessitate innovation\n- Complementary technology. The availability of which may enable a breakthrough\n\nAlongside external influences, internal drivers catalyse diffusion.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Geels_a-5) These include economic factors such as the price performance ration. Socio-technical perspectives focus on the links between disparate social and technological elements.[\\[36\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Rip-36) Following the breakthrough, the final phases see the new technology supersede the old.\n\n## Societal relevance\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technological_transitions&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit section: Societal relevance\")\\]\n\nThe study of technological transitions has an impact beyond academic interest. The transitions referred to in the literature may relate to historic processes, such as the transportation transitions studied by Geels, but system changes are required to achieve a safe transition to a [low-carbon economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy \"Low-carbon economy\"). ([\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Evans-1)[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Geels_a-5)). Current structural problems are apparent in a range of sectors.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Geels_a-5) Dependency on oil is problematic in the energy sector due to availability, access and contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Transportation is a major user of energy causing significant emission of GHGs. Food production will need to keep pace with an ever-growing world population while overcoming challenges presented by global warming and transportation issues. Incremental change has provided some improvements but a more radical transition is required to achieve a more sustainable future.\n\nDeveloped from the work on technological transitions is the field of transition management. Within this is an attempt to shape the direction of change complex socio-technical systems to more sustainable patterns.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Evans-1) Whereas work on technological transitions is largely based on historic processes, proponents of transition management seek to actively steer transitions in progress.\n\n## Criticisms\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technological_transitions&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: Criticisms\")\\]\n\nGenus and Coles[\\[33\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-Genus-33) outlined a number of criticisms against the analysis of technological transitions, in particular when using the MLP. Empirical research on technological transitions occurring now has been limited, with the focus on historic transitions. Depending on the perspective on transition case studies they could be presented as having occurred on a different transition path to what was shown. For example, the bicycle could be considered an intermediate transport technology between the horse and the car. Judged from shorter different time-frame this could appear a transition in its own right. Determining the nature of a transition is problematic; when it started and ended, or whether one occurred in the sense of a radical innovation displacing an existing socio-technical regime. The perception of time casts doubt on whether a transition has occurred. If viewed over a long enough period even inert regimes may demonstrate radical change in the end. The MLP has also been criticised by scholars studying sustainability transitions using Social Practice Theories.[\\[37\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_note-37)\n\n## See also\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technological_transitions&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit section: See also\")\\]\n\n- [Evolutionary economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_economics \"Evolutionary economics\")\n- [Kondratiev wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kondratiev_wave \"Kondratiev wave\")\n- [Technological change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_change \"Technological change\")\n- [Technological innovation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_innovation_system \"Technological innovation system\")\n- [Technology policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_policy \"Technology policy\")\n- [Technological revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_revolution \"Technological revolution\")\n- [Transition Management (Governance)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_Management_(Governance) \"Transition Management (Governance)\")\n\n## References\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technological_transitions&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit section: References\")\\]\n\n01. ^ [_**a**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_ref-Evans_1-0) [_**b**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_ref-Evans_1-1) [_**c**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_ref-Evans_1-2) [_**d**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#cite_ref-Evans_1-3)Evans, J.

      "content": "[Jump to content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#bodyContent)\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nTheoretical framework of management cybernetics\n\nThe **viable system model** ( **VSM**) is a [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(abstract) \"Model (abstract)\") of the organizational structure of any [autonomous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous \"Autonomous\") [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System \"System\") capable of producing itself. It is an implementation of [viable system theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_theory \"Viable system theory\"). At the biological level, this model is correspondent to [autopoiesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis \"Autopoiesis\").\n\nA viable system is any system organised in such a way as to meet the demands of surviving in the changing environment. One of the prime features of systems that survive is that they are adaptable. The VSM expresses a model for a viable system, which is an abstracted [cybernetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetic \"Cybernetic\") (regulation theory) description that is claimed to be applicable to any organisation that is a viable system and capable of autonomy.\n\n## Overview\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viable_system_model&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Overview\")\\]\n\nThe model was developed by [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research \"Operations research\") theorist and [cybernetician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics \"Cybernetics\") [Stafford Beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Stafford_Beer \"Anthony Stafford Beer\") in his book _Brain of the Firm_ (1972).[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_note-1) Together with Beer's earlier works on cybernetics applied to management, this book effectively founded [management cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_cybernetics \"Management cybernetics\").\n\nThe first thing to note about the cybernetic theory of organizations encapsulated in the VSM is that viable systems are [recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion \"Recursion\"); viable systems contain viable systems that can be modeled using an identical cybernetic description as the higher (and lower) level systems in the containment hierarchy (Beer expresses this property of viable systems as _cybernetic isomorphism_).\nA development of this model has originated the theoretical proposal called [viable systems approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_systems_approach \"Viable systems approach\").\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/VSM_Default_Version_English_with_two_operational_systems.png/500px-VSM_Default_Version_English_with_two_operational_systems.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VSM_Default_Version_English_with_two_operational_systems.png) An exemplary model of a corporation as a viable system. Assumption: There is one System 1 purchasing external resources and one System 1 which produces the value, delivered to the customers. The VSM applies for all kinds of organizations.\n\n## Components\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viable_system_model&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Components\")\\]\n\nHere we give a brief introduction to the cybernetic description of the organization encapsulated in a single level of the VSM.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_note-2)\n\nA viable system is composed of five interacting subsystems which may be mapped onto aspects of organizational structure. In broad terms Systems 1–3[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_note-3) are concerned with the 'here and now' of the organization's operations, System 4 is concerned with the 'there and then' – strategical responses to the effects of external, environmental and future demands on the organization.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_note-4) System 5 is concerned with balancing the 'here and now' and the 'there and then' to give policy directives which maintain the organization as a viable entity.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_note-5)\n\n- _System 1_ in a viable system contains several primary activities. Each System 1 primary activity is itself a viable system due to the recursive nature of systems as described above. These are concerned with performing a function that implements at least part of the key transformation of the organization.\n- _System 2_ represents the information channels and bodies that allow the primary activities in System 1 to communicate between each other and which allow System 3 to monitor and co-ordinate the activities within System 1. Represents the scheduling function of shared resources to be used by System 1.\n- _System 3_ represents the structures and controls that are put into place to establish the rules, resources, rights and responsibilities of System 1 and to provide an interface with Systems 4/5. Represents the big picture view of the processes inside of System 1.\n- _System 4_ is made up of bodies that are responsible for looking outwards to the environment to monitor how the organization needs to adapt to remain viable.\n- _System 5_ is responsible for policy decisions within the organization as a whole to balance demands from different parts of the organization and steer the organization as a whole.\n\nIn addition to the subsystems that make up the first level of recursion, the environment is represented in the model. The presence of the environment in the model is necessary as the domain of action of the system and without it there is no way in the model to contextualize or ground the internal interactions of the organization.\n\n_Algedonic alerts_ (from the Greek αλγος, pain and ηδος, pleasure) are alarms and rewards that escalate through the levels of recursion when actual performance fails or exceeds capability, typically after a [timeout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeout_(telecommunication) \"Timeout (telecommunication)\").\n\nThe model is derived from the architecture of the brain and nervous system. Systems 3-2-1 are identified with the ancient brain or [autonomic nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system \"Autonomic nervous system\"). System 4 embodies cognition and conversation. System 5, the higher brain functions, include introspection and decision making.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_note-6)\n\n## Rules for the viable system\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viable_system_model&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Rules for the viable system\")\\]\n\nIn \"Heart of Enterprise\"[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_note-7) a companion volume to \"Brain...\", Beer applies [Ashby's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ross_Ashby \"William Ross Ashby\") concept of (Requisite) [Variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(cybernetics) \"Variety (cybernetics)\"): the number of possible states of a system or of an element of the system. There are two aphorisms that permit observers to calculate Variety; four Principles of Organization; the Recursive System Theorem; three Axioms of Management and a Law of Cohesion. These rules ensure the Requisite Variety condition is satisfied, in effect that resources are matched to requirement.\n\n### Regulatory aphorisms\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viable_system_model&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Regulatory aphorisms\")\\]\n\nThese aphorisms are:[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_note-8)[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_note-9)\n\n- It is not necessary to enter the [black box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box \"Black box\") to understand the nature of the function it performs.\n- It is not necessary to enter the black box to calculate the variety that it potentially may generate.\n\n### Principles of organization\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viable_system_model&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Principles of organization\")\\]\n\n(Principles are 'primary sources of particular outcome')\n\nThese principles are:\n\n- Managerial, operational and environmental varieties diffusing through an institutional system, tend to equate; they should be _designed_ to do so with minimum damage to people and cost.\n- The four directional channels carrying information between the management unit, the operation, and the environment must each have a higher capacity to transmit a given amount of information relevant to variety selection in a given time than the originating subsystem has to generate it in that time.\n- Wherever the information carried on a channel capable of distinguishing a given variety crosses a boundary, it undergoes [transduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer \"Transducer\") (converting energy from one form to another); the variety of the transducer must be at least equivalent to the variety of the channel.\n- The operation of the first three principles must be cyclically maintained without delays.\n\n### Recursive system theorem\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viable_system_model&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Recursive system theorem\")\\]\n\nThis theorem states:\n\n- In a [recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion \"Recursion\") organizational structure any viable system contains, and is contained in, a viable system.\n- Society itself can be seen as a system of [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion \"Recursion\"). In this case, recursion refers to systems that are nested within other systems.\n\n[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_note-10)\n\n### Axioms\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viable_system_model&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Axioms\")\\]\n\n(Axioms are statements 'worthy of belief')\n\nThese axioms are:\n\n- The sum of horizontal variety disposed by _n_ operational elements (systems one) equals the sum of the vertical variety disposed by the six vertical components of corporate cohesion.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_note-11) (The six are from Environment, System Three\\*, the System Ones, System Two, System Three and Algedonic alerts.)\n- The variety disposed by System Three resulting from the operation of the First Axiom equals the variety disposed by System Four.\n- The variety disposed by System Five equals the residual variety generated by the operation of the Second Axiom.\n\n### The law of cohesion for multiple recursions of the viable system\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viable_system_model&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: The law of cohesion for multiple recursions of the viable system\")\\]\n\nThis law ('something invariant in nature') states:\n\n- The System One variety accessible to System Three of recursion _x_ equals the variety disposed by the sum of the metasystems of recursion _y_ for every recursive pair.[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_note-12)\n\n## Measuring performance\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viable_system_model&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Measuring performance\")\\]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Performance.png/500px-Performance.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Performance.png) Three measures of capacity producing three measures of achievement\n\nIn _Brain of the Firm_ (p. 163) Beer describes a triple vector to characterize activity in a System 1. The components are:\n\n- Actuality: \"What we _are_ managing to do now, with existing resources, under existing constraints.\"\n- Capability: \"This is what we _could_ be doing (still right now) with existing resources, under existing constraints, if we really worked at it.\"\n- Potentiality: \"This is what we ought to be doing by developing our resources and removing constraints, although still operating within the bounds of what is already known to be feasible.\"\n\nBeer adds \"It would help a lot to fix these definitions clearly in the mind.\" System 4's job is essentially to realize potential. He then defines\n\n- Productivity: is the ratio of actuality and capability;\n- Latency: is the ratio of capability and potentiality;\n- Performance: is the ratio of actuality and potentiality, and also the product of latency and productivity.\n\nConsider the management of a process with cash earnings or savings for a company or government:\n\nPotentially £100,000 but aiming to make £ 60,000. Actually sales, savings or taxes of £40,000 are realized.So Potentiality = £100,000; Capability = £60,000; Actuality = £40,000.Thus latency = 60/100 = 0.6; Productivity = 40/60 = 0.67; And performance = 0.6 × 0.67 = 0.4 (or actuality/potential 40/100).\n\nThese methods (also known as normalisations) can be similarly applied in general e.g. to hours worked in the performance of tasks or products in a production process of some kind.\n\nWhen actuality deviates from capability, because someone did something well or something badly, an algedonic alert is sent to management. If corrective action, adoption of a good technique or correction of an error, is not taken in a timely manner the alert is escalated. Because the criteria are applied in an [ordered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory \"Order theory\") hierarchy the management itself need not be, but the routine response functions must be ordered to reflect best known [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic \"Heuristic\") practice. These heuristics are constantly monitored for improvement by the organization's System 4s.\n\nPay structures reflect these constraints on performance when capability or potential is realized with, for example, productivity [bonuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance-related_pay \"Performance-related pay\"), [stakeholder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_stakeholder \"Project stakeholder\") agreements and [intellectual property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property \"Intellectual property\") rights.\n\n## Metalanguage\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viable_system_model&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Metalanguage\")\\]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Beer_Metalnaguage.PNG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Beer_Metalnaguage.PNG) Resolving undecidability by raising the metalanguage\n\nIn ascending the recursions of the viable system the context of each autonomous 5-4-3-2 [metasystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasystem \"Metasystem\") enlarges and acquires more [variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(cybernetics) \"Variety (cybernetics)\").\n\nThis defines a [metalanguage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalanguage \"Metalanguage\") stack of increasing capability to resolve [undecidability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem \"Undecidable problem\") in the autonomous lower levels. If someone near process level needs to innovate to achieve potential, or restore capability, help can be secured from management of higher variety.\n\nAn algedonic alert, sent when actuality deviates by some [statistically significant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance \"Statistical significance\") amount from capability, makes this process automatic.\n\nThe notion of adding more variety or states to resolve [ambiguity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity \"Ambiguity\") or undecidability (also known as the [decision problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem \"Decision problem\")) is the subject of [Chaitin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin \"Chaitin\")'s [metamathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamathematics \"Metamathematics\") conjecture [algorithmic information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_information_theory \"Algorithmic information theory\") and provides a potentially rigorous theoretical basis for a general management heuristic. If a process is not producing the agreed product more information, if applicable, will correct this, resolve ambiguity, [conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_resolution \"Conflict resolution\") or undecidability.\n\nIn \"Platform for Change\" (Beer 1975) the thesis is developed via a collection of papers to learned bodies, including UK Police and Hospitals, to produce a visualization of the \"Total System\". Here a \"Relevant ethic\" evolves from \"Experimental ethics\" and the \"Ethic with a busted gut\" to produce a sustainable earth with reformed \"old institutions\" becoming \"new institutions\" driven by approval (eudemonic[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_note-13) criteria \"Questions of Metric\" in Platform... pp 163– 179) from the \"software milieu\" while culture adopts the [systems approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_approach \"Systems approach\") and \" [Homo faber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_faber \"Homo faber\")\" (man the maker) becomes \"Homo Gubernator\" (self-steering).[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_note-14)\n\n## Applying VSM\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viable_system_model&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section: Applying VSM\")\\]\n\nIn applying the VSM [variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(cybernetics) \"Variety (cybernetics)\") measures are used to match people, machines and money to jobs that produce products or services. In a set of processes some jobs are done by one person. Some are done by many and often many processes are done by the same person. Throughout the working day a participant, in completing a task, may find the focus shifts between internal and external Systems 1–5 from moment to moment.\n\nThe choices, or decisions discriminated, and their cost (or effort) defines the variety and hence resources needed for the job. The processes (Systems 1) are operationally managed by System 3 by monitoring performance and assuring (System 2) the flow of product between System 1s and out to users.\n\nSystem 3 is able to audit (via 3\\*) past performance so \"bad times\" for production can be compared to \"good times\". If things go wrong and levels of [risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk \"Risk\") increase the System 3 asks for help or puts it to colleagues for a remedy. This is the pain of an algedonic alert, which can be automatic when performance fails to achieve capability targets. The autonomic 3–2–1 homeostatic loop's problem is absorbed for solution within the autonomy of its metasystem. Development (the System 4 role of research and marketing) is asked for recommendations.\n\nIf more resources are required System 5 has to make the decision on which is the best option from System 4. Escalation to higher management (up the metalinguistic levels of recursion) will be needed if the remedy requires more resources than the current level of capability or variety can sustain. The pleasure of an algedonic alert which are performance improving innovations can also be handled in this way.\n\nIn a small business all these functions might be done by one person or shared between the participants. In larger enterprises roles can differentiate and become more specialized emphasizing one or more aspects of the VSM. Local conditions, the environment and nature of the service or product, determines where warehousing, sales, advertising, promotion, dispatch, taxation, finance, salaries etc., fit into this picture. Not all enterprises charge for their transactions (e.g. some schools and medical services, policing) and voluntary staff may not be paid. Advertising or shipping might not be part of the business or they might be the principal activity. Whatever the circumstances, all enterprises are required to be useful to their users if they are to remain viable. For all participants the central question remains: \"Do I do what I always do for this transaction or do I innovate?\" It is embodied in the calls on System 4. The VSM describes the constraints: a knowledge of past performance and how it may be improved.\n\nBeer dedicated _Brain of the Firm_ to his colleagues past and present with the words \" _absolutum obsoletum_\" which he translated as \"If it works it's out of date\".\n\nThe VSM was extensively applied in Latin America during the 1980s and 1990s, in particular in Uruguay and Colombia[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_note-15)\n\n## See also\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viable_system_model&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit section: See also\")\\]\n\n- [American Society for Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_for_Cybernetics \"American Society for Cybernetics\")\n- [Autonomous agency theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_agency_theory \"Autonomous agency theory\")\n- [Business model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model \"Business model\")\n- [Cybernetics Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics_Society \"Cybernetics Society\")\n- [Dynamic governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_governance \"Dynamic governance\")\n- [Project Cybersyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn \"Project Cybersyn\")\n- [Self-organization § Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization#Cybernetics \"Self-organization\")\n- [Viable system theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_theory \"Viable system theory\")\n\n## References\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viable_system_model&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: References\")\\]\n\n01. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_ref-1 \"Jump up\")**_Brain of the Firm_, Beer Allen Lane, 1972.\n02. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_ref-2 \"Jump up\")**_Brain of the Firm_, 2nd Edition, Pg 155.\n03. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_ref-3 \"Jump up\")**_Brain of the Firm_, 2nd Edition, Pg 167.\n04. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_ref-4 \"Jump up\")**_Brain of the Firm_, 2nd Edition, Pg 181.\n05. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_ref-5 \"Jump up\")**_Brain of the Firm_, 2nd Edition, Pg 201.\n06. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_ref-6 \"Jump up\")**_Brain of the Firm_ Chapters 6 and 7.\n07. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_ref-7 \"Jump up\")**Beer, Wiley 1979.\n08. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model#cite_ref-8 \"Jump up\")**Stafford., Beer (1985).

This is no easy task. Venkatesh Rao, spent an entire [series of essays](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/on-lore?s=r) exploring this topic. And Other Internet has put out [two great essays](https://otherinter.net/research/lore/) on the subject. Yet, the meaning of the word remains murky. Perhaps it's no accident—an instance of functional ambiguity—the multifaceted nature of the word preserving its potency. This is fitting because lore is deeply entangled with judgment, narrative, patterns, and instruction. To understand lore will require seeing how and why people make use these qualities to accomplish goals.\n\nWhen judgment, or narrative come up in the context of digital networks, the conversation often goes one of two directions. The first is to identify the lack of common context on social media, noting the confusion and contention that emerges from this kind of discourse. The second is to note that knowledge communities tend to cloister themselves on discord or within other private, semi-private settings. Often the first observation will be followed by the second. This makes sense—both statements are inherently connected, expressing the two sides of group knowledge problems.\n\nThis is the paradox of information technology. Access to information does not necessarily make it meaningful. Shared context, histories, patterns, and systems of symbols are required to provide a meaningful context that enables information to be transformed into knowledge. But these things are fragile, contextual, and often opaque. The transparency of information technology writes Haridimos Tsoukas is \"illusory.\" [1](https://enchanted.network/working-with-lore/discursive-landscapes#user-content-fn-1) He describes how complete transparency undermines the formation of what he calls expert systems, or closely attuned bodies of group knowledge, to effectively operate. He continues, writing:\n\n> An expert system cannot be made fully transparent for all to see its workings; there is no detached Olympian high ground from which it may be inspected. Transparency inevitably presupposes a subject: transparent to whom? If this question is raised, one realizes that what the outsiders see (and the significance they attach to what they see) is not the same as what the insiders see (and the significance they attach to their experiences). [1](https://enchanted.network/working-with-lore/discursive-landscapes#user-content-fn-1)\n\nInformation in public becomes contentious and is subject to conflicting sets of assumptions and contextualization. In contrast, expert systems utilize shared experience, context, and intent to frame information in a way that is meaningful. In other words, this shared context enables the development of group knowledge. However a trade-off is required. To promote the coherence of this shared context, a distinction is required, meaning expert systems are less permeable.\n\nIn [How to Read the Internet notes](https://otherinter.net/research/lore/how-to-read-the-internet/) Libby Marrs and Tiger Dingsun succinctly capture this phenomenon. They describe \"Loss\", a meme, that plays with the divergence that happens when one group begins to make a distinction that others do not. Knowledge of Loss instills both a sensitivity to the patterns that characterize the meme, while also providing knowledge about how to make use of these patterns to generate new permutations. In this way it is possible to imagine the meme as \"a cloud of ancestral nodes connected by branching paths. Each branch encodes the process of copying, editing, and re-contextualizing that produces a new version of the meme.\" [2](https://enchanted.network/working-with-lore/discursive-landscapes#user-content-fn-2)\n\nLoss establishes a pattern which makes certain kinds of data meaningful. The pattern is not hard to learn, as demonstrated by popularity of the meme. Yet at the same time, what makes the meme funny is the knowledge that most people seeing the image will not draw the same significance from it. For this reason, the more remote the connection, and the more abstract the image, the better the meme becomes. And yet the meme remains entirely legible to people who can read the pattern. This is because meaning is derived from all previous encounters with examples of this pattern, drawing distinctions in the context of memory and experiences in communities of like minded individuals. Marrs and Dingsun write:\n\n> This communal meaning-making through cycles of abstraction and concretization is the oil in the machine of language itself. In conditions where more knowledge remains embodied in memory than in written archives, there’s a greater need for modular linguistic fragments that signify highly situational, nuanced meaning. [2](https://enchanted.network/working-with-lore/discursive-landscapes#user-content-fn-2)\n\nOften the ability to detect patterns is associated with expertise. For many areas of expertise, there is no substitute for gaining embodied experience which serves as the foundation for correctly ascribing meaning to information. In much the same way that a person learns to \"diagnose\" the pattern of loss in an image, so too does a medical student in residency learn to diagnose a clump of cells visualized by MRI. while the stakes are significantly higher, it is through repeated exposure to different manifestations of the pattern, in combination with observations of patient health outcomes, and input from expert practitioners that the medical student is able to derive a nuanced judgment about the observed patterns.\n\nThis gets a key characteristic of lore. Lore helps enable communication about the meaning making that provides the basis for judgment. Lore establishes patterns that aid people in ascribing significance to data and articulating that significance to others, often in contexts where memory and experience are key.\n\nMaking the right judgment can be challenging, especially when there's a lot at stake. This is one reason why organizations develop. Organizations help people navigate information problems and provide frameworks to facilitate the passage of judgment. Organizations also help to distribute the risk involved in decision making. [3](https://enchanted.network/working-with-lore/discursive-landscapes#user-content-fn-3)\n\nPeople in organizations need to be able to make decisions in the face of uncertainty, and make judgments about the risks involved that are informed by the knowledge they posses. In many organizations, this takes on a specific form. In Narrative Construction as Sensemaking: How a Central Bank Thinks, Mitchel Abolafia stresses that judgment is arrived at through the collective process of narrative craft:\n\n> Narrative construction begins with the selection and interpretation of facts. These facts are not so much given by the situation, but rather chosen from an accessible, conventionalized repertoire of indicators because they seem resonant and appropriate in the current circumstances. But selection of a conventionalized set of indicators alone is an inchoate form of explanation. These indicators offer inadequate causal accounts for the positive or negative conditions in the environment. As the ‘facts’ are assembled in the early part of the meeting, we begin to see members’ efforts to impose explanatory order on them. [4](https://enchanted.network/working-with-lore/discursive-landscapes#user-content-fn-4)\n\nHe continues writing: \"Narrative enables the interpreter to explain the misfit between facts and models. It clarifies discrepancies and fills in absent complexities. Most importantly, it specifies ‘tempo, duration, and pace’ of narrative elements [4](https://enchanted.network/working-with-lore/discursive-landscapes#user-content-fn-4)\" Narrative structure provide a method to establish agreement about what patterns are being observed. It enables people to chart connective lines between observations. It facilitates a process of establishing next steps, and finally articulates the manner in which those next steps will be undertaken.\n\nThis points to the next feature of lore. It enables communication about meaning making, providing basis for judgment, while also supplying structures and strategies to determine how and in what manner to put these judgments to work. Lore helps order insights and transform them into operationalizable pathways. Lore enables the application of patterns of meaning making, and patterns of activity.\n\nThis corresponds closely to Christopher Alexander's idea of pattern languages. [5](https://enchanted.network/working-with-lore/discursive-landscapes#user-content-fn-5) When building a cathedral, Alexander says that the structure is first built in language. The conversations of the masons and carpenters, speaking in common patterns, approach key judgments and apply these insights to the specific contexts on the challenges they face. In this way, the structure emerges out of the language of all involved. Alexander goes further. For him a pattern language not only facilitates common understanding, and decision making, they also serve to coordinate the work of people towards a shared goal\n\n> There were hundreds of people, each making his part within the whole, working, often for generations. At any given moment there was usually one master builder, who directed the overall layout... but each person in the whole had, in his mind, the same overall language. Each person executed each detail in the same general way, but but with minor differences. The master builders did not need to force design of the details down the builders' throats, because the builders themselves knew enough of the shared pattern language to make the details correctly, with their own individual flair. [5](https://enchanted.network/working-with-lore/discursive-landscapes#user-content-fn-5)\n\nWorking semi-autonomously, holding a shared set of patterns enabled the builders to \"run\" the project in their head, acting in conjunction with the others involved in the project and approach the problem space with the same intention. When this happens the shared goals are emergent within the patterns of activity themselves.\n\nAlexander, adds one more quality to the language of people building together. He stresses the importance of that language being grounded in a life beyond the professional world. \"First to be living as a language, it must be the shared vision of a group of people, very specific to their culture, able to capture their hopes and dreams, containing many childhood memories, and special local ways of doing things, \" [5](https://enchanted.network/working-with-lore/discursive-landscapes#user-content-fn-5) Alexander makes a special point to identify the fact that this language is rooted in a constellation of people—that it emerges from community.\n\nThis provides two more clues about the nature of lore. Lore enables communication about meaning making, providing basis for judgment, while also supplying structures and strategies to determine how and in what manner to put these judgments to work. Lore also give people insight into how their work connects to the work of others and situates this within a network of people, culture and cosmology.\n\nThis fits with the work of Venkatesh Rao. When describing lore, Rao writes, in its raw form, lore \"is all the competing mental models for effective action going around, under conditions of imperfect knowledge. Lore is some mix of received wisdom you opt-in (or buy in) to, lazy imitation, and some original thought and ideation.\" [6](https://enchanted.network/working-with-lore/discursive-landscapes#user-content-fn-6) He adds to this, identifying that lore is an \"aggregate of all these molecules, across all individuals.\" [6](https://enchanted.network/working-with-lore/discursive-landscapes#user-content-fn-6)\n\nPutting all these pieces together, it's clear what lore does, yet it still remains illusive. Lore is a nebulous linguistic landscape of aesthetics, narratives, and patterns held within the minds of many people. Lore is the substance of effective communications. It is the connective tissue of people working towards common goals. While lore can be put to work, as Alexander Pitsis writes, it has \"the characteristic of belonging to the amorphous levels of human consciousness, such as sleep and dreams.\" [7](https://enchanted.network/working-with-lore/discursive-landscapes#user-content-fn-7)\n\nTo get a handle for lore requires looking at how it is manifest in specific contexts. This does not get at the substance of raw lore itself, but rather requires looking at the artifacts that lore has produced. In an organization, these may consist of:\n\n1. **Categories**. Categories are built on top of lore. These can include moral categories that shape the values of the organization. They can also include the ontologies which operate within an organization. Together these frame information and help to shape data that enters an organization, contextualizing it in a meaningful way. Categories can also describe the information architecture of an organization, framing how documents and work are organized. Similarly categories inform the creation of KPMs, defining what information is collected and how it is interpreted.\n2. **Origin Stories** Lore informs the creation of origins stories. The events of founding an organization, or partners meeting happen on their own, but they enter the domain of lore when framed in a narrative structure that articulate the goals and aspirations of the organization, establishes patterns of work and connects to the life stories of contributors to the organization.\n3. **Roles** Lore shapes roles, defining responsibilities, building mental models of the job to be done, and helping to coordinate the work of autonomous contributors. Lore can enable people to run the role virtually in their head, or take on another role when needed based on the patterns and narratives they have absorbed. Lore also plays a role helping people to understand the responsibilities and expectations of their position, making them more reliable within the context of the organization. Moreover, lore enables people to speak within a history of practitioners. Often this element becomes invisible, but the lore is manifest in the specific vocabulary of a domain, and sometimes emerges when justification is required, citing stories, experience, principals or thinkers which have shaped their practice.\n4. **Documents** Lore facilitates the passage of judgment, by providing frameworks for how choices are advocated for and decided upon. Lore becomes froze in document such as memos, drawing upon categories, origin stories, common goals, roles, and histories of practice within an organization to make an argument within a specific context.\n\nLore can become manifest in many different ways. For instance, the categories of an organization may find expression in the channels of a discord server. Or a key point of thinking may be expressed in a meme. But to focus on the end form is to miss the dynamic process happening beneath the surface. Lore is something that happens. Its application is emergent and discursive.\n\nStepping into web3 lore presents two significant challenges. 1. horizontal organizations have specific coordination problems to solve which requires putting lore to work in specific ways. 2. Default to writing indicates a fundamental shift has taken place. The domain of lore has migrated from the spoken language to the written language. These two facts have huge ramifications. The next segment will explore these qualities in detail.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. Tsoukas, Haridimos. Complex Knowledge: Studies in Organizational Epistemology. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005.

[The Future of Work](https://enchanted.network/working-with-lore/the-future-of-work)\n2. [Discursive Landscapes](https://enchanted.network/working-with-lore/discursive-landscapes)\n3. Who's in control? Organizational Topology\n4. Knowledge Comes From Narrative\n5. Narratives and Virtual Roles\n6. Towers of Babel\n7. The Job of Ambiguity\n8. The Johnny Appleseed Highway\n\n- [WORKING WITH LORE](https://enchanted.network/working-with-lore)\n- → [THE FUTURE OF WORK](https://enchanted.network/working-with-lore/the-future-of-work)\n\n> One day the mariners’ collective imagination perceives the spectre of the Flying Dutchman on the oceans of the new world: ‘blood red the sails, black the mast’. Aimlessly, the helm damaged or washed away, and every now and then without a living crew, it haunts the floods—a gloomy memorial in an optimistic age—and it dooms those crossing its way with a curse of aimlessness and life-in-death.\n>\n> The Flying Dutchman. 1826\n\nWork is changing. More people are collaborating remotely than ever before. This trend started before Covid, and while some organizations want to bring people back into the office, its clear that the cat is out of the bag. This has unfolded in parallel with advances in communications technology. From humble improvements in software that make collaboration easier, to profound breakthroughs in value infrastructure that enable groups to collectively own and manage capital, the result has been a proliferation of novel organizational forms. [DAOs](https://blog.aragon.org/a-dao-defined-the-big-picture/) are managing large pools of capital and stewarding significant protocol. [Platform co-ops](https://platform.coop/) are gaining tractions. Even some legacy institutions are [making the leap](https://medium.com/the-ready/the-operating-system-canvas-420b8b4df062), reorganizing themselves into horizontal and distributed forms.\n\nThis explosion of organizational creativity comes hand-in-hand with a promise to solve the biggest [workplace challenges](https://www.quorumnewsletter.xyz/the-birth-of-the-shortened-dao-workday-and-the-death-of-email-jobs/). Imagine, being able to detach earning potential from location, achieving better project fit with a more divergent, diverse pool of contributors, or being able to allocate work more efficiently by empowering people to organically join in as needed. All of this is within sight. While these aspirations drive organizations, the actual contributor experience does not always hit the mark.\n\nIt's no secret, distributed organizations are young. The technology which supports their operations is in its infancy. Breaking the patterns of legacy organizations takes time. Plus we're still discovering the possibilities inherent in these new organizational forms.\n\nIn the midst of uncertainty, one thing is clear: people, especially online, are animated by an [illusive thing called lore](https://otherinter.net/research/lore/9999/). Lore [unlocks the potential](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/lands-of-lorecraft?s=r) of distributed teams, but putting it to work is difficult. This is because lore resides at an individual level, and exists as separate yet synchronous mental models, and systems of symbols. Despite its ambiguity, lore is foundational for distributed organizations, establishing an ongoing aesthetic and narrative framework that promotes the creation of group knowledge, enables effective decision-making, and improves the coordination of autonomous actors.\n\nWe are primed to leverage lore. The remote workplace is already a landscape of language. Communication lives in the chat room. The mantra for many is \"default to writing.\" Lore is constantly being built—the challenge is to carve out space, celebrate, and elevate lore within our tool stacks and operational practices.\n\nThe need is urgent. Distributed organizations are [occupying mission critical niches](https://blog.aragon.org/who-will-build-the-next-10-000-daos/) that demand performance. At the same time, many of these organizations are struggling to deliver on the promises of the future of work. In the midst of a bear market, the challenges of growing a contributor base means that making the future of work _work_ is no longer a compelling experiment, but a matter of survival.\n\nZooming out, our challenges are profound. This is a moment of narrative collapse. As we face problems at a planetary scale, establishing common cause is illusive. When exploring the challenges of coordination, the outcry for [better narrative infrastructure](https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-note-8-on-art-and-imagination-infrastructure-8b3cee1d32c6) often follows. We have the ability to leverage this opportunity, but only if we recognize that the new organizational forms emerging from web3 and beyond are not just as vessels for the shared stewardship of capital but also the lore that gives meaning to our work on this earth.\n\nIn part two of this series, I'll explore the nature of organizations and how they coordinate work by helping people solve information problems. I'll contextualize this with a brief historical overview of organizational control methodologies. This will lay the stage for an examination of the characteristics of distributed organizations, demonstrating why lore plays a critical role in horizontal coordination problems.\n\nRead More\n\n### Discursive Landscapes\n\nGet Updates\n\nYour subscription could not be saved.

The impetus was the design of a new funding program— _Activate—_ which flows resources to feminist funds, supporting their capacities to move money to their own networks of partners.\n\nAs a feminist fund, the Equality Fund considers itself a proud part of this diverse community. We are peers of different sizes and trajectories, working in different geographies, at multiple levels and collectively organizing in different configurations and networks, including  [Prospera –  International Network of Women’s Funds](https://www.prospera-inwf.org/#!/-home/). For the design of the _Activate_ program, instead of replicating old grantmaking models rooted in scarcity and competition, we engaged with this vibrant community of peers to co-design a new approach. Together, we set out to build a non-competitive grantmaking model with feminist values of collaboration, solidarity, and community at the core. We called this model _Step Up/Step Back_.\n\nDuring the process, the feminist funds successfully considered the community’s resourcing  needs and priorities as they decided whether to step up for funding or to step back and wait for future rounds. In the end,  23 funds  stepped up to receive a total of $14 million CAD in flexible multi-year grants, while close to 50 percent of eligible funds decided to step back.\n\nThis report uncovers the lessons behind this journey. It details the process and co-development of _Step Up/Step Back_, shares the experiences of the funds that participated, and discusses some of the points of tension that arose in the process.\n\nThrough it all, a set of key learnings emerge:\n\n**A different way of making funding decisions is possible:** Nearly half of the eligible funds decided to step back from funding, after self assessing their position in the context of the broader community’s resourcing needs and priorities.\n\n**Building on existing networks is essential for trust and collaboration**: The _Step Up/Step Back_ model was possible thanks to years of community-building work led by Prospera – International Network of Women’s Funds and others in the feminist funding ecosystem.\n\n**Working with a trusted interlocutor is critical to success**: We greatly benefited from having a program lead that was a known and trusted member of the feminist funds community. The notion of voluntarily stepping back from funding may not have been met with as much openness without her deep ties and credibility in the community.\n\n**Ownership is a process and outcome**: Engagement of the feminist funds community from the onset and throughout the participatory process reinforced solidarity amongst the funds.\n\n**Collective power in decision-making results in outcomes that are representative of diversity in the community**: Taking a collective approach to deciding funding priorities  ultimately led to a diversity of funds receiving resources, including 10 national funds and seven funds founded less than five years ago.\n\n**Pushing the boundaries of existing funding parameters is key**: Our community continues to advocate for government funding that accommodates participatory grantmaking models and better meets the needs and realities of feminist movements globally.\n\n**Traditional definitions of risk are obstacles to feminist funding**: In order to robustly fund new and/or under-resourced feminist movements working in restrictive socio-political contexts, we need to expand risk analysis frameworks and focus on understanding the risk of _not_ being able to fund key feminist agents of change.\n\n### Continue Reading\n\n![](https://equalityfund.ca/wp-content/themes/sage/resources/assets/images/ef-gradient-arch.png)\n\n## Move with Us\n\n### Support the Equality Fund’s work **worldwide**\n\nAccelerate the power of women, girls, and trans people everywhere.\n\n[Donate Now](https://equalityfund.ca/donate-now/ \"Donate Now\")\n\n[Top](https://equalityfund.ca/grantmaking/step-up-step-back-reimagining-non-competitive-grantmaking-in-community/#top \"Skip to top\")",

Every day, we see how feminist movements are addressing the world’s biggest challenges—building durable, scalable solutions to seemingly intractable issues like inequality, climate change, and conflict.\n\nAt the very same time, we see how traditional approaches to philanthropy and development forfeit this potential from the start, keeping money and power at the top, starving feminist movements of the resources and agency they deserve to build the future we all need.\n\n**This blog expands on these main areas of the Equality Fund’s inclusive grantmaking work:**\n\n**Our inclusive grantmaking journey**\n\n**Our timeline**\n\n**Our top five takeaways**\n\nBy its very design, the Equality Fund is a challenge to this status quo. It is a collective promise to unlock capital to unleash the full power of feminist movements. Together, we are reimagining old approaches to philanthropy, investment, and government funding simultaneously, with a model that shifts sustainable and scalable resources to feminist movements for lifetimes to come.\n\nUltimately, shifting power is about much more than what we fund. It demands that we examine _how_ we resource movements, and how we can disrupt the colonial and patriarchal practices that continue to be so deeply entrenched in our field. It means moving beyond words to action—a willingness to experiment and co-create new approaches to governance and funding practices. And while we have so much more to figure out, we are committed to the journey, and to sharing what we are learning along the way.\n\n## Inclusive grantmaking\n\nWhen we envisioned and started the Equality Fund, we set out to honour a deeply held belief and commitment to solidarity, accountability, and transparency with movements. As we began the Equality Fund, we worked with the Association for Women’s Rights in Development ( [AWID](https://www.awid.org/)) to consult feminist activists globally.\n\nIn AWID’s report, [High Hopes and High Expectations for Resourcing Feminist Movements](https://www.awid.org/publications/high-hopes-and-high-expectations-resourcing-feminist-movements-recommendations-equality#:~:text=About%20the%20Equality%20Fund%20recommendations,to%20support%20feminist%20social%20change.), feminist movements highlighted the importance of inclusive grantmaking, with a priority on placing funding decisions in the hands of communities as a matter of both principle and efficacy. This echoes [current conversations in Canada](https://cooperation.ca/localize-or-perish/) that highlight\n\n> The importance of abandoning the ethnocentric and imperialist practices whereby donors and experts from the global North impose questionable solutions to historically disadvantaged and donor-dependent countries and communities.\n\nListening and responding to these conversations, it was clear from the outset that the Equality Fund would use a community-informed strategy to ensure the necessary power shifts could take place to support a global move towards more decolonized philanthropy and funding.\n\nOver the course of eight months, we designed and implemented a community-informed process to make participatory grantmaking decisions in our inaugural _Catalyze_ grants program. Through a [dynamic partnership](https://equalityfund.ca/grantmaking/equality-fund-awdf/) between the African Women’s Development Fund ( [AWDF](https://awdf.org/)) and Equality Fund, AWDF led a call for proposals across the African continent, ultimately selecting 42 grassroots feminist organizations for funding. The Equality Fund led a call across Asia, the Pacific, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, selecting 30 new grantee partners. Together, the 72 grants total $4,365,632. [Read more about our grantee partners here.](https://equalityfund.ca/what-we-do/grantmaking/our-grantee-partners/)\n\nFor Equality Fund’s selection of the 30 new grantee partners, we worked with a [Global Advisory Panel](https://equalityfund.ca/grantmaking/announcing-our-catalyze-global-advisory-panel/)—a group of ten feminist leaders supporting our decision-making process by providing recommendations and insights on selecting our new cohort.\n\nThe following infographic outlines our step-by-step timeline—unpacking how we implemented our first participatory grantmaking process and highlighting the key elements and principles needed to deliver it in line with our feminist values.\n\n## Our Timeline\n\n![](https://equalityfund.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/EN-EF-CIP-Infographic-jpg-scaled-2.jpg)\n\n## Our top five takeaways\n\nIn addition to documenting and sharing our overall process, we want to share some of the deeper elements of how we lived through it, what we gained from it, and what we take forward as lessons learned. Here are our top five learnings and takeaways gathered through reflective conversations with team members across the Fund.\n\n### A Fund shows its values and intentions, not by how it speaks, but by how and who it funds.\n\nWhen building the Equality Fund, we were intentional about moving beyond messages that are increasingly common in our sector toward real action. We pushed ourselves to _do_ the right things with integrity and intention, even as we continued to learn. Feminist philanthropy is a political act which seeks to challenge and transform notions of power, privilege, and resources. Our model aims to meet the moment we are in—putting funds directly in the hands of women, girls, youth, and gender non-binary leaders pushing for equality, justice, and transformation rather than superficial or short-term responses.\n\nCreating the [Global Advisory Panel](https://equalityfund.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Equality-Funds-Global-Advisory-Panel-Bios.docx.pdf)(GAP) of ten exceptional feminist leaders was one of the most critical manifestations of our commitment. This Panel and our core community played an instrumental role in ensuring that feminist accountability was at the heart of our approach—staying true to inclusive grantmaking, community-informed strategies, and our [Principles for Feminist Funding.](https://equalityfund.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Feminist-Philanthropy-EN.pdf)\n\nFurther, we ensured that the creation of the GAP was not just about ticking a box—but a meaningful experience. We endeavoured to create a sense of community by getting to know each other and supporting one another as we live through these unprecedented times (and unstable internet connections). We continue to learn from this first round and know where we can improve and refine our approach from the feedback submitted by panellists and consultants.\n\nThanks to the GAP, we are proud to have selected the 30 diverse groups working on interconnecting issues of racial justice, the rights of Indigenous women, precarious workers, migrant workers, the needs of refugees and displaced women, as well as sexual and reproductive health and rights. [Read about these courageous groups here.](https://equalityfund.ca/what-we-do/grantmaking/our-grantee-partners/)\n\n### Involving communities in decision-making is not a binary. It is a spectrum.\n\nIn principle, participatory grantmaking is gaining new momentum and attention in philanthropy. However, funders are still largely uncertain about how to make participatory grantmaking happen in practice and are hesitant to try for fear of making mistakes. This is how we felt too. But we decided that the stakes were too high not to begin, even if we would need to move incrementally and continue to learn in real-time. We dove in and launched the _Catalyze_ grants program, stating our intention to use a community-informed strategy to make decisions.\n\nThe pressure to deliver on our intention was heightened by the urgent context of the pandemic. Furthermore, we had to acknowledge that our rapid growth and the structure required to manage bilateral funds presented limitations. Taking this all into account, we opted for an advisory panel model that would enable us to involve the community and leverage collective expertise to make informed decisions within a specific timeframe and manageable structure. We continue to aspire towards deepened participatory models in the future as used by our peers, like [FRIDA](https://youngfeministfund.org/), but also recognize we are on a journey—and embrace the notion that there are many paths towards participatory grantmaking.\n\n### It would be a failure as a global North Fund to not be accountable to the movements we serve in the global South.\n\nFor too long, philanthropy and global development have sought out ‘silver bullet’ approaches that promise systems change from the top down. Yet many years and many billions of dollars later, lasting change has remained elusive. What is needed instead is deep dialogue and accountability with communities and movements: the very people who live closest to the challenges and who hold the most promising solutions to them. Our community-informed approach is one of the many ways we honour our commitment to offering an alternative to funding approaches of the past—one that honours and uplifts the wisdom of movements and communities as the key catalyst for lasting change in millions of lives.\n\nCOVID-19 measures including lockdowns, interruptions of international travel, and social distancing highlighted that the international system—despite being well-resourced and large in scale—was not the best positioned to respond to the crisis. Rather, local groups and movements were ready to respond and address their communities’ needs. This is not new. In the face of crisis, local grassroots groups hold the deepest relationships and know exactly how to take action to support their communities. It would only make sense to seek the expertise of these groups to inform our grantmaking.\n\nSome might refer to this as localization, but for us, involving feminist leaders from those communities in our decision-making means the design of the solution and its impact rest within the community. Over time, and as we build trust with partners, we are building a deeper knowledge of how things are shifting and changing—and this means we can respond proactively and appropriately in real time.\n\n### We have the opportunity to rewrite the rules on risk—and ensure we are in solidarity with global movements.\n\nBeyond our fiduciary responsibility, our relationships to feminist movements push us to think about and manage risk with more nuance and accountability. How do we acknowledge the risks that our grantee partners take every day in their work pushing for transformative change? What is the risk of not funding this work? In the corporate world, taking risks is deemed necessary and often rewarded—so why not be bold as funders?\n\nWe know that having communities support our decision-making is crucial. Input from locally-led groups and movements better informs and prepares us in our grantmaking—much better than we ever could accomplish from our perspective in the global North alone.\n\n### Authenticity is powerful when sharing learnings as a funder to encourage honest and transformative conversations.\n\nWe have learned to practise progress, not perfection. In reality, participatory processes are not just a way to make decisions about funding, but an experience of transforming how we practice power. We believe funders can and must include communities in the decision-making process. We also know that this approach is not easy and requires space to try, to fail, to learn, and to reimagine.\n\nIt was not always easy but we have made progress—in our own authentic way—with deep listening alongside our advisors, our community, and amongst each other. And we know how much further we have to go, together. Ultimately, involving our community in our decision-making always centres on accountability, transparency, and keeping true to who we are. And it is here to stay.\n\n_Thank you to Devi Leiper O’Malley and Swatee Deepak for leading and collating reflective conversations with Wariri Muhungi, Remie Abi-Farrage, Marine-Celeste Kiromera, Sue Snider, Beth Woroniuk, Jess Tomlin, Katy Love, and Ruby Johnson._\n\n**REPORT** – [Emerging Reflections from the Global Advisory Panel

Park Ave, Bloomington, IN**\n\n# OSTROM Workshop \\| Colloquium Series: Dr. Sonja Amadae\n\nThe Ostrom Workshop welcomes Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research Affiliate Aalto University Researcher, and the University of Helsinki Lecturer Dr Sonja Amadae\n\n### Polycentric Climate Governance Applying Anti-Rival sNFT Cryptocurrency Tokens\n\nS.M. Amadae, Shreya Sood, and Ruta Jumite\n\n##### ![S.M. Amadae](https://events.iu.edu/live/image/gid/105/width/268/height/300/12825_Amadae_268x300.jpg)S.M. Amadae\n\nThis paper provides a theoretical argument for and extension of Ostrom’s polycentric governance tools to achieve sustainable use of common pool resources to encompass the proliferation of anti-rival value. Additionally we report on our pilot use case’s experimental implementation of this institutional design deploying anti-rival cryptocurrency tokens. We build a virtual community through an app which functions to provide anti-rival information about the environmental impact of cafeteria meal choices to university students. We treat the environmental tragedy of the commons associated with runaway Green House Gas (GHG) emissions as a negligibility problem. We treat positive externalities of low impact meal choices as anti-rival: the more sustainable meal choices made, the more likely collective impact can be significant. Using blockchain distributed ledger technology, we develop an anti-rival accounting system that measures, records, and rewards sustainable meal choices. Our approach bridges between Ostrom’s governance for common pool resources and the cap and trade system for offsetting GHG emissions. Using parallel environmental cost estimates, we show how as increasing numbers of citizen-consumers may opt in to join similar virtual communities, they will be empowered to have measurable environmental impact. Ultimately this positive collective impact can be reinforced by external sponsors, or tax credits.\n\n**About the Colloquium Series**\n\nEach Monday throughout the academic year, speakers share and discuss cutting edge research echoing the themes of the Ostrom Workshop’s research program.

It struck both wonder and terror into my heart.\n\nI felt ecstatic that computers could finally talk back to me. But I also felt a heavy sense of dread. [I’m a writer](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/admitting-what-is-obvious)—what would happen to me?\n\nWe’ve all had this experience with AI over the last year and a half. It is an emotional rollercoaster. It feels like it threatens our conception of ourselves.\n\nWe’ve long defined the difference between humans and animals by our ability to think. Aristotle wrote: “The life of the intellect is the best and pleasantest for man, for the intellect more than anything else is man; therefore, a life guided by intellect is the best for man.”\n\nTwo thousand years later, the playwright and short story author Anton Chekhov agreed in his novella, _Ward No. 6_: “Intellect draws a sharp line between the animals and man, \\[and\\] suggests the divinity of the latter.”\n\nThe primacy of thinking and the intellect as _the_ feature by which we define ourselves has become even more salient as we’ve moved from an economy driven by industrial labor into one driven by knowledge. Indeed, if you’re reading this, you probably put a lot of stock into what you know. After all, that’s what knowledge work is all about. If we define ourselves and our value this way, it’s no wonder LLMs seem scary.\n\nIf AI can now write, and, worse, think, what’s left that makes humans unique?\n\nI think LLMs will change knowledge work. In doing so, they’ll change how we think of ourselves, and which characteristics we deem uniquely human. But these days I’m not particularly scared. In fact, I’m mostly filled with excitement.\n\nMy sense of self has changed—and that’s a good thing. ChatGPT has made me see my intellect and role in the creative process differently than I did before. It doesn’t replace me; it just changes what I do. It’s possible to achieve this feeling of excitement by 1) getting a clearer conception of what LLMs actually do and don’t do, and 2) expanding your view of what you are and what you are capable of.\n\nLet’s talk about what that looks like. To start, we have to understand what the intellect is.\n\n## What is the intellect?\n\nFor the purposes of this article, the intellect is the thing that humans uniquely have that animals don’t. This is a fuzzy definition, by design. It reflects what feels threatened by AI: that which makes us human.\n\nIn reality, the intellect is a gigantic combination of brain processes that look like thinking. Thinking, the intellect, the mind—these are all different processes that we lump under a single heading. That’s why it’s easier to define it _via negativa_, by what it is not—it’s whatever animals don’t do. (We now know that animals _do_ have thinking processes that look a lot like what we might call intellect, but that hasn’t filtered into our popular conceptions of self. Read Frans de Waal’s classic book, [_Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?_](https://www.amazon.com/Are-Smart-Enough-Know-Animals/dp/0393353664), for an excellent overview of animal intelligence.)\n\nOur fuzzy definition of the intellect is why our first encounter with ChatGPT and its ilk can be so terrifying. It touches a lightning rod within us. For millennia we’ve set ourselves apart by a strange, amorphous, many-dimensional thing called intelligence—and suddenly there is something encroaching on our turf. Because it can do some of the things we associate with the intellect, we feel both excited, because we’re no longer alone, and threatened—because we might be replaceable.\n\nIn order to regain our sense of self and place in the world, we need to redefine what we mean by “intellect.” We need to create a new sense of separation between what humans do and what AI can do. We need to redefine “intellect” so as to make it work in an AI-driven world.\n\nFortunately, we’ve done this before, and technology can help.\n\nPsychology is a branch of science that is _full_ of concepts that are fuzzy in the same way the “intellect” is. Take depression and bi-polar disorder. Neither is detected by a blood test, or even has a consistent set of symptoms. Instead, they’re characterized as syndromes: a set of often associated symptoms that can vary from case to case.\n\nThe problem is that there are significant overlaps between depression and bipolar disorder that can both manifest as low mood. As late as the 1960s, depression and bipolar disorder were lumped together under a single heading and understood to have a similar underlying cause. But it turns out that technology—specifically, the discovery of the drug lithium—was the key ingredient that we needed to pull them apart.\n\nIt all started with guinea pigs.\n\n## Pharmacological dissection of mental illness\n\nIn the late 1940s, a doctor named J.F. Cade, who apparently had entirely too much time on his hands, discovered that the urine of manic patients was toxic to guinea pigs. (I can’t believe I just typed that sentence, but, like, we all have our kinks, I guess.)\n\n[![](https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2918/optimized_zGqQXtGWf71Lda95M0EgQDMay2u4itHED4ydJGZZ09-vF3q8UWRXmwFzBOgcAxwFczMBz1BWNjUMBL4hMHENFEc-WlE8qvo7NpGXObgPrJaZGQgvHcQH1WTTPYtr.png)](https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2918/optimized_zGqQXtGWf71Lda95M0EgQDMay2u4itHED4ydJGZZ09-vF3q8UWRXmwFzBOgcAxwFczMBz1BWNjUMBL4hMHENFEc-WlE8qvo7NpGXObgPrJaZGQgvHcQH1WTTPYtr.png)\n\n_Do not let this man around your guinea pigs. Source: Wikipedia._\n\nAnyway, Cade set out to find out why. He discovered that manic patients had elevated levels of uric acid in their pee and thought that might be what was causing the toxicity. He decided to perform a controlled experiment on the guinea pigs: He would inject them with varying levels of uric acid to see if increasing levels would cause toxicity.\n\nTo do the injections, he dissolved the uric acid into a lithium carbonate solution. When he injected the guinea pigs with lithium he noticed that they became remarkably calm. They just sat around in their cages and didn’t respond to being messed around with—a side effect he had not anticipated.\n\nThen, in a move that revolutionized the field of psychology, Cade decided to inject the lithium carbonate into his manic patients. The results were astonishing: Lithium resolved their mania.\n\nThis is a remarkable series of events for two reasons: One, it resulted in a drug, lithium, that has saved many thousands of lives over the decades since it was discovered. And two, it acted as what the psychiatrist Peter Kramer calls a “pharmacological dissection” that differentiated manic depression as a separate disease from depression, with its own biological cause.\n\nKramer argued that manic depression hadn’t previously been thought of as separate from depression. Indeed, psychoanalytic thought, which was the prevailing model of the mind at the time, viewed all psychiatric issues as essentially about internal psychological conflicts resulting from childhood trauma.\n\nBut a drug, lithium—which cured manic depression, and only manic depression—helped carve the disease out as distinct from the rest of mental illness, and one that was fundamentally biological in origin. In other words, lithium was a lever that became a new lens on the way our minds work.\n\nWe can use this model to do a similar technological dissection on our intellect. Once we understand what ChatGPT does, it can help us further define and flesh out our previously fuzzy concepts like the intellect—while leaving our sense of what keeps us different intact.\n\n## ChatGPT is a summarizer\n\nTechnically, ChatGPT does next token prediction. Given a string of words, it is very good at statistically predicting the most likely words that come next in the sequence.\n\nIn practice, that means that ChatGPT and other LLMs are _incredible_ at reformatting, reconstituting, and recombining old knowledge in new and useful ways. The cognitive scientist Alison Gopnik and colleagues [refer to LLMs as technologies](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17456916231201401) that enhance “cultural transmission” and are “powerful and efficient imitation engines.”\n\nIn this way, Gopnik argues, LLMs are an extension of previously existing technologies like writing, the printing press, and the internet. They allow existing information to be “passed efficiently from one group of people to another,” which allows for “a new means of cultural production and evolution.”\n\nWhat this means, in effect, is that LLMs aren’t very good at discovering new things thus far. But they _are_ incredible at bringing to bear human knowledge into any given area of inquiry, by effectively compressing and reformatting it in precisely the best way for it to be consumed. Its powers for increasing transmission and understanding of knowledge are better by far than any preceding innovation, from the book to the internet.\n\nTo say it plainly: These things are great at summarizing. Calling ChatGPT a summarizer might sound pejorative, but it’s not. It is powerful and important. Because the sum total of all human knowledge far outstrips any single person’s ability to remember it, we _need_ LLMs in order to have any hope of enacting all of the things humanity knows.\n\nThinking about ChatGPT as a summarizer, we can now come back to the word that started us off—”intellect”—and see how it might help us refine our understanding of our intellect, and ourselves.\n\n## A technological dissection of ‘intellect’\n\nHere’s what happened when I started to see ChatGPT as a summarizer.\n\nFirst, I started to see that summaries are happening everywhere, all the time. Most of the emails I write are summaries, and so is most of the code I write. Even much of this article is a summary. For example, the passage about J. F. Cade, lithium, and pharmacological dissection is a summary of a particularly enlightening section of Peter Kramer’s book, _Listening to Prozac_.\n\nAt this point, it’s easy for me to again panic and start to feel threatened. If summaries are everywhere in my work life, and ChatGPT can do summaries, what role do I have? The answer is obvious: There’s a large amount of things that need to be done to write a great essay. The fact that I don’t have to summarize as much is _fantastic._\n\nWhen I really sat down to think about this article, the interesting thing, the hard thing, was not the summary. It was everything else that went into it: the life experience, the diversity of reading sources, the emotional journey of interacting with ChatGPT and considering its implications. Summarizing skills are a kind of creative drudgery. I learned them out of necessity, but they’re no longer as useful as they once were.\n\nOnce I start thinking this way, I start to automatically subtract summarizing as a skill that’s core to my sense of identity, humaneness, and intellect. It feels much more “okay” that ChatGPT is able to do this—because now I get to direct it to summarize for me. I can summarize many more things in a day now, with far less effort, so it increases my writing productivity.\n\nMy sense of self, having suffered the loss of summary, heals pretty quickly as soon as I realize that much richness remains. In fact, the loss of summary highlights the richness that I might not have seen otherwise. ChatGPT is a lever that becomes a new lens on what my intellect is—and what my role in the creative process should be.\n\nA key point is that this doesn’t have to be specifically about summarizing. If ChatGPT had been good at finding out new knowledge and terrible at summarizing, I would instead extol the virtues of my human ability to summarize. This is good and natural: Humans, above all, are adaptable. I define what’s interesting by what I can uniquely do. That’s a human process at work. And our adaptability is the thing we miss when we freak out about AI and ChatGPT.\n\nSure, it is an important fact that many jobs require a lot of summarizing, and that those jobs will change dramatically, or may no longer exist. Our society will do better if we face that head on, and take care of the people who will need to learn new skills or find new roles in the economy.\n\nBut this has nothing to do with our underlying sense of self or what makes humans unique in the universe. That can still be left slightly changed, but intact in a world with LLMs. This has happened before.\n\n## Technology has been changing our brains for generations\n\nIn his book [_The WEIRDest People in the World_](https://www.amazon.com/WEIRDest-People-World-Psychologically-Particularly-ebook/dp/B07RZFCPMD?ref_=ast_author_mpb), Joseph Henrich tells a story about English bricklayer and convict William Buckley, who had been sent to Australia to serve his sentence. In 1803, Buckley and a few compadres escaped from their penal colony. All of them died in the wilderness, except him. He got separated from them, and up running into an Aboriginal tribe who saved his life and adopted him.\n\nHenrich tells this story because it teaches us something about how human beings change in response to technology. All of Buckley’s friends died in the wilderness, despite being almost identical genetically to the Aboriginal tribe that adopted Buckley. Why?\n\nBuckley and his friends came from a modern culture, and he was raised with a set of norms, beliefs, and ideas that equipped him to succeed in that environment. When he was thrust into a completely different environment, he couldn’t survive. From the outside, he might’ve looked quite similar to the Aboriginals who _could_ survive but there was one distinct difference: They had cultural technology for thriving in that environment that he lacked.\n\nHenrich argues that humans have evolved “brains to allow us to most effectively learn the ideas, beliefs, values, motivations, and practices we’ll need to survive and thrive in whatever ecological or social environments we end up in.” The way this happens is through culture, which is a dramatic accelerant on our ability to solve problems and thrive.\n\nBut Henrich writes, “\\[T\\]hese genetically evolved learning abilities aren’t simply downloading a cultural software package into our innate neurological hardware. Instead, _culture rewires our brains and alters our biology_—it renovates the firmware.”\n\nIn essence, our species—our psychology, biology, brains, and bodies—is shaped by culture. And culture is, to a large extent, a function of technology. Who we are is shaped by the technology we are surrounded by.\n\nChatGPT is the latest in a long line of such cultural and technological changes that alter what it means to be human.\n\nWe don’t need to wait for [brain-computer interfaces](https://every.to/p/the-case-for-cyborgs) for AI to modify our biology. That’s happening already. The question is: Can we use it to do good instead of evil? Can we use it to create more richness and beauty, instead of scarcity and ugliness?\n\nI think we can. Let’s do it together.\n\n#### What did you think of this post?\n\n[Amazing](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/chatgpt-and-the-future-of-the-human-mind/feedback?rating=amazing) [Good](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/chatgpt-and-the-future-of-the-human-mind/feedback?rating=good) [Meh](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/chatgpt-and-the-future-of-the-human-mind/feedback?rating=meh) [Bad](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/chatgpt-and-the-future-of-the-human-mind/feedback?rating=bad)\n\n## Ideas and Apps to   Thrive in the AI Age\n\nThe essential toolkit for those shaping the future\n\n![](https://every.to/assets/icons/star-47efa897db500b001279650e47f377c4bab4028ebe52fece08879b545bcc147d.svg)![](https://every.to/assets/icons/star-47efa897db500b001279650e47f377c4bab4028ebe52fece08879b545bcc147d.svg)![](https://every.to/assets/icons/star-47efa897db500b001279650e47f377c4bab4028ebe52fece08879b545bcc147d.svg)![](https://every.to/assets/icons/star-47efa897db500b001279650e47f377c4bab4028ebe52fece08879b545bcc147d.svg)![](https://every.to/assets/icons/star-47efa897db500b001279650e47f377c4bab4028ebe52fece08879b545bcc147d.svg)\n\n\"This might be the best value you\n\ncan get from an AI subscription.\"\n\n\\- Jay S.\n\n[![Mail](https://every.to/assets/paywall/app_icons/every-7ac34d1cb7bd353d6e701bb00cfc61f798250095ebdcfd12f6d5eaf84386b096.png)](https://every.to/subscribe?source=post_paywall) Every Content\n\n[![AI&I Podcast](https://every.to/assets/app_icons/podcasts-05879434e25ad3d087a9c019d2de90fd3620fe81a3d38cc83b8ddca4ab8edb09.png)](https://every.to/podcast) AI&I Podcast\n\n[![Monologue](https://every.to/assets/paywall/app_icons/monologue-7095346b162f13e7f142fc9de290b9c7222a65019ec6aa04abdf32bbf2b11cd5.png)](https://monologue.to/?utm_source=every&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=post) Monologue\n\n[![Cora](https://every.to/assets/paywall/app_icons/cora-c72cf67256dfbe7d1805c701b3d1605954ba559a38cfb021d66c9b350de0a6d3.png)](https://cora.computer/?utm_source=every&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=post) Cora\n\n[![Sparkle](https://every.to/assets/paywall/app_icons/sparkle-b99bd07599520a38c908455679c83a9a1aa3738412b77a38e805c92d0dce5dd6.png)](https://makeitsparkle.co/every?utm_source=every&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=post) Sparkle\n\n[![Spiral](https://every.to/assets/paywall/app_icons/spiral-e9c1b877b492911c86921b7d2a9c70c5a2a4d845019b50a4e390999caf48a01d.png)](https://writewithspiral.com/?utm_source=every&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=post) Spiral\n\nJoin 100,000+ leaders, builders, and innovators\n\n![Community members](https://every.to/assets/paywall/faces-2b72f553c10b6f8c7042928513f8254f0b1056a695678d112a1159bae5c7b86a.png)\n\nEmail address\n\nAlready have an account?

My experience is that it does more than summarize. When I give it a clear direction and engage as a co-creation new things I never would have anticipated emerge. I read that the human mind is also a prediction engine. And yet we create original thought. Maybe our whole notion of intelligence needs to change, more along the lines of Bohm’s work.\n\n[♡ 0](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/chatgpt-and-the-future-of-the-human-mind#)\n\n·\n[Reply](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/chatgpt-and-the-future-of-the-human-mind#)\n\n[![](https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/user/avatar/2743/small_EVENT.to_SJH_FINALS_-15.jpg)](https://every.to/@danshipper)\n\nDan Shipper[almost 2 years ago](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/chatgpt-and-the-future-of-the-human-mind#)\n\n@Mark\\_5418 thanks Mark! yeah, i think it's \"summarize\" in the broadest sense of the word: recombining and extending existing ideas and knowledge, rather than coming up with things that are completely new. check out the Gopnik paper I linked for more on what that means\n\n[♡ 0](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/chatgpt-and-the-future-of-the-human-mind#)\n\n·\n[Reply](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/chatgpt-and-the-future-of-the-human-mind#)\n\n[![](https://every.to/assets/fallback/user-66632696250761ccb7c41f44f2881099c32d12e6d21a8ab1e489b3884988ddad.png)](https://every.to/@rahman.rizvi)\n\n@rahman.rizvi[almost 2 years ago](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/chatgpt-and-the-future-of-the-human-mind#)\n\nGreat read, thanks!

You're on fire this week, your building an app podcast was really thought provoking too.\n\nDo you have a Goodreads list or similar?

It sets out how we distribute decisions about how we organise, allowing us to reflect our values and leave behind ways of working that reproduce injustices and emotional pain in society.\n\n## Introduction to Self-Organising\n\nXR UK has developed the Self-Organising System (SOS), because it’s the best way we could find to embody the [Principles and Values](https://extinctionrebellion.uk/the-truth/about-us/#our-principles-and-values) of our movement – in particular, that we are based on autonomy and decentralisation, that we actively mitigate power, and that we value reflecting and learning.\n\nWe learn from those who have gone before us. Researchers have studied the major civil disobedience movements of the last century. One of the main indicators of successful movements is that they are highly organised and maintain organisational infrastructure under pressure.\n\nThe Importance of Structure and Mitigating Power\n\n\nA group without clear relationships and structure will simply form a hidden structure with hidden power dynamics. We avoid hierarchical power, which we are all familiar with — from school, from work and many other places — and it takes a change of mindset to work in a different way. We need a cultural shift. We can’t swap the structural power of hierarchy for a vague idea, it simply won’t work. We have to find something equally powerful to replace it with.\n\nIn the XR UK Self-Organising System, no one is in charge and authority is distributed amongst roles that are consented to by everybody in the group. It shifts power out of people and into the processes of the system, so that no single person has power over another person or the system itself.\n\nIt also includes processes that enable us to change the system itself so that XR UK can adapt and grow in the way it needs to.\n\n## Foundations of the Self-Organising System\n\nSome of the foundations of the SOS include distributing power; consent-based decision making; maintaining healthy groups; building a regenerative culture; and more. For an introduction to these topics, check out:\n\n- [SOS Introduction – Empowering the Movement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8uN7j1pjtvn9yKFiJkpJS9-2KGh9r8_s8BYTxIH94E/edit)\n\nHere are some common questions and answers that describe foundational elements of the SOS:\n\nWhy do we have a self-organising system?\n\n\nXR’s tenth principle and value is that we are based on autonomy and decentralisation. The self-organising system (SOS for short) is a set of practices that guarantees this autonomy while also enabling the different parts of the movement to work together.\n\nBut why does it have to be a system? Can’t we just trust people to organise themselves?\n\n\nFor small groups that work more or less autonomously, the full SOS may be more than you need. But when the regions and nations are interacting with the XR UK Actions, and with the Media & Messaging team, and using the technology provided by the Digital team — and so on — we need some standard ways of organising and deciding, so that we’re not having to spend time arguing from first principles all the time. These standard ways are set out in the [XR UK constitution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lsDGm3XKssPae9dlHeRy3eGZp3xkkCpn4IFeYgMbm2M/view).\n\nWho decided how we should organise ourselves?\n\n\nThis decision was made by rebels and founders early in 2019. It is rooted in an evidence-based and tested approach to self-organising called holacracy. As well as safeguarding autonomy, we believe this approach can contribute to a regenerative culture and embody other XR principles and values like mitigating the concentration of power and encouraging reflecting and learning. It aims to avoid some of the pitfalls that have undermined other progressive movements such as Occupy.\n\nOK, so what’s the gist?\n\n\nStarting from the aims of the movement as a whole, we break this down into smaller parts. To achieve our demands, what are the things — actions, communications, regen, organisational, technical etc — that we need to get done?\n\nWith each of these, we then ‘mandate’ a team to achieve them. A mandate is what the rest of the movement wants the team to do. Within this mandate the team has complete autonomy (within the Principles and Values) over how it organises itself and its work. Frequently this may involve further decentralisation, dividing the authority in its mandate into smaller mandates. These are given to sub-groups and ultimately to individual roles.\n\nDoes a mandate give you power?\n\n\nThe power to decide how you achieve a specified outcome or purpose, yes. But also some responsibilities. As well as the purpose, a mandate also comprises a set of accountabilities. These describe _how_ you will achieve the purpose, in a series of activities that others in the movement can expect you to do. The accountabilities of a group, or a role, are what they can be held accountable for.\n\nLike a job description, then?\n\n\nYes, and no. Yes, the mandate gives a general idea of _what_ a group, or role, is working towards, and _how_. But a job description sets the limits of what you’re allowed to do, and a manager can direct how you do it. A mandate flips that on its head: you can do _anything you need to do_ (that doesn’t interfere with someone else’s mandate) to achieve your purpose. You are not restricted to your accountabilities. Your accountabilities define what others can ask and expect of you. There are no managers, and no one can direct how you go about meeting your accountabilities.\n\nManaging without managers? Does that work?\n\n\nIt can if we decentralise our power through mandates, and keep evolving our organisation. We establish feedback loops within relevant groups and roles, so that each limb of the movement can renew itself. This helps embody two of our Principles and Values: mitigating power, and valuing reflecting and learning. But in turn it depends on everyone being transparent about what their mandate is, enabling others across the movement to find who is accountable for what, and to give feedback. Hence all our mandates and as many groups as possible are published on the [organism view](https://organism.extinctionrebellion.uk/) of XR UK.\n\nWhat roles does every team have?\n\n\nTo work within the [XR UK Constitution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lsDGm3XKssPae9dlHeRy3eGZp3xkkCpn4IFeYgMbm2M/view), each team needs to have three roles (the ‘core roles’):\n\n- someone to organise the work of the team and support members in their roles — the Internal Coordinator\n- someone to integrate the work of the team with the broader movement — the External Coordinator\n- someone to keep records of who’s doing what in the team, and ensure all members are on the team communication channels — the Group Admin.\n\nTogether these roles make sure that the team is as transparent and accessible as it reasonably can be to the rest of the movement — so that we can all quickly find who’s accountable for what. There are still quite a lot of meetings, but we keep them as short as possible.\n\nWhat happens when people disagree?\n\n\nIt’s inevitable we will disagree, sometimes strongly. The [XR UK constitution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lsDGm3XKssPae9dlHeRy3eGZp3xkkCpn4IFeYgMbm2M/view) outlines an ‘Integrative Decision Making’ process. If someone feels that something is not working as it should, they express this tension — ideally explaining how it impacts their mandate — and make a proposal for addressing it.\n\nAnd then you put the proposal to a vote, right?\n\n\nWe try to be less binary than Yes/No, less factional than For/Against. First, a facilitator guides the process of checking everyone understands the proposal and its implications — particularly for them and their mandates. Then the facilitator invites reactions to the proposal. Finally they ask for any objections. We avoid majority rule — voting — or minority rule — veto. Objections are only valid if they convincingly show that harm would arise from the proposal (for example: if a group would no longer be able to exercise its mandate, that would be harm). “I don’t think that’s going to work” is a _reaction_ that the proposer may or may not take on when implementing the proposal, but it is _not_ a valid _objection_.\n\nDoes a valid objection mean you need to start from scratch with a new proposal?\n\n\nMaybe, but hopefully not. A proposal can’t go forward if there’s a valid objection, but the group is invited to think creatively to suggest changes to the proposal. These changes should retain the desired impact of the original proposal while also avoiding the harm identified in the objection.\n\n### Rebellion Academy Courses\n\nUK Rebellion Academy is an online learning platform where you can work through online trainings in your own time to learn more about Extinction Rebellion\n\n- [Intro to XR Group Structures](https://uk.rebellion.academy/enrol/index.php?id=33)\n\nThis training is about how XR organises, communicates and makes decisions. It covers the purpose of the SOS and the six underlying principles of Self-Organising Systems.\n\n- SOS — A Change in Culture (link coming soon)\n\nThis SOS course follows on from the Intro to XR Group Structures training above. It covers how XR UK’s Self-Organising System aligns us with XR’s Principles and Values, and how we approach meetings and decision-making.\n\n## How SOS Works\n\nThe Constitution sets out our agreed processes for distributing and making decisions, and for organising within and between teams. Whilst XR UK teams are bound by the Constitution, the Nations and Regions of the UK, as well as Local Groups, are not – although they may choose to adopt it, or parts of it, if they wish to (and many have). These smaller, autonomous groups can act under XR’s names as long as they are in alignment with XR [Principles and Values](https://extinctionrebellion.uk/the-truth/about-us/#our-principles-and-values).\n\n- [The XR UK Constitution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lsDGm3XKssPae9dlHeRy3eGZp3xkkCpn4IFeYgMbm2M/view)\n- More links coming soon\n\n## How To Guides\n\nThe Rebel Toolkit, XR UK’s library of resources and creative work, gives more in-depth guides on how to use our Self-Organising System in practice to build healthy teams, co-evolve the movement and meet our demands.\n\nYou can find information on [how SOS works in terms of the Constitution, Roles, Processes & Policies](https://rebeltoolkit.extinctionrebellion.uk/books/xr-uk-constitution-guides-and-resources/page/xr-uk-sos-%E2%80%94-constitution-roles-processes-policies)\n\nGuidance on how to put these into practice (e.g. decision-making, coordination, working with other teams) can be found as part of a larger cross-movement guide on Building Healthy Teams (link coming soon).\n\n## Contact us\n\nTo ask any questions, request support and facilitation, or join the team and deepen your knowledge of self-organising, please email [xr.mandates@gmail.com](mailto:xr.mandates@gmail.com) or speak to us on our [XRUK SOS Mattermost channel](https://organise.earth/uk/channels/self-organising-system).\n\n## Sign up for news\n\nFirst name\n\nLast name\n\nEmail\n\nPhone\n\nPostcode\n\nCountrySelect countryAfghanistanAland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBolivia, Plurinational State ofBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCabo VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos (Keeling) IslandsColombiaComorosCongoCongo, the Democratic Republic of theCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d'IvoireCroatiaCubaCuraçaoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland Islands (Malvinas)Faroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHoly See (Vatican City State)HondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIran, Islamic Republic ofIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKorea, Democratic People's Republic ofKorea, Republic ofKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People's Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacaoMacedonia, the former Yugoslav Republic ofMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesia, Federated States ofMoldova, Republic ofMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestine, State ofPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarRéunionRomaniaRussian FederationRwandaSaint BarthélemySaint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da CunhaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Martin (French part)Saint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint Maarten (Dutch part)SlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyrian Arab RepublicTaiwanTajikistanTanzania, United Republic ofThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited StatesUnited States Minor Outlying IslandsUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuela, Bolivarian Republic ofViet NamVirgin Islands, BritishVirgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe\n\nI give my consent to Extinction Rebellion to get in touch with me using the information I provide, for the purpose of news, actions and requests for volunteers and donations.

Regenerative Culture is the radical process within Extinction Rebellion which affirms our connected roots to deep and abiding nourishment.\n\nYou can contact us at [xr.regenerativeculture@gmail.com](mailto:xr.regenerativeculture@gmail.com)\n\n## A Regenerative Rebellion\n\nRegenerative Cultures seek to bring a different approach to climate and other activist movements. They are how we move towards a practice and demonstration of the change we want to deeply experience in this and all society. We aim to nurture new cultures that are resilient and robust and which can support us all through the changes we must inevitably face together. Regenerative Cultures precede, hold us through and last beyond the actions that we take as part of our rebellion.\n\nIn XR we recognise that we have much work to do so that we can truly embody Regenerative Cultures within our movement. It is a necessary way to generate meaningful and lasting change in our shared world. There is no singular definition of regenerative cultures, but a framework based on natural principles allows each of us to develop our own approach to practicing a regenerative way of being. At its simplest this means putting a little bit more in than we take out.\n\nWe are experimenting with new ways we can come together to nurture the kind of deep care that will be needed to sustain ourselves and our communities, and we invite you to participate by considering what Regenerative Cultures mean to you. Here you will find some of the tools to support you through Rebellion and beyond.\n\n## XR Don’t Panic: What to do in an emergency when you don’t know what to do!\n\nEveryone can feel vulnerable or become vulnerable depending on our personal experiences and the situation in which we find ourselves at any one time.\n\nWe are all crew. Always approach problems with others and use the knowledge and skills each person brings. The Don’t Panic team advise you to avoid working alone.\n\nFor more information or advice please email the team on [xr.dontpanic@protonmail.com](mailto:xr.dontpanic@protonmail.com) or click on the dropdown below:\n\nMore information and contacts\n\n\nWe are responsible for ourselves and hope to support others.\n\nPlease do not try to deal with a situation alone when you have gone beyond your skills and training or when you feel you are out of your comfort zone!  Involve others around you and try to make contact with the vulnerable person’s friends, parents, guardians, carers or family. Having people around that the vulnerable person knows and trusts can be massively helpful.\n\nThere are also less urgent, or less clear situations which are on-going which you feel uncomfortable about but aren’t quite sure how to resolve or help with.  Alternatively, you may be planning an event and may want advice ahead of time.  Again please email us for advice on [xr.dontpanic@protonmail.com](mailto:xr.dontpanic@protonmail.com).\n\nOther useful numbers:\n\n- Emergency services: 999\n- Health advice line: 111\n- NSPCC Helpline: 0808 800 5000\n- Childline: 0800 1111\n- Samaritans: 116 123\n- Mind helpline: 0300 123 3393\n- Frank drugs helpline: 0300 123 6600\n\n## Don’t Panic Booklet\n\nThis book aims to provide guidance to help you start thinking about dealing with challenging situations. It is packed full of scenarios for when you are feeling panicked and not sure what to do.\n\n[Read the Don’t Panic Booklet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10UbkxVAUVBJt0xtS_uE78LXCV8QeFwvW76BB6T_ZSok/edit)\n\n## Action Wellbeing\n\nCivil disobedience can be exciting, exhilarating even, and sometimes also exhausting and stressful. We want to build a regenerative culture where we take care of ourselves and others before, during and beyond actions. Action Wellbeing is one of the Action Support roles which helps activists feel safe and supported. Action Wellbeing is the responsibility of everyone – we are all crew!\n\nYou can explore more of our resources which may support you in creating or being part of an Action Wellbeing Team\n\n## Post-Action Wellbeing\n\nGetting ‘back to normal’ after an action isn’t always easy. We’ve got you covered – read on for our best advice on looking after yourself and others as we come back down to earth; complete with bundles of free resources!\n\n[Read more about Post-Action Wellbeing](https://rebellion.earth/2019/10/20/post-rebellion-blues/)\n\n## Other Resources\n\nRegenerative Action Cycle\n\n\nThis model is based on the observation of natural cycles as well as teachings from many regenerative cultures and indigenous cultures around the world. It draws out ways we can follow these cycles in our human activities to foster connection and regeneration within ourselves, within our communities and in our relationship with the other-than-human communities we are part of.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/extinctionrebellion.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Regenerative-Action-Cycle_1.1.jpg?w=3000&ssl=1)\nArrestee Welfare\n\n\nOur aim is to support rebels to make informed choices about arrest, reducing the impact of challenging experiences through the arrest process and criminal justice system and support their wellbeing throughout.\n\nCreating a framework within the XR network which ensures adequate pre-arrest preparation, during-action support and post-arrest care enables supporters and arrestees to work together.\n\n[Explore more resources on our Arrestee Welfare page](https://rebellion.earth/act-now/resources/arrestee-welfare/)\n\nDebrief\n\n\n### Why Debrief?\n\nThrough our meetings, actions and rebellions we are filled with thoughts, emotions and hormones, things are messy and beautiful and stressful and passionate and traumatic all at the same time. Burn-out can occur for people who take on or support direct action, because we often take on a lot or find ourselves in high energy or anxiety situations, and of course we take this stuff on because we really care.\n\nIt is important to have time to process events in a constructive way.\n\n### Aims of debrief\n\n- Process challenging experiences\n- Grow as a movement by learning from what went well and what didn’t go so well\n- Explore tensions and develop conflict resilience\n\nEach affinity group self facilitates a check-in as soon as possible post action, or at least daily for sustained actions, in order that each member can have some time to process: What actually happened? How am I right now? What do I need? How are we as a group? How can I support the health of this group?\n\nIn the days following an action a full debrief should be carried out with all involved.\n\nRemember it’s important to physically nourish ourselves, share our stories and let off some steam before jumping straight in to debrief.\n\n[Download the On-site debrief flyer](https://rebellion.earth/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/On-site-debrief-flyer.pdf) [Download The Off-site full debrief Document](https://rebellion.earth/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Off-Site-Debrief-Template-for-a-thorough-post-action-debrief.pdf) [See more debrief resources](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D10zWeKYO-Bhg1MGs17nWq4uVfJcnjXX)\nTransformative Conflict\n\n\nConflict is inevitable. We are in conflict with the degenerative culture that depletes us humans, the Earth and all living beings. We choose to see conflict as an opportunity for learning, and processing conflict is welcomed and encouraged. We also recognise that a relational, transformative, connected approach to conflict asks more of us all than enforcing change in a punitive way. The process of a transformative system engages us in dialogue and connection that allows us to hear other perspectives, repair broken channels of communication and integrate our learnings from this experience.\n\n### **How do I get support?**\n\nOur Transformative Conflict website tells you more about dealing with conflict within your group, initiating a conflict process and how the Transformative Conflict team can support you with guidance or facilitation.\n\n[Find out more on our Transformative Conflict website](https://sites.google.com/view/xruk-transformativeconflict/home)\nConsent Advocacy\n\n\nBy rebelling we are withdrawing our consent from the governments and systems that are failing us. Spreading a healthy consent culture is vital for our regenerative culture and community safety, as it aligns us with our desires so we can unleash our creativity in respectful and beautiful ways.\n\n[Read more about XR’s consent culture, find support and get involved](https://rebellion.earth/act-now/resources/wellbeing/consent-advocacy/)\nGrief Tending\n\n\nGrief is the price we pay for our love. Anyone who loves this Earth and this life is experiencing grief in some form now, coming together to give it space can help both our wellbeing and our capacity to act to avoid climate breakdown. We provide a space in which we can develop an XR culture of grief tending work that draws upon an unbroken ancestry and offers guidance and support to those drawn to the work.\n\nChildren and Young People\n\n\nIf you are interested in promoting regenerative culture amongst children and young people we will be putting some resources in this space in the next few weeks.\n\nXR Youth have a regenerative culture team who you can contact for more support and ideas. Email address: [XRYouth.Regen@gmail.com](mailto:XRYouth.Regen@gmail.com)\n\nXR Open Homes\n\n\nWe are over the moon to re-launch the XR open homes program, providing rebels with homes all over the country for rest and reconnection. We have log cabins, remote cottages, rooms in stays – all for free for hard working rebels needing some respite and nature connection. We like to think of it as the XR free airbnb!\n\n[See the interactive map of all the homes offered to us](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1N7DBMTGkCJur_jGechGeurcFSa9y1kyE&ll=54.19347349568635%2C-2.1589738000000125&z=6)\n\nPlease contact us at [xr-openhomes@protonmail.com](mailto:xr-openhomes@protonmail.com) to request a stay, providing the following infos: where you’d like to stay, an idea of when and how long you are looking to stay (NB as this is a volunteer service we cannot guarantee a date or location); and finally some idea of your links and involvement in XR.\n\n## Sign up for news\n\nFirst name\n\nLast name\n\nEmail\n\nPhone\n\nPostcode\n\nCountrySelect countryAfghanistanAland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBolivia, Plurinational State ofBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCabo VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos (Keeling) IslandsColombiaComorosCongoCongo, the Democratic Republic of theCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d'IvoireCroatiaCubaCuraçaoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland Islands (Malvinas)Faroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHoly See (Vatican City State)HondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIran, Islamic Republic ofIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKorea, Democratic People's Republic ofKorea, Republic ofKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People's Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacaoMacedonia, the former Yugoslav Republic ofMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesia, Federated States ofMoldova, Republic ofMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestine, State ofPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarRéunionRomaniaRussian FederationRwandaSaint BarthélemySaint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da CunhaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Martin (French part)Saint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint Maarten (Dutch part)SlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyrian Arab RepublicTaiwanTajikistanTanzania, United Republic ofThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited StatesUnited States Minor Outlying IslandsUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuela, Bolivarian Republic ofViet NamVirgin Islands, BritishVirgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe\n\nI give my consent to Extinction Rebellion to get in touch with me using the information I provide, for the purpose of news, actions and requests for volunteers and donations.

[Apply](https://79izjwoju7n.typeform.com/FFSeason2)\n\n![💡 Callout icon](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nWe’ve launched our governance process for funding Community-Initiated Projects! Learn what’s involved and how to pitch us [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IIovfed4Uj7Kg4OGoMCpscB1syc4cmXZOvAIqK7kTJc/edit#heading=h.p6l2a285wi29).\n\n## I. Our approach: Vibez Infinity Flow\n\n> Governance (noun): the act or process of governing or overseeing the control and direction of something (such as a country or an organization)\n\nGovernance, or DAO Design generally, is understood and realized in many different ways throughout the DAO space. There has been a recent shift, with many DAO operators and contributors realizing the need for more nuance in current conceptions of decentralization, autonomy and hierarchy.\n\nCommunity is at the center of all that we do at Forefront. This means that our overarching aim is to nurture and enhance human flourishing and human well-being.\n\nTo this end, we have crafted an approach to DAO Design & Governance that we call “The Vibez Infinity Flow.” DAO Design & Governance that is optimized for vibez, or human flourishing, must be rooted in the reality of human being, human needs and human aspirations.\n\nIn the Vibez Infinity Flow model, we have to contend with a Polarity, or a rhythmic movement or dance between two complementary opposites, that, when harmonized, become generative. At the heart of our DAO Design/Governance is the intentional creation of avenues by which these complementary opposites are brought into relationship - so that they may be reconciled and harmonized, again and again, by the human being.\n\n### Org-Level Polarity\n\nAt the org-level, the Polarity is between:\n\nDecentralized aspect of the org (that which is emergent, fluid and adaptable)\n\nCentralized aspect of the org or the Long-Term Vision, or North Star (that which is deliberately designed, stable and held steady)\n\n### Individual-Level Polarity\n\nAt the individual-level, the Polarity is between:\n\nAutonomy \\- the striving of the human being to create and move toward freedom and self-expression, and\n\nCooperation or Contextual Awareness \\- the striving of the human being to belong, to understand and participate in the Whole of which they are a part\n\nFundamentally, the org-level and individual-level Polarity are the same.\n\nThe Vibez Infinity Flow describes the greater vocation or calling of every human being and community.\n\nAs individuals \\- We are each called to step out, time and again, from the communal matrix and differentiate through autonomous self-expression. So too, time and again, we are called to fall back into the communal matrix to re-integrate with it and feel at home with our fellow human beings.\n\nAs a DAO community - The community is composed of numerous sovereign individuals who, time and again, step out and differentiate from the communal matrix through various contributions formed out of their unique insights (“I Consciousness”). To ensure coherence with the Whole, however, this constant movement toward Differentiation must be continually harmonized via a counter-balancing movement toward Integration, ie, Contributors continually re-integrating into community or “We-Consciousness.”\n\n![](https://ffdao.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F88e284cf-aa4d-4292-bc13-7e1f7af06c8a%2FFF01__.jpg?table=block&id=452a550c-adaf-43d3-a350-3019a5b4e045&spaceId=8bdbe86a-1b2f-43a4-b0bb-70695244bbda&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\nS2 — Vibez Infinity Flow\n\nALT\n\n### Vibez Infinity Flow In Action\n\nThe Forefront DAO realizes the Vibez Infinity Flow using three principal means of Governance:\n\nForefront Forum (F3);\n\nDecision-Space Mapping; and\n\nOKRs & Reflection Epochs.\n\n#### Forefront Forum (F3)\n\nA bi-weekly live discussion forum convening Core Staff, team Stewards, and all active Contributors. This continually refreshed contextualization ensures that the actions of sovereign individuals and groups cohere with the mission and priorities of the DAO community as a whole.\n\nThe overarching objective is three-fold:\n\nProvide opportunity for teams to update the entire DAO on the most significant developments, opportunities and needs in their respective operating environments (contextualized at the “forest level”, vs the trees);\n\nCultivate culture of open, P2P sharing of info and resources to empower collective learning and context-enriched autonomous action\n\nCore Staff re-syncs the entire DAO, contextualizing the current state of the org against longer-term North Star, near-term priorities and the culture/values that will get us there.\n\nF3 thus facilitates the Vibez Infinity Flow, harmonizing the movements toward Differentiation and Integration. It empowers individual Contributors and small teams with the context they need for impactful autonomous action. At the same time, this continually refreshed contextualization ensures that the actions of sovereign individuals cohere with the mission and priorities of the DAO community as a whole. F3’s focus on continuous socialized learning and collective sense-making means that we are empowered, as a whole, to experiment, receive vital feedback from each other and our environment and continuously adjust and iterate.\n\n#### Decision-Space Mapping\n\nDecision-Space Mapping explicitly grants specific decision-making authorities and constraints for all core roles (Staff, Leads, Coordinators and team Stewards) and working groups. Just as F3 facilitates the Vibez Infinity Flow, so too, the clarity provided by specifically articulated (yet adaptable) Decision Spaces empower autonomous action and harmonizes it with the DAO’s North Star.\n\n#### OKRs & Reflection Epochs.\n\nOKRs (aka Objectives & Key Results) & Reflection Epochs are the means by which individual Contributors and discrete working groups achieve coherence with the aims of the DAO as a whole.\n\nThe Core Staff sets strategic, DAO-wide annual and Season OKRs.\n\nWorking Groups set tactical monthly OKRs that support and roll up into topline OKRs.\n\nContributors set individual monthly OKRs that support and roll up into their Working Group OKRs.\n\nThe Forefront DAO integrates into our production cadence rhythmic periods of rest & reflection. During these Reflection Epochs, the entire DAO is engaged in reflection, evaluating the impact of our activities against our shared commitments and OKRs.\n\n## II. Season 2 Governance Objectives\n\n![](https://ffdao.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fef50ecb9-067b-46da-a993-90c879df4de7%2FFF_03.jpg?table=block&id=66ac98fb-b366-469f-ba3f-2032cc06ed20&spaceId=8bdbe86a-1b2f-43a4-b0bb-70695244bbda&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\nS2 — DAO Design & Governance\n\nALT\n\nIn our approach to DAO Design & Governance, we strive to optimize for the Vibez Infinity Flow, or this harmonizing of complementary opposites.\n\nGuiding principles include:\n\n“Maximal trust and delegation”\n\nThis describes the intentional design of space within which individual autonomy can best unfold in service to the Whole, or Community.\n\n“Maximal trust and delegation” points to our conviction that the well-being of the Whole, or the communal interest, can be faithfully served by an individual or any particular locus of activity (a Team). This assumes the all-important presence of coherence with the culture and overarching purpose or guiding intuition of the Whole.\n\n> Trustlessness may be suited to describe blockchain architecture, but trust is the basis of authentic, restorative community. We trust one another. We trust that we each have unique capabilities, and that this is our collective super power.\n\nThus, we freely distribute/decentralize governance authority and influence to individuals/Teams who are on the “frontline” and capable of concretely grasping the situation-specific optimum.\n\nWe empower Contributors and Teams with as wide a Decision Space as possible, so that they can freely maneuver and innovate. But the necessary corollary of this freedom of movement is an awareness of, and commitment to, the needs of the Whole.\n\nDecision-making agencies with regard to the day-to-day operational & tactical execution of work should always be pushed to the level of the DAO where the information is richest - where perception of the relevant issue is first-hand - direct and immediate.\n\nIn other words, contributors \"on the frontline\" of any given matter know best how to carry out their work. They should be free from unnecessary “decision-making by committee”.\n\nWorking Group Consensus: working groups are empowered to set internal governance processes (as long as they are consistent with our Community Keystone and DAO-wide protocols) and decide and act on matters within their Decision Space, including setting OKRs, with synch’ing from Core Team.\n\n2\\. All decisions that relate generally to equity, justice and rights within the DAO community  will be stewarded, initially, by the Core Staff and then progressively decentralized to a dedicated, representative governance body akin to a DAO Legislature.\n\nIn Season 2, we are exploring the following questions:\n\nHow to create a framework that enables progressive decentralization and sustainable growth.\n\nHow to foster a fluid and contextualized engagement from all DAO members.\n\nHow to encourage an active culture of participation and value creation while incentivizing and retaining high-value DAO members.\n\nHow to create a scalable and progressive decentralized governance mechanism to allow the DAO to expand into new exploration territories.\n\nHow to craft an evolving process that both 1) integrates space for experimentation and quick action, as well as intentional design and reflection, and 2) creates continual opportunities for learning, feedback and iterative evolution.\n\n## III. DAO Structure\n\n![](https://ffdao.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fc26edb26-5759-472c-a51b-6f823de3ce89%2Fllja______(1).jpeg?table=block&id=750b3a15-baf5-4dd1-8f99-7b52b34186fb&spaceId=8bdbe86a-1b2f-43a4-b0bb-70695244bbda&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\nS2 — DAO Design & Governance\n\nALT\n\n### A. Core Staff\n\nCore Staff set policies and frameworks on general decisions on DAO roadmap, tokenomics, mission and vision.\n\n#### Membership\n\nThe Core team is currently appointed as Core Staff. The core staff sets policies for membership and removal.\n\n#### Process\n\nCore Staff’s mission is to steward the high-level strategic vision of the DAO. Core Staff also stewards core team projects. Members regularly meet to coordinate the DAO’s North Star vision, roadmap, near-term and longer-term priorities (OKRs), questions of resource allocations and possible community projects and proposals.\n\nAll core decisions will be clearly communicated to the wider community. The core team will be accountable and transparent with all core decisions. This process requires an ongoing process of feedback, learning and improvement in all directions. All feedback is used to improve the governance process, which then is communicated to the wider community.\n\n#### Examples\n\n### B. Working Groups\n\nWorking groups (teams) are the basic “unit” of the DAO. They have the ability to decide and act on matters in their domains, which their members agree on via an internal voting process.\n\n#### Membership\n\nTo join, members have to be onboarded via an onboarding process. Members of the working group receive a monthly base allocation, with bonus potential, discussed in further detail in the Compensation section.\n\n#### Offboarding\n\nOffboarding of Members may occur through violation of our Community Keystone and/or issues related to work-evaluation. The offboarding may be temporary or permanent.\n\nIn the event of violations of our Community Keystone, any community member or Contributor may initiate the process of offboarding by submitting a formal write-up. At present, Core Team will steward the evaluation and resolution of all write-ups. In the future, this will be progressively decentralized to a dedicated working group under Community Ops, or a representative governance body akin to a DAO Judiciary. In the future, we are committed to developing a pathway for “restorative reconciliation” and integrating it into our general offboarding framework.\n\nBy officially onboarding as a Contributor to the Forefront DAO, you agree to honor commitments such as team and DAO-wide meetings; using Basecamp, our project management and team communication forum; and regular peer-to-peer and self assessments of work. Continuing membership in the Contributor community is contingent upon honoring these commitments.\n\n#### Structure\n\nIn Season 2, Contributors will be onboarded to specific Working Groups with specific needs/roles. Once Contributors are onboarded, the Working Group Steward will synch with Contributors to create roles with specific responsibilities pertaining to Working Group activities.\n\nWith synching from Core Staff and stewards, working groups shall set monthly Objectives and Key Results (“OKRs”) specific to their teams to drive progress toward DAO-level Season OKRs. Members meet on a weekly cadence to coordinate workstreams, track progress against OKRs, and determine upcoming week’s focus.\n\n#### Process\n\nTo optimize for Vibez Infinity Flow, working group membership shall generally be capped at 10 members. Any increase above that number usually indicates that the existing group should get more focused and spin out a new working group. Members may make a proposal for a new project/working group.\n\nGenerally speaking, all proposals require a minimum of three (3) active contributors as sponsors before the proposal is eligible for governance; this ensures that the new initiative has a sufficient level of existing community support behind it.\n\nWorking group Stewards will coordinate workstream delegation and team activities at a high level. Where needed, working groups use consensus governance to make other supporting decisions. In this framework, consent is reached when no members within the working group present a serious objection to a proposal. The consensus should promote mutual trust and respect, constructive feedback, and relationship building.\n\n#### Example\n\n### C. Funding for Working Groups\n\nForefront Season 2 operations are funded throughout the season by the DAO via a combination of FF and USDC tokens held in the DAO treasury. Season 2 FF allocation is capped at 300,000 $FF for contributors compensation & rewards, and seasonal projects under FF Labs Program.\n\nAn additional $70,000 USDC will be be reserved for contributors stables compensation and $50,000 USDC for ecosystem development (whitelisted funding initiatives includes: FF Residency program, FF grants, and public goods)\n\nAt the launch of Season 2, Contributors will be onboarded to a select number of highly prioritized working groups. Under our approach for intentional scaling, we will expand and seed additional working groups when existing teams are strongly rooted via culturally and strategically aligned Contributors.\n\nWithin the constraints of this intentional, emergent approach to scaling, it may be possible for Contributors to propose new working groups in Season 2. In order to be considered for funding, all proposed projects/working groups should:\n\nBe strongly linked to the mission and OKRs of an existing working group\n\nHave well defined OKRs and budget\n\nHave a minimum of three (3) active Contributors sponsoring the proposal\n\nProjects that do not meet these criteria are considered in the “ideation” phase and therefore won’t qualify for any funding from the DAO. Highly experimental projects can seek funding from other DAO initiatives, such as Community mini-Seed grants, FF Labs’ Open Call, etc.\n\nThe core staff and tokenomics group will be responsible to distribute funding to projects and working groups, as well as monitor and provide suggestions to improve the runway and accounting system.\n\nLast updated Feb 25, 2022",

Companies with more capital – or expected ability to absorb more capital in the future – are ideally valued more highly than others.\n\nThat isn’t the case for every organization. Jacob Horne argues in his essay on [“Hyperstructures”](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html) that crypto protocols built with certain traits are valuable not because of cash flows (e.g. through extractive fees) or asset valuation. Instead, they are valuable due to the shared ownership of the protocol by those building on and using it.\n\nJacob highlights the \"threat of the fee\" – the ability for token-holders to turn on fees at the protocol level – as the valuable component of ownership, since rational owners won’t want to devalue the protocol by enacting an extractive fee.\n\nIn other words, companies are valuable when they continuously extract value for shareholders. Protocols are valuable when they continuously create value for the public.\n\nHowever, not much has been written on the economic model for tokenized communities more broadly. This essay will explore what tokenized communities are, why they are valuable, and why they will create fundamentally new means of value-generation and distribution.\n\n## What is a tokenized community?\n\nTokenized communities can take many forms, but they can be defined by the following:\n\n1. **Tokenized:** coordinates around a commonly held token on a blockchain.\n2. **Platformless:** not inherently tied to any centralized platform or tool.\n3. **Self-managing:** leadership is distributed amongst roles, not individuals.\n4. **Collectively governed:** governed by all token-holders.\n5. **Meme-driven:** working toward the proliferation of a common meme.\n6. **Positive-sum:** economic model is expansive, not extractive.\n7. **Aspirational:** actively working to progressively fulfill the first 6 criteria.\n\n_**Tokenized community:**_ _a progressively self-managing and collectively-governed community that works toward the proliferation and development of a common meme using a token as its primary means of coordination._\n\nA tokenized community doesn’t need to be centrally planned or mission-driven from day one. Tokenized communities are often [“headless brands,”](https://otherinter.net/research/headless-brands/) developing emergent narratives through decentralized means. However, while the mission of a tokenized community may be emergent, the consensus must be clear to and embraced by stakeholders.\n\nLet’s dig into each of the characteristics in detail:\n\n### Tokenized\n\nA tokenized community must be tokenized… shocker!\n\nWhat does it mean for a community to be tokenized? Simply put, tokenization implies that a community is using a token as its primary means of coordination. The token is a proxy for some larger meme or set of values.\n\nFor example, FWB is tokenized. Membership is limited to tokenholders above a certain threshold. Events are token-gated. Content is token-gated. Life in FWB revolves around the token.\n\nOn the other hand, Time Magazine minted an NFT collection. Time is not a tokenized community. The community at-large has not adopted the token as a means of organizing around the brand in any meaningful way.\n\n### Platformless\n\nTokenized communities are platformless social networks.\n\nGiven their use of a token as the primary means of coordination, they are not tied to any communications tool or social media platform. They are independent of centralized infrastructure.\n\nA good way to test this for most tokenized communities today is to ask: if their primary communications tool (e.g. Discord) disappeared, would this community still exist?\n\nBeing platformless means that tokenized communities can be truly global and open.\n\n### Self-Managing\n\nIn self-managing organizations, leadership is distributed across roles, not individuals.\n\nRather than there being one leader in a community, there are many. Hierarchy is dynamic based on the specific function being carried out, the scope of the decision, or the context of the work.\n\nTokenized communities enable us to unlock new forms of work and coordination across previously unrelated groups of people.\n\n### Collectively governed\n\nTokenized communities are collectively governed.\n\nThis does not mean that token-holders vote on every decision in the community. Rather, it means that power in the DAO ultimately lies in the hands of token-holders.\n\nTokenized communities ensure some means of voting out core contributors and creating, editing, and ratifying community-wide proposals. This is most commonly manifested in treasury governance – members of tokenized communities have a say in how the group’s treasury is allocated.\n\nWhile leaders might be pushing the community forward, tokenized communities make sure that the puck stops with the collective.\n\n### Meme-driven\n\nCollective governance is pointless without a common meme driving the community forward.\n\nTokenized communities are working toward a collective goal or upholding a shared set of values. In other words, tokenized communities use tokens to coordinate around the proliferation of a shared meme.\n\nBy meme, I mean an idea or element of culture that evolves as it spreads throughout a network.\n\nLet’s take some examples:\n\n- Krause House: own and operate an **NBA team**.\n- Gitcoin: support and fund **public goods**.\n- Forefront: support and build **tokenized communities**.\n\nBeing meme-driven is a necessary component of tokenized communities – it makes “sharing in common” valuable.\n\n### Positive-sum\n\nTokenized communities are positive-sum.\n\nTokenized communities create value by building expansive value on top of existing protocols and information _in line with the shared meme of the community_. Despite being open source, with little to no “proprietary” resources, tokenized communities create value for the entire network by giving supply and demand side access to tokenholders.\n\n### Aspirational\n\nFinally, tokenized communities are aspirational.\n\nWhile using a token doesn’t _inherently_ make a community self-managing or decentralized, the benefits of (and value accrual to) the token aren’t maximized unless those criteria are upheld.\n\nHowever, no organization will fulfill the first 6 criteria purely on day one. Tokenized communities are progressively working to fulfill the above criteria, making an underlying and defining north star of every tokenized community [to build a better tokenized community.](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1504756136305741852) This is best articulated in the thesis around “progressive decentralization.”\n\n## The Economics of Community Tokens\n\nTokens are investments in memes. Tokenized communities use tokens to coordinate around the proliferation of a meme.\n\nThis simple idea has deep implications for token economics.\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning of the essay, protocol tokens are financially valuable in large part because of the \"threat of the fee.\" Taking this idea to its extreme, a token’s governance power is powerful because it gives you the ability to _conserve the vibes_. As a builder on the protocol, you hold to help ensure that you can’t get deplatformed. As a user, you hold to help ensure fees don’t increase. As a passive investor, you hold to help ensure that the protocol continues to grow.\n\nAll of these goals are served by playing positive-sum games, ensuring that the protocol stays open and as valuable as possible for everyone.\n\nCommunity tokens follow a similar path to value accrual. While short-term value may accrue to the token through gating access (e.g. to Discord, content, product, events, etc.), long-term value accrues when community members are holding to:\n\n1. _Influence the meme._ As a holder, I want to have a say in how the meme is manifested. In other words, token governance is a means of contributing to a headless brand. The balance between meme conservation (group) and evolution (individual) is manifested in the [Vibes Infinity Flow](https://forefront.mirror.xyz/1NBjW3ubczb8IKKtGPKwA2hZEwhUDODuH9UIZfNaJ3A).\n2. _Spread the meme._ As a holder, I also want to ensure that more value is continuing to be created for as many new community members as possible. This increases the value of the meme, a net-positive for everyone involved.\n\nIn some ways, this is no different than other financial assets in communities we’re a part of today: I want to make my neighborhood as nice as possible so that my home value increases. I want to give back to my university so that the value of my degree increases. I want to be a productive citizen so that the national economy grows.\n\nCommunity tokens serve as financialized coordination tools in previously unfinancialized communities.\n\nSo how _do_ tokenized communities economically sustain themselves? This is primarily a question of how individual members and contributors get paid, so that they aren’t forced to allocate time elsewhere. Unlike protocols, people need to be paid.\n\nI don’t think this question has a concrete answer yet, but there are many promising experiments. Paying contributors with the native token is one way, and I believe long-term there will be more creative ways to use community tokens across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nHowever, a key point to make is that fees/traditional pricing models aren’t inherently bad, but they should be expansive: the value captured should be directly aligned with the value created. Economic models for tokenized communities should be viewed through the lens creating value for the community rather than capturing value from the customer.\n\n## One Token, Many Communities\n\nIf tokens are investments in memes, every community doesn’t need a unique token. Protocols already have this figured out.\n\nThe most successful protocols are built to be the foundations of countless platforms. [Zora](https://zora.co/) is built to be the infrastructure powering millions of NFT marketplaces. [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is built to power exchanges across a variety of apps and wallets that integrate it.\n\nThe most valuable community tokens will be widely used across organizations as a means of coordinating the development of a common meme.\n\nYou could imagine thousands of communities with unique membership NFT collections, each with their own perspective on how public goods should be funded. Each of them could use the same ERC-20 ($GTC) as a coordination tool.\n\nThis isn’t the only way forward. Very opinionated tokenomics might not be possible without each tokenized community having some sort of unique coordination token. The point is that if club tokens are representative of the memes, then “community M&A” might actually take the form of just… using the same token.\n\nRafathebuilder touches on this idea in his [post](https://creators.mirror.xyz/BIKmTKdNiMkK1dbtUInS0zoZgVdo18i55Vh3iMU9g_I) on DAO leadership:\n\n> The last piece is crucial. The benefit of developing others compounds over time and outweighs the initial investment required. _**As a result, those with most influence in web3 are often those that have helped others become leaders.**_\n>\n> This might be the killer feature of DAO leadership: there’s an incentive for mutual growth. This self-reinforcing loop becomes a recursive process.\\*\\*\n>\n> \\*\\*\n\nThe same is true at the organizational level. Tokenized communities become more valuable as they empower other communities to form and grow around a shared meme.\n\nJust as the biggest protocols will have millions of platforms building on top of them to serve specific users, the most successful community tokens will have millions of communities building on top of them to serve specific sub-groups and expand access to new sets of people.\n\nThus, community tokens can be broken into two categories:\n\n1. _Network Tokens_: tokens that represent a shared meme that act as a “schelling point” to connect other communities that aim to proliferate that meme in a specific way or for a specific audience.\n2. _Membership Tokens_: tokens that represent membership in an individual community that falls under a “network’s” umbrella.\n\nThis is why both NFTs and ERC-20s will continue to be important tools in the community token toolbox. Much more on this in another essay to come.\n\n## The Future is Tokenized Communities\n\nThis essay takes heavy inspiration, in format and in content, from [Other Internet](https://otherinter.net/research/market-protocol-fit/#conclusion-headless-strategy) and [Jacob Horne](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html), who have written extensively about protocols, tokens, and “market-protocol fit.”\n\nLike protocols, there will always be _some_ incentive to fork community tokens. Today, launching your own token is basically free money. Speculation is a powerful force which is why we see so many tokens (and rugs) launched every day.\n\nHowever, tokenized communities are not protocols. At birth, tokenized communities are “a token and a dream.” They are an opportunity for and a mechanism by which people can coordinate around a shared meme. They are meme first, protocol/product second.\n\nAs the ecosystem matures, communities will realize that it is mutually beneficial for participating groups to lean into a shared network token rather than minting their own from scratch. Community tokens will act as a “schelling point” for groups embracing a common meme, who will be able build on top of existing economies rather than recreating their own.\n\nTokenized communities are the future of organizing. Let’s keep building that future.\n\n* * *\n\n_Thank you to Scott, Katie, Chase, Krish, Ed, Joey, Julia, Flex, and Reka for edits, comments, and jam sessions for this piece._\n\n_Also, a huge shout out to Other Internet, Jacob Horne, and Rafa for the incredible insights that brought this essay to life._\n\nSubscribe to Forefront\n\nReceive the latest updates directly to your inbox.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe\n\n![Nft graphic](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xok46Vv79klq9GCKxKSPp?height=2048&width=2048)\n\nMint this entry as an NFT to add it to your collection.\n\nMint\n\n6 Collected\n\nVerification\n\nThis entry has been permanently stored onchain and signed by its creator.\n\n[Arweave Transaction\\\\\n\\\\\nVmCdAEvJoMbYLl1…KPu7gdx3dlwWm3g](https://viewblock.io/arweave/tx/VmCdAEvJoMbYLl1AdDg8vOPy8VLdKPu7gdx3dlwWm3g) [Author Address\\\\\n\\\\\n0x70eCe45cDc64A76…C851578251363e3](https://etherscan.io/address/0x70eCe45cDc64A768f936Ccb8aC851578251363e3) [Nft Address\\\\\n\\\\\n0x746062AA1b5B193…0036Df62f7758BA](https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0x746062AA1b5B19392A04B2dac0036Df62f7758BA)\n\nContent Digest\n\nLCPVlxuOHJ2yCHv…2-Fk1lnOyHviIPc\n\nMore from Forefront\n\n[View All](https://forefront.mirror.xyz/)\n\n[iframe](https://verify.walletconnect.com/8c7ddeb3f10a28617e9790ab771214ed)",

Decisions may take longer than usual. Additional strong projects might be considered at a later stage.\n\nAs advanced AI systems proliferate, they will increasingly operate in environments populated by other AIs and by humans—with complex, often conflicting goals. This multi-agent context raises profound safety challenges and new opportunities for cooperation. Interactions between multiple agents—whether human, artificial, or hybrid—can produce emergent behaviors that are hard to predict, control, or align.\n\nWithout careful design, such systems could foster deception, collusion, power concentration, or societal fragmentation. Yet if properly guided, multi-agent systems could instead enable an explosion in technologies for mutually-beneficial cooperation, benefiting individual one-to-one interactions as well as society-wide collaboration on collective action problems. Building safe multi-agent systems is not just about designing good individual agents. It is about shaping the ecosystem of interactions, incentives, and norms that will govern how AIs and humans co-evolve together.\n\n## What we want to fund\n\nWe seek proposals that explore how to upgrade today’s cooperation infrastructure of norms, laws, rights, and institutions to ensure that humans and AI systems can interact safely and beneficially in multi-agent settings. We are particularly interested in prototypes that address new game-theoretic dynamics and principal-agent problems that will arise in interactions between AI agents and humans, mitigate risks of collusion and deception, and enhance mechanisms for trustworthy communication, negotiation, and coordination. We aim to de-risk the deployment of cooperative AI and create pathways where AI agents strengthen rather than undermine human-aligned cooperation.\n\nEarly demonstrations—such as AI systems that assist humans in negotiation or agents that autonomously identify and enforce mutually beneficial deals or detect and punish deception— could lay the foundation for a future where interactions among AIs and humans are predictably safe, transparent, and welfare-improving. We also welcome projects that lift collective intelligence at the group level, using AI to augment the processes through which groups form shared preferences, resolve conflicts, and coordinate action.\n\n## Specific work we are interested in\n\n### 1\\. AI for preventing collusion and manipulation\n\nScalable solutions that demonstrably prevent collusion, manipulation, or exploitation in agent-mediated agreements.\n\n- Scalable methods for detecting and mitigating new forms of AI deception and collusion against humans enabled by their distinct ability to communicate, commit and problem-solve.\n- Scalable methods for detecting and mitigating indirectly harmful social dynamics like polarization, groupthink, or majority tyranny in AI-mediated group settings.\n\n### 2\\. Pareto-preferred coordination agents\n\nAutonomous agents that can identify, negotiate, and enforce mutually beneficial arrangements between humans and other AI systems.\n\n- Mechanisms for credible commitment and agreement enforcement that enable trust in automated coordination.\n- Systems that lower transaction costs for beneficial coordination while preserving human autonomy and oversight.\n\n### 3\\. AI-enhanced group coordination\n\nAI systems that enhance collective intelligence and enable more effective group coordination around shared preferences.\n\n- AI tools that improve information aggregation, preference elicitation, and consensus-building in group decision processes.\n- AI-native institutions that leverage the unique commitment properties of AI systems to build new forms of cooperation and governance among human or AI systems.\n\n​​If you have a proposal which falls within multi-agent security, but does not align with the specific work we have outlined here, you are still welcome to apply. However, please note that such proposals are held to a significantly higher bar. We do not accept proposals that fall outside this area.\n\n## Our priorities\n\nProposals should clearly demonstrate how the work will enhance safety in multi-agent AI environments, with particular attention to preventing harmful emergent dynamics when multiple AI systems interact with each other and humans. We prioritize projects that:\n\n- Emphasize practical implementations that can be tested and refined in real-world multi-agent scenarios, rather than purely theoretical approaches.\n- Address power imbalances by designing systems that protect vulnerable participants and prevent unhealthy concentration of influence.\n- Incorporate robust safeguards against collusion, deception, and adversarial manipulation between agents.\n- Promote open source, transparent interaction protocols that make agent behaviors, incentives, and decision processes legible to humans and other systems.\n- Enable beneficial coordination while preserving individual autonomy and diversity of values across participating agents.\n\n## Previously funded work\n\nExamples of past projects we have funded:\n\n- _Socially Complex Multi-Agent Game Environments_ – Development of tools and training of agents in dynamic, socially rich multi-agent environments to enable both safety and capabilities research on cooperation, conflict, and emergent behavior.\n- _Emergent Collusion Detection in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning_ – Creation of methods for detecting collusion and collaboration among large populations of AI agents based on limited action observations, advancing early-warning systems for multi-agent risks.\n- _Active Inference Models for Multi-Agent Systems_ – Application of Active Inference theory to build bounded-rational agents with improved cooperative capabilities, reduced disempowerment behaviors, and more robust environment shaping.\n- _Multipolar and Game-Theoretic Simulation Platform_ – Construction of a computational model to simulate multipolar and game-theoretic dynamics among AI systems, enabling rigorous testing of cooperation and conflict scenarios at scale.\n- _Ph.D Research in Multi-Agent Safety at Oxford_ – Support for early-stage research careers focused on multi-agent system safety, helping to build a pipeline of expertise at leading academic institutions.\n\n## How to apply?\n\nComplete the application form linked at the top of this page. Applications are accepted year-round and reviewed quarterly. Submission deadlines are:\n\n- March 31\n- June 30\n- September 30\n- December 31\n\nProposals are first reviewed in-house for fit and quality. Strong submissions are sent to technical advisors for further evaluation. If your proposal advances, we may follow up with written questions or a short call. We aim to make decisions within eight weeks of each deadline.\n\n## Who can apply?\n\nWe accept applications from individuals, teams, and organizations. Both non-profit and for-profit organizations are welcome to apply, but for-profits should be prepared to motivate why they need grant funding.\n\n## Funding and terms\n\n- We award between $4.5–5.5M in total funding annually. Grants typically range from $10,000 to over $300,000, but we do not set fixed minimums or maximums. Applicants should request the amount they believe is appropriate, supported by a clear budget and scope.\n\n- We fund both short-term and multi-year projects. For longer or higher-budget work, we may disburse funds in tranches, with later payments contingent on progress.\n\n- We can fund overhead costs up to 10% of direct research costs, where these directly support the funded work.\n\n- Grants are subject to basic reporting requirements. Grantees are expected to submit brief progress updates at regular intervals, describing use of funds and progress against agreed milestones.\n\n- Tax obligations vary by country and organization type. Applicants are responsible for understanding and complying with any applicable tax requirements.\n\nFor full eligibility criteria, financial details, and documentation requirements, see our [Grant Guidelines and Conditions →](https://foresight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Guidelines-and-Policies.pdf)\n\n## Further questions or feedback?\n\nPlease contact us at [grants@foresight.org](mailto:grants@foresight.org)\n\n## Grantees\n\n![](https://foresight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chandler-Smith.jpg)\n\n### Chandler Smith\n\nCooperative AI Foundation\n\n\n![](https://foresight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/David-Bloomin-2.jpg)\n\n### David Bloomin\n\nMettaAi\n\n\n[view person profile](https://foresight.org/people/david-bloomin/)\n\n![](https://foresight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Jonas-Emanuel-Muller.jpg)\n\n### Jonas Emanuel Müller\n\nConvergence Analysis\n\n\n![](https://foresight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Keenan-Pepper.jpg)\n\n### Keenan Pepper\n\nSalesforce\n\n\n[view person profile](https://foresight.org/people/keenan-pepper/)\n\n![](https://foresight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Kola-Ayonrinde.jpg)\n\n### Kola Ayonrinde\n\nMATS\n\n\n![](https://foresight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Nora-Ammann-1.jpg)\n\n### Nora Ammann\n\nPIBBSS\n\n\n[view person profile](https://foresight.org/people/nora-ammann/)\n\n![](https://foresight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Joel-Pyykko-1.jpg)\n\n### Joel Pyykkö\n\nIndependent\n\n\n![](https://foresight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Roland-Pihlakas.jpg)\n\n### Roland Pihlakas\n\nSimplify (Macrotec LLC)\n\n\n[view person profile](https://foresight.org/people/roland-pihlakas/)\n\n![](https://foresight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Toby-Pilditch.jpg)\n\n### Toby D.

The **Community Energy Plan** confirmed that:\n\n- The community’s total electrical consumption for 2023 was approximately 666,500 kWh/year.\n- Amlamgog’s per capita electricity consumption is approximately 50% lower than the New Brunswick average (9,118 kWh/Person/Year vs. 17,600 kWh/Person/year).\n\n**The successful energy solution:**\n\n- Integrates into a microgrid serving the community of Amlamgog, resulting in a net decrease in the community’s overall carbon footprint while supporting the net zero energy goal (approximately 666,500 kWh/year).\n- Reduces total operating costs (excluding capital cost) compared to purchasing power from the New Brunswick Provincial grid (NB Power).\n- Delivers environmental, social and economic benefits for the community, reducing dependency and reliance on the provincial power grid, and unlocking economic opportunities for reinvestment in social programming and capacity development.\n\n#### Considerations & Barriers to Adoption\n\nThe Amlamgog Community Microgrid Challenge aimed to support Amlamgog in continuing to develop energy initiatives that identify viable solutions to address energy independence. Adopting distributed energy systems that lower the community’s carbon footprint and operating costs was a primary factor for a successful Challenge outcome.\n\nProposed solutions must have addressed key adoption challenges, including:\n\n- Seamless integration into the existing distribution network or a local microgrid serving Amlamgog.\n- Feedstock logistics, including source, long-term cost predictability, carbon emissions.\n- Siting considerations, particularly proximity to residential areas (e.g., noise impacts).\n- Operating costs that ensure cost savings compared with NB Power electricity rates. Models that result in a new revenue stream for the community (excess power sold back into the grid) could be a benefit.\n\n##### **Evaluation & Eligibility Criteria**\n\nEligibility Criteria:\n\n- Must be Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6+\n- Open to domestic and international technology solutions\n- Compatible with Canadian electricity grid standards\n- Designed for integration into a community microgrid.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\n- Cost-effective\n- Ease of integration into microgrid application with microgrid controller technology\n- Feedstock availability and transportability\n- Applicability to New Brunswick’s energy landscape\n- Operational cost efficiency\n- Maximized GHG reduction compared with NB Power grid\n\n#### **Lighthouse Energy Wins Clean Energy Challenge**\n\nForesight Canada and Amlamgog are proud to announce [Lighthouse Energy](https://light-house-energy-ka8i.vercel.app/) as the winners of the Amlamgog Microgrid Innovation Challenge.Lighthouse Energy specializes in stabilizing electrical grids by harnessing unused renewable energy—reducing electricity costs, and making clean energy more accessible.\n\nAs the Challenge winner, Lighthouse Energy will have the opportunity to pitch their technology to the Fort Folly First Nation community and support the development of the Indigenous Distributed Energy Demonstration Project, which will help Fort Folly First Nation reduce grid dependency, lower costs and emissions, and build long-term sustainability. Lighthouse Energy will also showcase their innovation at the [2](https://nsmtc.ca/ailes/) [025 Atlantic Indigenous-Led Energy Symposium](https://nsmtc.ca/ailes/).\n\nA clean, thriving Canadian economy starts with an inclusive future built on clean productivity. In New Brunswick, [First Nations communities are leading the way](https://climateinstitute.ca/?p=34974&post_type=publications&preview=1&_ppp=37b94a730e) with local energy planning, low-carbon buildings, and EV infrastructure. Partnering with innovators helps build on this progress and strengthen climate resilience.\n\n> > Our vision for this project is to create an open sandbox for innovation and creativity—a place where the community and youth can freely express themselves and have deep ownership.\n> >\n> > We want everyone to participate and benefit. **This is our chance to create a better future, one that honors Mother Earth and evolves over the generations to come.** This is our first gift to the protectors of this land, a seed that will help nourish and support a brighter tomorrow.\n> >\n> > **Mujtaba Murad Khan**Founder, Lighthouse Energy\n\n* * *\n\n### **Challenge Updates**\n\n#### **March 13, 2025:** Applications open\n\n#### **April 2, 2025:** Informational webinar ( [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBlpKQFUSY0))\n\n#### **April 25, 2025:** Applications close\n\n#### **June 10, 2025:** [Winner announced](https://foresightcac.com/challenge/amlamgog-fort-folly-first-nation-microgrid-innovation-challenge\\#winner)\n\n## Our Partners\n\nThe Amlamgog Microgrid Innovation Challenge is run in partnership with [Amlamgog First Nation](https://nsmtc.ca/members/amlamgog/) and the [North Shore Mi’kmaq Tribal Council](https://nsmtc.ca/).\n\n- [Fort-Folly-2024](https://nsmtc.ca/members/amlamgog/ \"Fort-Folly-2024\")\n- [nsmtc_logo_red](https://nsmtc.ca/ \"nsmtc_logo_red\")\n\n[iframe](about:blank)",

It is common for these initiatives to have a multi-signature wallet (multi-sig) committee responsible for managing and dispersing DAO-approved funds, following the terms agreed by the DAO via on-chain governance, as well as with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nThe [DAO recently approved the Multi-Sig Support Service (MSS)](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/47904929527582233304785161920776863155691990219898799848510210794906211250836), so there will likely be greater standardization and streamlined multi-sig operations going forward. Accordingly, the Arbitrum Foundation would like to share some ‘Multi-Sig Best Practices’ based on its observations of the existing DAO-related multi-sigs. It is recommended that DAO-related multi-sigs, including the MSS, follow the guidelines and processes outlined below to adhere to high operational security (OpSec) standards.\n\n### Signer Best Practices\n\n01. **Use Secure Hardware:** Maintain at least two hardware wallets with the same seed phrase. These hardware wallets should be exclusively dedicated to DAO-related multi-sig transactions.\n02. **Dedicated Devices:** Utilize a separate, dedicated laptop or device solely for signing transactions.\n03. **Unique Signer Addresses (Keys):** Use a unique signer address (key) for each DAO-related multi-sig wallet. Avoid reusing addresses (keys) across different DAO-related multi-sig wallets. Each unique signer address (key) can be generated from the same wallet (i.e. using the same seed phrase). All signer addresses must be shared with the Arbitrum Foundation to pass compliance.\n04. **Unique Payment Address:** If you receive compensation for performing multi-sig signer duties, use a separate address from your signer address(es) to receive payments. All payment addresses must be shared with the Arbitrum Foundation to pass compliance.\n05. **Transaction Simulation:** Always simulate transactions using Tenderly (available on Safe) to ensure the transaction performs as intended before signing.\n06. **Verify Information:** Double-check all relevant sources of truth, such as the on-chain Tally proposal, before signing any transaction. If in doubt, do reach out to the DAO Relations team at the Arbitrum Foundation ( [@raam](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/raam) and [@cliffton.eth](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/cliffton.eth)), and to fellow signers, to ensure that all details about the queued payment(s) are accurate as per the on-chain Tally proposal and agreement terms.\n07. **Exercise Caution and Seek Assistance:** If you are unsure about a transaction, do not sign. Raise any concerns with fellow signers immediately. If you encounter any technical issues, promptly ask for help.\n08. **Bookmark Essential Links:** Bookmark links to DAO-related multi-sig wallets or rely on pre-established, trusted sources. Avoid clicking on links provided by external parties.\n09. **Availability Notification:** Inform fellow signers at least 24 hours in advance if you expect to be unavailable or unable to sign transactions for any period.\n10. **Report Key Issues:** Notify other signers and the Arbitrum Foundation via email immediately if you lose access to your signing keys or suspect they have been compromised.\n\n### Setting Up a Multi-Sig Wallet\n\n1. **Initial Communication:** All signers should exchange email communications and share a signed message from the key to be installed. The message should include:\n\n- Ethereum account address: “\\[signer address\\]\"\n- A statement identifying the signer and the multi-sig wallet they are joining: “\\[Message: I am X and I am joining the Y multi-sig\\]\"\n- Signature hash: ”\\[signature\\]\"\n\n2. **Key Authentication:** Conduct 1-to-1 and group calls among signers to authenticate the signing key with the owner. Do not rely solely on Telegram for key authentication.\n3. **Clawback of Funds:** As the ultimate owner of its funds, the ArbitrumDAO should be able to clawback funds from any of its multi-sigs by executing a respective Tally proposal - which can be enabled if multi-sigs are set up using the Zodiac Governor Module, for example.\n\n### Adhering to Terms and Conditions\n\n1. **Review Proposals Carefully:** Always review the respective on-chain Tally proposal before disbursing any funds, as they are the source of truth for payment schedules, payment caps, recipients, and other important details. If you have doubts, please reach out to the DAO Relations team at the Arbitrum Foundation.\n2. **Follow Agreements:** Abide by the terms and conditions of any agreements made with the Arbitrum Foundation. For example, only sign transactions to distribute funds which (a) have been approved by the ARB Community per the Tally proposals, (b) have satisfied appropriate compliance measures (such as know-your-customer checks) and documentation (as applicable) as confirmed by Foundation and (c) comply with the [ArbitrumDAO Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution).\n3. **Conflict Resolution:** If there is a conflict among proposals regarding fund disbursement, contact the Arbitrum Foundation for guidance.\n4. **Compliance Confirmation:** Never disburse funds without receiving confirmation from the Arbitrum Foundation that all compliance and necessary background work have been completed.\n5. **Recipient Detail Changes:** If a recipient needs to update any details (e.g. the address for receiving funds), they must contact the Arbitrum Foundation to restart the compliance process before any payments can be made.\n\n### Communication Protocol\n\n1. **Telegram Group:** Establish a Telegram group that includes all signers and members from the Arbitrum Foundation’s DAO Relations team.\n2. **Multi-channel Communication:** Do not rely solely on Telegram. Regularly speak with fellow signers through calls to ensure clear communication.\n3. **Transaction Request Template:** When requesting signatures, use a consistent template. This could either be through a bot (e.g. Onchain Den) or a manual template that includes:\n\n- Nonce\n- Payment details\n- Amount\n- Compliance status\n- Multi-sig wallet name (avoid using links)\n\n4. **Transparent Queuing:** For greater transparency, the person queuing the transaction can record a Loom video of the process and share it with the other signers.\n5. **Record Keeping:** Maintain a shared record of payments made (e.g. on Google Sheets) with version history that tracks:\n\n- Recipient name\n- Recipient address\n- Payment amount\n- Compliance completion status\n- Recipient address confirmation\n\n6. **Transaction Confirmation:** Signers should confirm on their Telegram group when they have signed or executed a transaction.\n7. **Periodic Reporting:** Publish transaction summaries on the DAO forum at regular intervals (e.g. monthly) to maintain transparency.\n\n### Notification Process Between Arbitrum Foundation and Signers\n\n1. **KYC Completion:** ‘Recipient A’ completes KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n2. **Notification:** The Arbitrum Foundation informs ‘Multi-Sig A’ via email that ‘Recipient A’ is eligible for payment.\n3. **Acknowledgement:** ‘Multi-Sig A’ acknowledges the update with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n4. **Address Verification:** ‘Multi-Sig A’ verifies with ‘Recipient A’ that they control the KYC-approved address by requesting an on-chain signature, and sharing this proof over email.\n5. **Transaction Queuing:** ‘Multi-Sig A’ queues the transaction (or batch of transactions) and shares the details with other signers using a transaction form template, Onchain Den bot, Google Sheet, and/or Loom video.\n6. **Signer Communication:** Signers coordinate and confirm when they have signed the transaction.\n7. **Execution Notification:** Once the transaction is executed, ‘Multi-Sig A’ communicates this update to the Foundation and the DAO via the forum.\n\n### Key Terms:\n\n- **Multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet:** Wallet that requires multiple private key signatures to execute transactions.\n- **Signer:** Member of a multi-sig wallet\n- **Hardware wallet:** Physical device (often resembling a USB pen), that securely stores private keys, offline.\n- **Seed phrase:** Sequence of random words that stores the data required to access or recover private keys\n- **Signer address:** The public address (an ENS or a randomly generated string of numbers and letters), like an email address, of a member of a multi-sig wallet\n- **(Private) key:** Randomly generated string of letters and numbers, like a password, that allows a respective signer to sign and execute transactions\n- **Payment address:** Address of a member of a multi-sig wallet used to receive compensation\n- **Recipient:** A DAO stakeholder who receives funding from a DAO-related multi-sig\n\n- [Proposal -

The NFTs reference a ledger that stored the daily calculation of an individual’s reputation, thus providing an on-chain record of their participation in the community.\n\n[More info on the Questbook grant submission](https://new.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6&chainId=10&role=builder&proposalId=0x62b)\n\n**How is reputation calculated**\n\nTogetherCrew’s algorithm analyses conversations and maps the social graph. This graph is used to calculate then how much context someone has on the community. This is a Sybil-resistant approach that can be used for rewards, as a portable credential (proof of membership/participation), etc. For now, the NFT will just be used as a nice showcase of being a core part of the community here.\n\n**Isn’t the data incomplete**\n\nYes, many conversations happen in calls, in splintered telegram groups, etc. We don’t have a complete solution yet but we’re working on it. For now, these Reputaiton NFTs are an experiment with no financial gain attached.\n\n**Other uses of TogetherCrew**\n\nMultiple communities use TogetherCrew already (Optimism, Pocket Network, Aave, Celo, SingularityNET, etc etc) and we’re bringing the same benefits to Arbitrum. Communities have benefited from\n\n- using the behavioural analytics to identify promising community members and turn them into ambassadors,\n- automate personalised messages to those who disengage, and review community health indicators,\n- we’ve also partnered with scientists from the University of California Santa Barabara who’re using the anonymised Optimism data to research the fundamental properties of community networks.\n- tracking retention of new members,\n- helping with onboarding and proposal discussion (thanks to our future called Hivemind - an AI-powered Q&A bot that works as a research assistant using the community’s public data so you can ask e.g. “Has anyone discussed Reputation already?” and receive an answer)\n\n**What about privacy**\n\nWe only analyse data that’s already public or given to us by you (and only after receiving explicit, active consent so there shouldn’t be any surprises). If you’d rather we don’t analyse your public data, message us and we’ll blacklist you to make sure the algorithm is not analysing your public data. If you don’t want us to analyse your private data, no action is needed (just don’t go into the TogetherCrew Ui and register because then we’ll have the data you gave us to register. If you did register and now want your data deleted, just let us know and we’ll erase it).\n\n**What is the cost of this**\n\nFor now free, we’re already supported by the Questbook grant we received to build the DynamicNFTs. We hope to demonstrate value and potentially establish a longer-term relationship after.\n\n**What do the analytics look like**\n\nYou can see a product demo in our website [togethercrew.com](https://togethercrew.com/)\n\n**Any other concerns/questions**\n\nJust let us know! We’re committed to working with the Arbitrum community to make this a valuable and safe experience\n\n- [Research on context and retention](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/research-on-context-and-retention/26807)\n\n328\nviews\n2\nlinks\n\n\n[![](https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/danielo/48/5539_2.png)3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/danielo \"danielo\")\n\n[![](https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/ezr3al/48/14760_2.png)2](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/EzR3aL \"EzR3aL\")\n\n## post by EzR3aL on Jun 10, 2024\n\n[![](https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/ezr3al/48/14760_2.png)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/ezr3al)\n\n[EzR3aL](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/ezr3al)\n\n[Jun 2024](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-health-analytics-and-reputation-nfts-in-arbitrumdao/24859/2 \"Post date\")\n\nHi, some questions.\n\nYou are claiming that you are working with Aave? Who exactly are you working with? Is it the AaveDAO using this tool? Or just a few people? Could you name them?\n\nWhats the benefit over having this NFT over the existing tools like Tally & Karma that are already widely in use in the DAO?\n\nWhat the overall goal implementing NFTs?\n\n## post by danielo on Jun 10, 2024\n\n[![](https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/danielo/48/5539_2.png)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/danielo)\n\n[danielo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/danielo)\n\n[Jun 2024](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-health-analytics-and-reputation-nfts-in-arbitrumdao/24859/4 \"Post date\")\n\nThanks for your questions.\n\nWe got a grant from Aave to do a community health report for them before we had a UI. It’s been over a year now and I understand the tool is still deployed. I’m not sure if the grant committee is part of the DAO or the foundation or exactly their internal structure.\n\nTally is a voting tool so very different use case.\n\nAs for Karma’s reputation, it’s mostly a delegate tracking tool while TogetherCrew is more focused on enabling the community to see itself (using a range of techniques). Both tools are somewhat complimentary i.e. focused on different use cases.\n\nIn more detail, Karma focuses on delegates only and actions e.g. posting (as opposed to interactions i.e. with whom you’re engaging). While TogetherCrew’s available for every community member (delegate or not) and the use of network analysis allows you to understand behaviour very differently.\n\nNetwork analysis allows TogetherCrew to see what are the sub-communities in the DAO and thus make sure e.g. a proposer is not ignoring a different cluster, understands who’s likely overwhelm/spread too thin so you don’t pester them and instead can leverage connectors who have good context but are not overwhelmed, etc.\n\nAlso, from a reputation perspective, the score we calculate is based on how much context someone has, which is different from engagement. The point for governance rewards (or in the future governance voting power) is about having a broad overview of the DAO so one understands the tradeoffs and different concerns, which is somewhat correlated with being very active but it’s not the same thing.\n\nFinally, Karma doesn’t have anything like Hivemind (the Q&A bot).\n\n## post by EzR3aL on Jun 10, 2024\n\n[![](https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/ezr3al/48/14760_2.png)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/ezr3al)\n\n[EzR3aL](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/ezr3al)\n\n[Jun 2024](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-health-analytics-and-reputation-nfts-in-arbitrumdao/24859/5 \"Post date\")\n\nOkay interesting, i have never seen any community health report and I am an active delegate at the DAO for quite a while now. Surprises me to hear about it the first time.\n\n## post by danielo on Jun 11, 2024\n\n[![](https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/danielo/48/5539_2.png)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/danielo)\n\n[danielo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/danielo)\n\n[Jun 2024](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-health-analytics-and-reputation-nfts-in-arbitrumdao/24859/6 \"Post date\")\n\nLikely the community team didn’t circulate it more widely. Helpful brother is our contact as I understand from my team.\n\nNote it’s only recently the tool has enabled to give access to the UI to as many people as the tool admin(s) want. So they could configure it now in Aave so all the delegates (or even all community members who have joined the Discord) have access to the analytics.\n\nAlso, only Discord analytics are live in the UI so limited usefulness, but Discourse, Github, Telegram, etc are coming live soon.\n\nReply\n\n### Related topics\n\n| Topic | Replies | Views | Activity |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [Research on context and retention](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/research-on-context-and-retention/26807)<br>[Finalized AIPs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/proposals/finalized-aips/9) <br>[proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/tag/proposal) | [73](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/research-on-context-and-retention/26807/1) | 768 | [Jan 8](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/research-on-context-and-retention/26807/74) |\n| [\\[MetricsDAO\\] \\[DRAFT\\] \\[STIP - Round 1\\]](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/metricsdao-draft-stip-round-1/17511)<br>[Short Term Incentives Program (STIP) Round 1](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/archive/incentive-framework/14) | [3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/metricsdao-draft-stip-round-1/17511/1) | 618 | [Oct 2023](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/metricsdao-draft-stip-round-1/17511/4) |\n| [Keeping up to date with Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/keeping-up-to-date-with-arbitrum/19651)<br>[General](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/general/4) | [0](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/keeping-up-to-date-with-arbitrum/19651/1) | 979 | [Nov 2023](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/keeping-up-to-date-with-arbitrum/19651/1) |\n| [\\[RFC\\] ArbitrumDAO Governance Analytics Dashboard](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrumdao-governance-analytics-dashboard/25869)<br>[Finalized AIPs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/proposals/finalized-aips/9) <br>[proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/tag/proposal), [governance](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/tag/governance) | [58](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrumdao-governance-analytics-dashboard/25869/1) | 1.2k | [Apr 17](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrumdao-governance-analytics-dashboard/25869/61) |\n| [Team number: 18 + contribution score: develop an individual scoring system proportional to the total value of each person´s contributions](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-number-18-contribution-score-develop-an-individual-scoring-system-proportional-to-the-total-value-of-each-person-s-contributions/21548)<br>[GovHack Denver](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/archive/govhack-denver/42) | [2](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-number-18-contribution-score-develop-an-individual-scoring-system-proportional-to-the-total-value-of-each-person-s-contributions/21548/1) | 538 | [Feb 2024](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-number-18-contribution-score-develop-an-individual-scoring-system-proportional-to-the-total-value-of-each-person-s-contributions/21548/3) |\n\nTopic list, column headers with buttons are sortable.\n\nInvalid date\n\n\nInvalid date",

However, after 3+ years of live data emerging around decentralized networks, decentralized coordination is still a work in progress.\n\nDuring this period, 1kx has supported, invested, and participated in over 40+ DAOs and incubated/launched many ourselves. Through our experience, the case for decentralized resource allocation has a long way to go with finding a long-term viable model, with most DAOs experiencing major coordination failures such as the following:\n\n- Unclear consensus and clarity on core DAO activities and product strategy, leading to excessive spending and misallocation of community resources to misaligned initiatives.\n\n- Lack of oversight, feedback loops, and accountability of community initiatives leading to overhiring and working groups with unreasonably high burn rates and low output efficiency.\n\n- Inadequate contributor quality curation and accountability leading to a high amount of incompetent, low context individuals gaining senior leadership positions, leading to a further degradation of the community’s operating standard and contributor value extraction at the cost of the entire community.\n\n- Lack of data driven of decision making processes that lead to the governance capture of the community to contributors who brute force governance via beuracractic lobbying.\n\n- Bloating on the DAO’s decisional surface area to a point where collective governance contributors no longer have the adequate context to govern effectively, leading to over delegation and concentration of social capital to a few select voices who are time rich but not nessearily those creating real impact for the DAO.\n\n\nRather than trying to address these problems incrementally, 1kx looks to propose a surface area reduced model for the governance of Safe DAO’s resource allocation known as ‘outcome-based resource allocation’ (OBRA).\n\n# Outcomes-based resource allocation (‘OBRA’)\n\nThe OBRA model minimizes the focus on the governance of resource allocation to focus only on the following areas:\n\n**1\\. Goals & metrics:**\n\n- What are the vision, goals, and north star of Safe DAO?\n  - eg. ‘To become the asset management standard of web3’\n- What metrics does the DAO use to measure progress towards its north star?\n\n\neg. ‘# of multi-sigs deployed, TVL of multi-sigs, volume transacted via multi-sigs, revenue/token buy back rate, multi-sig market share\"\n\n**2\\. Strategy:**\n\n- What are the different approaches to achieving the DAO’s agreed-upon goals?\n  - Eg. ‘Focus on building more third-party safe modules to drive safe transaction volume, which would lead to more utility and thus greater TVL’\n  - Eg. ‘Focus on institutional crypto adoption to drive TVL’\n- We expect there to be three main categories of strategies:\n  - Adoption (focused on gaining greater adoption and market share)\n  - Value accrual (focused on accruing value to Safe DAO)\n  - Risk (focused on addressing and managing risk for Safe DAO)\n- Example of a strategy proposal template/framework:\n  - Goals and metrics the strategy looks to drive progress in\n  - Outline the execution strategy or thesis\n  - Detail around existing data or evidence to support this thesis\n  - Detail around any risks associated with this strategy\n  - If this strategy succeeds, what is the happy case?\n  - If this strategy fails, what would be some reasons?\n  - What are some example initiatives that would fall under this strategy\n  - Assessment of the strategy’s maturity and if there is additional data that needs to be collected for the validation of this strategy\n- We expect there to be many valid strategies that the DAO can adopt to achieve its goals. We should both carefully assess the validity of strategies while also focusing on experimenting and validating new strategies.\n\n- The maturity of each strategy and progress being made on each front should determine the level of resources being allocated by Safe DAO towards initiatives under that particular strategy\n\n\n**3\\. Initiatives**\n\n- Initiatives are work proposals that are funded by Safe DAO\n- Initatives are more traditionally thought of as more traditional ‘DAO proposals’\n- Example of an initiative proposal template/framework\n  - Which pre-approved strategy is this initiative driving forward?\n  - Which metrics and KPIs will the initiative be measured against?\n  - Who is the accountable initiative lead? (individual or organization)\n  - What is the initiative about?\n  - What resources are being requested from Safe DAO?\n  - What risks does the initiative entail?\n  - Timeline/roadmap of milestones for the initiative\n  - Are there any upfront funding this initiative needs at the beginning\n  - The requested $SAFE success reward if the team achieves all work milestones (vested token bonus for completion of work)\n- Operating procedures around initiatives:\n  - All initiatives must be driving forward an existing DAO strategy\n  - All initiatives are funded by streamed payments via a tool such as superfluid or sablier unless the sum of funds is < $10,000\n  - The proposer may request an initial lump sum to kickstart the initiative, but the lump sum may not exceed more than 20% of the total funding requested for the project unless the project timeline requires less than 3 month to complete\n  - The $SAFE success reward for the completion of initiatives will be locked up for 1 year, followed by a 1 year linear unlock via vesting contract\n\n[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/gnosis_safe/optimized/1X/ab66ec2e77e09d03e10d091ebc6e3bc0e3b89daf_2_1192x1000.jpeg)\\\\\nimage1472×1234 125 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/gnosis_safe/original/1X/ab66ec2e77e09d03e10d091ebc6e3bc0e3b89daf.jpeg \"image\")\n\n**4\\. Review:**\n\n- Safe DAO will operate on seasons lasting 4 months each consisting of a work period and a review period:\n  - Initial 14 weeks of operational focus\n  - Followed by a 2 week review period in which the funded initiatives of Safe DAO will be reviewed by token holders and delegates\n- During the review period, all initiatives with streams of funding are subject to review and be required to share progress updates - they however do not need to re-apply for funding and drive a proposal through governance if their pre-approved funding extends beyond the prior work period\n- The DAO will also review existing approve strategies and may also decide to remove supported strategies too\n- Any new strategies and initiatives for the DAO must be proposed before this period to be considered for funding or approval\n- If token holders and delegates wish to terminate an initiative, the rest of their approved funding are returned to the DAO (all unspent funds and unvested tokens)\n\nWe expect the first review cycles for Safe DAO to take a bit longer in practical reality but, over time, get to a better place of operational predictability. For the first review cycle that emerges of Safe DAO, we want to take extraordinary care to walk through the process carefully to educate all community members involved about the process and invest time with involving delegates.\n\n#### Voting thresholds for governing strategy, initiatives, and review\n\nWe suggest there be minimum thresholds in governance power for being able to vote on the DAO’s core strategies, initiatives, and review cycles as a means of encouraging coordinated delegation parties to emerge in the governance process while also discouraging low effort and low signal participation. We suggest the following parameters:\n\n- Governance on strategy: minimum 1% of circulating supply\n- Governance on initiatives: minimum 1% of circulating supply\n- Governance on review: minimum 1% of circulating supply\n\n#### Incentives for reviewing initiatives\n\nOnce the first review cycle emerges, there will be an open question on how to properly incentivize the review of this work, as this becomes an operational burden on token holders and delegates. We can expect professional delegates that take a delegate management fee on tokens to emerge as a result of such incentives. MakerDAO currently has a model for rewarding delegates ( [MIP-61](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP61#sentence-summary)), and we can expect a similar design to emerge here eventually.\n\n# Why no working groups?\n\nTypically working groups within DAOs are funded on an ongoing basis, with very little oversight where many critical decisions around strategy left for contributors to decide. By first defining strategies as a DAO via token holder governance, it enables clarity of operating strategy and direction for contributors to focus on contributing as opposed to overly involving themselves in governance and other areas of their core competency. Initiatives are then funded based on pre-approved strategies and curated based on their ability to efficiently produce metris driven results for the DAO.\n\nAs such, with Safe DAO, there are no ‘default’ working groups. While working groups may form and request resources to drive initiatives forward for Safe DAO, there are no ‘official’ working groups to which the DAO will default responsibilities towards. Any arbitrary individual or group will be able to apply to contribute towards the DAO via initiatives.\n\nWe instead look to foster many groups contributing to Safe DAO, some cross-functional, others specialized in certain functions. By assessing contributors based on metrics/KPIs and fostering a free market of working service provider options, the DAO is able to assess and reward its contributors in a manner that is politically minimized and free of governance capture from any single contributor group.\n\nThe goal here is to open up a free market for teams to offer bids for work in relation to the DAO as opposed to many of the other DAOs that ‘officiate’ working groups and their working group leaders into permanent positions purely based on being ‘early’ or having social capital in the community.\n\nWhile this model might introduce sub-optimal resource allocation towards initiatives, it is a design that minimizes the political friction of Safe DAO. We can think of the current status quo of working groups as highly inefficient government-subsidized departments and the initiative-based model as a free market-based model that encourages the formation of service providers for the state that operates under the pressure of competition and a free market.\n\nWhile a working group model for earlier stage DAOs might fit better due to the need to be more iterative with feedback loops and strategy, Safe DAO has product market fit and a natural monopoly. At a smaller scale, you can operate with greater uncertainty without the overhead of politics, but as you scale, the political environment is a variable you want to minimize.\n\nIn every case, we’ve seen an over-reliance on working group-based models suffer similar fates to centrally governed economies which we’ve historically seen to fail.\n\nIn this outcomes-based governance model, we look to place a heavier emphasis on debating strategies first before deploying resources and having metric-driven feedback review cycles on the DAO’s allocation of resources. reviewing the DAO’s work.\n\nSlow is smooth, smooth is fast.\n\n#### How do we retain crucial functions for the DAO without working groups?\n\nThere may be areas of critical function for the DAO that may need ongoing functions, such as smart contract security or full-stack security audits to which the DAO should look to create a risk strategy to which various service providers can bid for the ongoing responsibility required to be filled by the DAO. The difference here is that there will continue to be regular review cycles for service providers retained by the DAO and that there might even be several service providers that are engaged to support the same very initiative. We expect risk-based initiatives to be much longer than and steadier supported by the DAO as opposed to other initiatives surrounding adoption or value accrual, as these areas are far more dynamic than risk management.\n\n#### Design principles\n\n- Limit the scope of the DAO’s scope of governance and push complexity to the edges\n- Establish a resource allocation process that limits politics and rewards merit/data\n- Allow for bottoms up open source resource allocation and opportunities to contribute, but only if there is pre-existing clarity and due diligence around strategy\n- Keep it simple stupid (K.I.S.S)\n\n#### The evolution of Safe’s operating model\n\nThis operating model looks to soften the landing of Safe from a centrally operated organization into an open-source DAO. We expect this operating model to evolve as the core organization currently driving forward Safe gradually decentralizes over time. For the time being, this operating model simply looks to accommodate community-driven resource allocation toward grassroots initiatives.\n\n#### Non-resource allocation-related proposals\n\nThere will be many other proposals that are non-resource allocation related, such as smart contract parameters or token list upgrades, and we expect those to have their own set of processes governed as needed by the rest of the DAO. This operating model mostly has looked to zero in on resource allocation, which has been mostly been the number one point of failure in other DAOs.\n\n#### Governance references that inform our point of view:\n\n- Working group models often face sustainability challenges and sometimes lead to Principal-Agent problems or entrenched leadership\n  - [Index Coop Open Letter](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-coop-open-letter/4147)\n  - [ICC Communication on Reduction in Contributor Spend](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/icc-communication-on-reduction-in-contributor-spend/4307)\n  - [The MKR holder Confessional](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-mkr-holder-confessional/15164)\n  - [Gitcoin Compensation Sustainability](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/dao-compensation-sustainability/10604)\n  - [Gitcoin Treasury Runway Analysis](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-treasury-runway-analysis/11077)\n  - [Resiliency Challenges & Risks Register](https://ses.makerdao.network/resiliency/challenges)\n  - [Sushi Tries to Pick Up the Pieces: A DeFi Governance Case Study](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/30/sushi-tries-to-pick-up-the-pieces-a-defi-governance-case-study/)\n  - [Sushiswap Scandal](https://rekt.news/sushiswap-scandal/)\n- Without established KPIs or accountability, both contributors and funded projects lack clear goals and metrics to work towards\n  - [Governance Proposal 005 - DeFi Education Fund](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-005-defi-education-fund/12963)\n  - [Concern as Uniswap-backed ‘DeFi Education Fund’ dumps $10M worth of UNI](https://cointelegraph.com/news/concern-as-uniswap-backed-defi-education-fund-dumps-10m-worth-of-uni)\n  - [Thread highlighting lack of communication and updates from the DeFi Education Fund](https://twitter.com/cobie/status/1487456870696689673)\n- Too much human governance can result in potential attack vectors\n  - [MIP-13: Merit Circle: A New Era](https://gov.meritcircle.io/t/mip-13-merit-circle-a-new-era/469)\n  - [Twitter thread breakdown of Merit Circle events](https://twitter.com/itstimconnors/status/1536734104422522881)\n  - [SLND1: Mitigate Risk From Whale](https://app.realms.today/dao/7sf3tcWm58vhtkJMwuw2P3T6UBX7UE5VKxPMnXJUZ1Hn/proposal/HuaL6cDtuNtfnJgvwMnYiZDHVCoLAuDtVFgJD8kYChJ4)\n  - [The Problems of DAO Governance: GLF22 Survey Results](https://glf.digital/fa5a954c2cfd429ba60122cc3ac3189e)\n  - [Compound governance is disorganized](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-governance-is-disorganized/2135)\n\nOur goal here is not to refute the tremendous contributions these DAOs have made to the space for their experiments are necessary to understand the viable design space of coordination better but instead to acknowledge the risks involved and seek an alternative structure that accounts for these common pitfalls.\n\n# Next steps\n\n- Feedback from community members on this operating model\n- Ratify a revised version of this operating model as a DAO via a community vote\n- If the community ratifies the operating model:\n  - Propose a set of metrics and KPIs for Safe DAO as a community proposal\n  - Propose a governance framework for developing strategies (a way to propose new strategies and a process to validate them)\n  - Propose a governance framework for proposing initiatives (that drive forward approved strategies)\n\n====\n\nThis initial draft here aims to open up a conversation and gather feedback.\n\nWe’ll be iterating on the design and execution of this model per community discussion.\n\nps.

Thank you for writing it.\n\nWhy didn’t you make a higher threshold I wonder for Governance on strategy? Wouldn’t we want something “constitutional” to have a higher threshold? We wouldn’t want the Goals and strategies changing as frequently or easily as individual initiatives / proposals would we?\n\nI know this post is focused on OBRA as opposed the particular goals & metrics, strategy and initiatives. That said - I’d argue that the most important projects in web3 should have some component of their strategy being to grow web3 itself. My observation is that with only ~5k active developers in web3, we are still early days and need to all be intentional about 100xing that number in the years to come. What do you think?\n\nLast quick point - once metrics are agreed upon - would it make sense to have a function that gathers these? I’m new to the SAFE DAO and maybe there are already guardians or something doing this role in which case my question is of course moot.\n\n## post by OmnistratMatt on Sep 23, 2022\n\n[![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/forum.safe.global/omnistratmatt/48/701_2.png)](https://forum.safe.global/u/omnistratmatt)\n\n[OmnistratMatt](https://forum.safe.global/u/omnistratmatt)\n\n1\n\n[Sep 2022](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-safe-dao-resource-allocation-model-obra/1001/4 \"Post date\")\n\nI fully support an OBRA approach. Although reviewing and monitoring outcomes is critical, I believe the real power of this approach is the process it instills and what that process produces - a plan.\n\nFrom a messaging standpoint, I view this as having DAO governance move from a proposal-based approach to a plan-based approach. By plan, I mean having discrete objectives (what you call strategies) and the initiatives to achieve those objectives.\n\nThis is an approach I have spent considerable time researching, as a founder in the DAO coordination space and as a genesis core operator with Wilfdfire DAO (a meta-governance services DAO founded by the Fire Eyes team).\n\nReferring back to my renaming of strategies, I recommend a slightly different naming structure. I have thought long and hard about terminology (you need to because it is far more important than people realize) and this is the position I came to. DAO “seasons” are coordinated through a strategic plan. A strategic plan is comprised of objectives and initiatives.\n\nA strategic plan, if you think about it as an object contains the narrative for why you have this particular plan and it defines the time period you are working in. In the case of Safe DAO that would be four months. The objectives are what the DAO wants to achieve (or avoid). You can have multiple objectives.\n\nEach objective should have an unambiguous way to define what success means if the objective is achieved. These are the “goals and metrics” in 1k(x)'s model. You can see how it makes more sense to embed these in an objective rather than have the metrics across all objectives in a single bucket. For example, an objective could be, “To become a leading project in the web3 space” with a metric, “TVL is in the top 10 of all web3 projects”.\n\nFrom a process standpoint, the first step is to create a strategic plan (a name, i.e., “Safe DAO Season 3”, timeframe, and possibly a draft narrative). Then the objectives are proposed, debated, and decided on. Once finished, the draft strategic plan is opened up to the community to propose initiatives that support achieving the various objectives. The community debates and then approves or rejects the proposed initiatives based on the community’s belief in the outcomes they will produce.\n\nAt this point the final narrative can be written, the strategic plan “published” or made active, and the DAO can start to execute. The plan now becomes the communication vehicle for what this DAO is working to accomplish. A great onboarding and project management tool. I have lots of ideas on this as well but I’ll stop here.\n\nAnyway, these are my initial comments. I would enjoy participating in a working group to make this proposal a reality and to make Safe DAO a testbed for OBRA (aka, plan-based governance).\n\n## post by isaac on Sep 23, 2022\n\n[![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/forum.safe.global/isaac/48/161_2.png)](https://forum.safe.global/u/isaac)\n\n[isaac](https://forum.safe.global/u/isaac)\n\n[Sep 2022](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-safe-dao-resource-allocation-model-obra/1001/5 \"Post date\")\n\nI like this structure and flexibility of the OBRA model. It may be a good way to avoid ‘working group complacency’ where progress can grind to a halt when people get busy or don’t have clear KPIs.\n\nI’d consider adding something in addition to the $SAFE success reward for completion of initiatives that don’t go to plan. If a team fails to deliver wrt the metrics and KPIs outlined in the initial prop, they could recover some of the reward by presenting how and why they didn’t meet the expected goal so the rest of the community can learn & adapt.\n\nI’m not sure if this needs to be an explicit guideline or could emerge as a cultural norm, but I think it could minimize KPI/ metric misalignment.\n\nI also like having risk as a core strategy because it will encourage more meta initiatives that look at the long term resiliency of the DAO/ ecosystem. Although metrics for the risk category will be harder to define.\n\n## post by OmnistratMatt on Sep 23, 2022\n\n[![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/forum.safe.global/omnistratmatt/48/701_2.png)](https://forum.safe.global/u/omnistratmatt)\n\n[OmnistratMatt](https://forum.safe.global/u/omnistratmatt)\n\n1\n\n[Sep 2022](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-safe-dao-resource-allocation-model-obra/1001/6 \"Post date\")\n\n[@isaac](https://forum.safe.global/u/isaac) you bring up a critical point. Although, you may not realize just how big an issue it is. Right now, web3 comp is broken - badly. Most people don’t get paid for their efforts or are at the mercy of the crowd to retroactively comp them when they have no idea of the effort involved or the results achieved. They basically guess.\n\nMore to your point, paying for results makes complete sense, except when it doesn’t. Where it doesn’t is when a community is doing complex problem-solving. For these situations, these communities need to support experimentation to discover the innovation that solves the problem.\n\nIn an all-or-nothing payout mindset, you will get little to no risk-taking, resulting in just incremental advancement. We need to reward the experimenters and pay for their efforts even if the desired outcome was not achieved. In reality, a great deal was achieved. The community discovered a path that does not work (for this org, at this point in time, with the given resources).\n\nIf you set up an objective/initiative, plan-based model you’ll realize the initiatives competing for resources to achieve an objective are actually a set of possible paths to success. If the chosen pathway project (aka initiative) doesn’t pan out. The community can learn from it and now make a more informed decision of what the next-best initiative should be resourced to achieve the breakthrough result.\n\nWhen a community gets good at this process they will learn to fail fast, saving the remaining resources to be allocated to the next-best experiment. This is where I will add my next modification to the above model. I would not wait to do an end-of-season retrospective/review on the outcomes. I would make it an ongoing process. As soon as an initiative should be killed, kill it. Then move on.\n\nThe originally proposed process will likely lead to a major project management problem - the sunk-cost fallacy. This is to say, getting the project to the finish line, no matter what the evidence is saying, in the hopes that maybe the team can pull off success in the end. This wastes resources and is how many bureaucratic environments operate. The very orgs we’re trying to disrupt.\n\nThe end-of-season review should still happen. There still needs to be an accounting of the overall season results and for any non-experimental initiatives that ran for the season. Also, it’s good to stop and reflect and reset. This is when you can start the next season’s planning cycle by creating the next strategic plan.\n\n## post by jierlich on Sep 26, 2022\n\n[![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/forum.safe.global/jierlich/48/671_2.png)](https://forum.safe.global/u/jierlich)\n\n[jierlich](https://forum.safe.global/u/jierlich)\n\n[Sep 2022](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-safe-dao-resource-allocation-model-obra/1001/7 \"Post date\")\n\nAgree with a lot of this [@OmnistratMatt](https://forum.safe.global/u/omnistratmatt), specifically related to paying for effort not just results. Retroactive comp is unsustainable. I’d like to bring up two additional points here as well related to the comp:\n\n1. I’m concerned about setting 20% payment cap. This may block some contributors willing to give the DAO full focus that are unable to do so due to cash flow problems.\n2. We should look at paying in a mix of stablecoins and $SAFE. I’m unsure exactly what the mix should be, but paying in just $SAFE, which will likely be volatile for a time, makes financial planning difficult for contributors and adds structural sell pressure as many contributors will need to sell their tokens to pay for expenses.\n\n## post by jierlich on Sep 26, 2022\n\n[![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/forum.safe.global/jierlich/48/671_2.png)](https://forum.safe.global/u/jierlich)\n\n[jierlich](https://forum.safe.global/u/jierlich)\n\n[Sep 2022](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-safe-dao-resource-allocation-model-obra/1001/8 \"Post date\")\n\nI am in favor of most of this proposal overall, but have some comments (along with the response above related to comp).\n\n**First, a question**: How do tokens held by various “neutral” parties figure into `circulating supply`? Does the SAFE Foundation’s tokens count? The three community treasuries? The below comment holds generally, but the degree of it assumes `circulating supply` is as inclusive a definition as possible.\n\n**Voting thresholds:**\n\nGiven my current knowledge, I am against voting thresholds as it is a strong centralizing force. Additionally, the % indicated will exclude all individuals and guardians. Let’s take Guardians as a specific example. There are over 100 guardians ( [https://twitter.com/gnosisSafe/status/1539249613999308800](https://twitter.com/gnosisSafe/status/1539249613999308800)). It is unlikely any will have the ability to vote given 5% total airdrop allocation to guardians.\n\nLow signal / low effort participation is worth discouraging, but this does not seem to be the right path. It may make more sense to have thresholds (that can be pooled amongst delegates) for other mechanisms such as creating proposals, but not voting in them.\n\n**No working groups:**\n\nI suspect we will get good results from this approach, but expect it will come with new types of problems. I am particularly concerned with need to have explicit effort to either foster and share or codify institutional knowledge over time. Are there other teams doing this that we can look at as an example?\n\n## post by pet3rpan-1kx on Sep 26, 2022\n\n[![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/forum.safe.global/pet3rpan-1kx/48/728_2.png)](https://forum.safe.global/u/pet3rpan-1kx)\n\n[pet3rpan-1kx](https://forum.safe.global/u/pet3rpan-1kx)\n\n[Sep 2022](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-safe-dao-resource-allocation-model-obra/1001/9 \"Post date\")\n\nI set it to an arbitrary threshold that didn’t seem over imposing for the time being as we are always able to adjust it as needed. Goal right now is to approach it with an open mind and not overly think it.\n\n> I’d consider adding something in addition to the $SAFE success reward for completion of initiatives that don’t go to plan. If a team fails to deliver wrt the metrics and KPIs outlined in the initial prop, they could recover some of the reward by presenting how and why they didn’t meet the expected goal so the rest of the community can learn & adapt.\n\nI like the idea in theory and how it promotes operating and psychological safety but not sure how to design it so that the incentives align here. Eg. if you cap the failure token reward as a % of the total funding requested, you align incentives for teams to over promise and fail. This would be some sort of social security type safety for work. Not sure if this is appropriate as a first order means of distributing funding from the DAO.\n\nDisagree. The free market is comprised of all or nothing risk taking. The uncapped and large upside potential is what drives risk taking and that is what we should look to optimise for regarding the token rewards for completing entire projects/initiatives. We should look to significantly reward teams/individuals that are able to move the needle considerably.\n\nI don’t see how the cash flow situation can be different to any other job. You get a paycheck week or month to month, here the cash flow situation is much better given the fact that the funding is streamed. I’d rather operate first then iterate on this as needed.\n\nDAO contributors will receive a token bonus if they complete their work. If DAO contributors wish to receive more tokens for work, they can under price their cash compensation and ask for a greater token bonus. The DAO should ideally look to to raise stablecoin funding via OTC sales of tokens to strategic investors if possible as opposed to distributing tokens to contributors who eventually sell to much more passive and lesser strategic holders on the secondary market.\n\nYes, would consider any token not locked up inside Safe DAO’s treasury as circulating.\n\nGood point, open to lowering the thresholders. Initial levels were set pretty arbitrarily IMO. Might be good to observe the delegation levels to guardians and then approve the actual voting thesholders after.\n\n## post by OmnistratMatt on Sep 26, 2022\n\n[![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/forum.safe.global/omnistratmatt/48/701_2.png)](https://forum.safe.global/u/omnistratmatt)\n\n[OmnistratMatt](https://forum.safe.global/u/omnistratmatt)\n\n[Sep 2022](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-safe-dao-resource-allocation-model-obra/1001/10 \"Post date\")\n\nA good debate to have.

Are they two different aspects of the payout?

Fully in support of this cap, or even a lower one, given the streaming configuration.\n\nBy “cash compensation” do you mean compensation via stablecoins as the default for contributor streams?

While reading it I had lots of flashbacks regarding the discussion while we are developing Inverter. Inverter is a funding tool that aims to increase accountability and transparency while reducing administrative effort.\n\nThe mechanism of Inverter embraces a very similar approach that this proposal suggests for fund management.\n\nInverter **embraces milestone-based funding.** Such that, while creating a proposal, the working team has to set milestones and deliverables. Each milestone will have a budget and duration. The milestone budget amount will only start streaming to the working team once they provide the Proof of Completion document.\n\nAs you have stated, _“Without established KPIs or accountability, both contributors and funded projects lack clear goals and metrics to work towards.”_\n\nOne of the novel solutions that Inverter brought here is that the “approval” process of the proof of work document is based on an optimistic approach. Unless there is a disagreement with the document, the document will be redeemed as satisfactory. However, if the community **is not satisfied with the provided proof of completion document, they can interrupt streaming and withdraw their funds anytime.** This allows a built-in accountability mechanism that **does not require many approvals on each milestone** which involves lots of bureaucratic work but still protects funders from under delivery of work.\n\nOne may be concerned that in DAO daily work activities, it is hard to **perfectly define milestones** with objective outcomes or there may be under deliveries due to external reasons, etc. However, the idea behind providing proof of deliverable completion documents is to maintain the **consent of your funder,** not complete all the promises without any compromise. For example, the writing guild may promise to provide 3 articles this month but publish 2. However, if the community believes that those 2 articles were very good and satisfied with their performance. All they need to do is not withdraw their funds, which signals that they are satisfied with the provided work.\n\nAlso, inside Inverter, communities can provide **feedback** on proof of deliverable reports. This may be a suggestion for future reports or a request for a new report or any sort of feedback. That way working teams will have constant pulse checks.\n\nI believe one of the most important value add that Inverter can provide Safe DAO is the organization dashboard that it provides. Inverter provides an organizational dashboard that funding programs can see and get notified about\n\n- Who is already funding this proposal\n- Who is contributing to this proposal\n- Public discussions about the proposal in community forums\n- The proposal’s target funding goal\n- Established Milestones and Deliverables\n- Proof of Deliverable Completion reports\n- Feedbacks on Proof of Deliverable Completion reports from funder\n\nBeing able to navigate this important information for many proposals would help SAFE DAO to have a more transparent and easy time to manage its funding activities.\n\nI am looking forward to hearing your opinion. I believe there is a very interesting value alignmentthere. I would love to invite the Safe community to be one of the early tester of the product in our close beta launch. We would love to have a user interview with Safe DAO members to improve our product based on your needs !!\n\nHere you can check some documentation about Inverter:\n\nProduct Doc (Work in Progress): [Introduction to Inverter - Inverter Network-Docs (WIP)](https://inverter-network.gitbook.io/inverter-network-docs/)\n\nLatest Blog Post: [The birth of Inverter Network, Team and Feature Updates- Part 2 — Inverter Network](https://mirror.xyz/inverterblog.eth/94wdEuifUD3v68vAb1vrTZM7dNrBITovOwoE8zxNrY4)\n\n25 days later\n\n\n## post by vincent on Nov 22, 2022\n\n[![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/forum.safe.global/vincent/48/709_2.png)](https://forum.safe.global/u/vincent)\n\n[vincent](https://forum.safe.global/u/vincent)\n\n[Nov 2022](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-safe-dao-resource-allocation-model-obra/1001/19 \"Post date\")\n\nExcellent proposal and discussion - having participated in many DAOs and defi projects for some time, I think you have hit the nail on the head for many DAOs in terms of improving the incentives and focus.\n\n20 days later\n\n\n## post by pet3rpan-1kx on Dec 13, 2022\n\n[![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/forum.safe.global/pet3rpan-1kx/48/728_2.png)](https://forum.safe.global/u/pet3rpan-1kx)\n\n[pet3rpan-1kx](https://forum.safe.global/u/pet3rpan-1kx)\n\n[Dec 2022](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-safe-dao-resource-allocation-model-obra/1001/20 \"Post date\")\n\nI will be releasing a final form of OBRA to be pushed for community governance over the next month!\n\n- [Safe Grants Program (SGP)](https://forum.safe.global/t/safe-grants-program-sgp/973/26)\n\n## post by JoelCares on Dec 20, 2022\n\n[![](https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/9de0a6/48.png)](https://forum.safe.global/u/joelcares)\n\n[JoelCares](https://forum.safe.global/u/joelcares)\n\n[Dec 2022](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-safe-dao-resource-allocation-model-obra/1001/21 \"Post date\")\n\nI have read this a few times, slowly letting things percolate. Really appreciate you putting this thought out into the world.\n\nOn the first read I mostly connected with the idea of pushing initiatives to compete under the umbrella of a strategy, providing specific metrics to evaluate and compare them with.\n\nI’m realizing now, this could actually be a bit broader. I’m very interested in seeing measurable competition between strategies, providing an evaluation of different approaches towards the DAO’s goals, different mental models.\n\nThis begs the questions: how are strategies selected, and how are good strategies recognized and rewarded? What if any DAO member could permissionlessly propose new strategies and trial initiatives within them to prove efficacy. Trial strategies would have less rewards and therefore less competition between incoming initiatives. More mature, proven strategies would have higher rewards, fostering intense competition within them. Strategy authors would receive increasing rewards as more successful initiatives are completed under their strategies.\n\nMost importantly, trial strategies would provide innovators a permissionless space to iterate and improve the entire approach to meeting the DAOs goals. If the DAO has clear, measurable goals - a strategy could be evaluated simply as $ spent per unit of goal achieved.\n\nPermissionless strategy creation and competition would seriously minimize the amount of things the DAO needs to agree on. The DAO decides on the Goal, and the most important metrics of success. Strategies and initiatives evolve permissionlessly on their own, forced to compete and deliver measurable success.\n\n## Load more posts below\n\nInvalid date\n\n\nInvalid date",

We will work to ensure that the handover of responsibilities is as smooth as possible.\n\n## Introduction\n\nWe, [@Patrick\\_J](https://forum.sky.money/u/patrick_j) and [@LongForWisdom](https://forum.sky.money/u/longforwisdom), are announcing our decision to step down from the GovAlpha Core Unit at the end of August. We are sharing this news two months in advance to allow for a smooth handover of our roles and responsibilities.\n\nOur decision is largely based on the recent changes to the role of GovAlpha following the transition to Endgame. This shift has reduced our enjoyment and sense of fulfillment in our work, as we spend more time guiding others through a complex, ever-changing governance landscape. We feel that staying with GovAlpha and continuing to draw salaries while not fully invested in these changed responsibilities would not fully serve the DAO or ourselves.\n\nDespite our departure, we remain thankful for the opportunities that MakerDAO has provided us and our team. We believe it’s now time for us to move on to new projects where we can focus more on Governance Design and other interests. We’re committed to ensuring this transition is as smooth as possible.\n\n## Budgetary Considerations\n\nWe propose the following course of action:\n\n- Cancel (`yank`) the GovAlpha budget streams at the end of August (i.e. 23:59:59 on 2023-08-31).\n- Settle commitments to contributors.\n- Return remaining (DAI or MKR) funds to the protocol.\n- Convert non-DAI/MKR holdings (currently USDC and ETH) to DAI and return to the protocol.\n\n## Handover\n\nBelow is a list of responsibilities that GovAlpha covers (or are supposed to be covered by Governance Facilitators or FacilitatorDAOs under endgame), that we will prepare for handover to a DAO-voted replacement.\n\n### Executive Process\n\n- Governance-side Coordination\n- Determining Included Content with Technical Teams\n- Producing Executive Copy\n- Publishing Executive Vote\n\n### Polling Process\n\n- Ensuring poll requirements are met\n- Trying to ensure poll requirements are set correctly for different types of polls.\n- Producing Poll Copy\n- Coordinating with any front-end teams (currently Jetstream) to ensure portals match and correctly support any polling requirements.\n\n### Endgame Artefact Interpretation\n\n- Interpretation of the Endgame Atlas in the event parts of its conflict with universal alignment in practice.\n- Interpretation and Modification of the Endgame Scopes in the event that they conflict with universal alignment, or are preventing the effective operation of MakerDAO.\n\n### Endgame Arbitration\n\n- Arbitrating any disputes between entities in a Maker context.\n\n### Governance Administration\n\n- Maintaining AVC records and display on voting frontends.\n- Maintaining AD records and display on voting frontends.\n- AD + AVC compensation management.\n- AD + AVC onboarding and offboarding.\n\n### Endgame Alignment Enforcement\n\n- AVC Monitoring\n- AD Monitoring\n\n### Emergency Response\n\n- Ensuring ADs respond to contacts in an emergency\n- Emergency coordination role as needed\n- Emergency communication role as needed\n- Emergency Governance coordination for polls or executives.\n\n### Endgame Governance Scope Management\n\n- Sourcing Advisory Council Applications\n- Defining research RFPs\n- Managing Advisory Council Budget\n\n## Documentation\n\nTo support a successful handover, we will be delivering a series of documents over the next two months. Documentation has been coded for ease of reference and eventual indexing.\n\n- GHD = Governance Handover Doc\n- GHD-EXEC-01 - Executive Process Definition (in partnership with technical teams)\n- GHD-EXEC-02 - Executive Process Checklist\n- GHD-EXEC-03 - Executive Copy Principles\n- GHD-EXEC-04 - Executive Copy Creation Checklist\n- GHD-EXEC-05 - Executive Copy Review Checklist\n- GHD-POLL-01 - Poll Creation Principles\n- GHD-POLL-02 - Poll Creation Checklist\n- GHD-POLL-03 - Poll Review Checklist\n- GHD-POLL-04 - Poll Publish Checklist\n- GHD-AC-01 - AVC Onboarding / Offboarding Checklist\n- GHD-AC-02 - AD Onboarding / Offboarding Checklist\n- GHD-AC-03 - AD Compensation Spreadsheet\n- GHD-EG-01 - Endgame Interpretation Thoughts\n- GHD-EG-02 - Endgame Arbitration Thoughts\n- GHD-EG-03 - Endgame Alignment Thoughts\n- GHD-ER-01 - Emergency Response Recommendations\n- GHD-GS-01 - Governance Scope Advisory Council Suggested Requirements\n- GHD-SCSN-01 - Potential Successor Written Evaluations\n- GHD-SCSN-02 - Successor Exercises Record\n- GHD-META-01 - Governance Facilitator Responsibilities\n- GHD-META-02 - LFWs Random Stuff\n- GHD-META-03 - State of Maker Documentation\n- GHD-META-04 - Handover Report\n\n## Succession Plan\n\nOur recent call for contributors to GovAlpha had a secondary objective. We were scouting for individuals who have the potential to carry forward the work after our departure. Over the next two months, we plan to train interested participants, equipping them with the skills and knowledge required for the role. Should we identify individuals who demonstrate high calibre and suitability, we will make recommendations to Governance accordingly.\n\nAs part of offboarding, we consider it part of our responsibilities to do our best to deliver a range of viable options for Maker Governance to choose from as our replacements.\n\nExactly what structure potential replacements work under, terms, and prices will need to be negotiated between Maker Governance and the replacements in question.\n\nTo help ensure a base level of quality, we will run exercises and knowledge-sharing sessions to ensure that potential replacements have the best chance possible to fulfill the role without causing undue issues within MakerDAO.\n\n### Written Exercises\n\nWe will administer and provide feedback on a number of written exercises - the exact amount to be determined - in the following areas:\n\n- Creating executive copy\n- Creating poll copy\n- Endgame Artifact interpretation\n\n### Practical Exercises\n\nLikewise, we’ll run practical exercises around the most critical processes that take place under the Governance Facilitator’s responsibilities within MakerDAO. These will include:\n\n- Polling Process\n- Executive Process\n\nAdditionally, we’ll invite potential candidates to shadow us on various live calls that are required parts of those processes.\n\n### Knowledge-Sharing Calls\n\nWe’ll run a number of one-on-one and group calls with potential candidates. Likely we will start with one-on-one calls, and then schedule group calls when common misconceptions, confusions, and difficulties arise among the candidates.\n\nFurthermore, Patrick and LongForWisdom will be available to answer questions and discuss aspects of the role as candidates require.\n\n### Replacement Governance Process\n\nNear the end of August, we will administer a governance process with which to determine an _interim_ Governance Facilitator.\n\nGovAlpha will also deliver written evaluations of potential candidates prior to this interim vote.\n\n### Post-Offboarding Support\n\nAfter the end of August, Patrick and LongForWisdom will remain available for an additional two calendar months to answer questions and discuss aspects of the role with Governance-approved replacements to cover any issues that are only revealed over a longer term. In the event of an Emergency, Patrick may be able to make himself available to assist with response management - this will be contingent on a) availability and b) personal agreement that a scenario constitutes an “Emergency”. An hourly rate would be charged for this assistance.\n\nGovAlpha will not be exercising any Facilitator responsibilities, or retain any governance mandate beyond the end of August.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe timeline covers when we expect to deliver each handover document and a rough timeline for the implementation of succession exercises.\n\nDates are the Monday of each week from next week until the end of August.\n\n### 2023-07-10\n\n- GHD-EXEC-02 -

In the short time that I’ve been a delegate, I’ve received unwavering support from all of you. Both [@Patrick\\_J](https://forum.sky.money/u/patrick_j) and [@LongForWisdom](https://forum.sky.money/u/longforwisdom) have been sources of inspiration for me, and were a significant reason why I decided to join as a delegate. Your presence and guidance will be greatly missed. I wish you both the best of luck in your new projects!\n\n[![](https://forum.sky.money/user_avatar/forum.sky.money/frontier_research/48/25384_2.png)](https://forum.sky.money/u/frontier_research)\n\n[Frontier\\_Research](https://forum.sky.money/u/frontier_research)\n\n[Jul 2023](https://forum.sky.money/t/advance-notice-of-govalpha-offboarding/21281/5 \"Post date\")\n\nReally saddened (and, as a MKR holder, more than a little concerned!) to see this update and the departure of two of Maker’s finest. First and foremost, [@LongForWisdom](https://forum.sky.money/u/longforwisdom) and [@Patrick\\_J](https://forum.sky.money/u/patrick_j), you have given so much to Maker (the protocol) as well as Maker (the community of humans). Thank you for all the blood, sweat and tears you put into this place.\n\nI called GovAlpha indispensable many times during my time as a delegate at Maker. Unfortunately, we are going to have to find out what Maker governance looks like without their steady hand on the tiller.\n\nPatrick’s post should be **ringing alarm bells** for anyone even peripherally invested in governance at Maker: GovAlpha do an enormous amount behind the scenes to make this protocol tick, and it is a little terrifying that their responsibilities (including crisis management, executives, and Maker’s suite of emergency responses) will be in the hands of newcomers. I’m sure the handover documentation will be excellent, but there’s no replacing several years of institutional knowledge.\n\nThe Endgame transition promised a reinvigorated governance structure, but when GovAlpha leaves there will be nobody left with more than a few months’ experience in Maker governance. Frankly, that leaves the protocol vulnerable: to grifters, to charlatans, and to attackers. It warrants a deep rethink about how to steer Maker governance back to a place where contributors like Prose, Patrick and LFW want to devote their time and skill.\n\n[![](https://forum.sky.money/user_avatar/forum.sky.money/pedro_breuer/48/29010_2.png)](https://forum.sky.money/u/pedro_breuer)\n\n[pedro\\_breuer](https://forum.sky.money/u/pedro_breuer)\n\n[Jul 2023](https://forum.sky.money/t/advance-notice-of-govalpha-offboarding/21281/6 \"Post date\")\n\nI haven’t been around here for a long time, but I can say that [@Patrick\\_J](https://forum.sky.money/u/patrick_j) and [@LongForWisdom](https://forum.sky.money/u/longforwisdom) were always attentive and present to facilitate all the governance processes, which are not easy for newcomers.

This transition for many of us is emotionally hard. As I do in the “real world” - I can only throw a celebration party for anyone who quits their job. Jobs are universally terrible. Some more than others…\n\nWe are upset because of how excellent our departing friends have been in this community. We will dearly miss the way they contributed to our sense of fraternity, trust and “home”.\n\nBut as I try to recover from my pity party at seeing colleagues move on, I realize that it is precisely the way these departures are effecting me on personal level that is a problem for MakerDAO reaching its full potential.\n\nFor sure there are tons of talented and capable persons in the world. This project is likely a huge flashing neon light of possibility in the darkness of bear market non-opportunities and shitcoin BS.\n\nI don’t at all know if I have a great sense of how Maker can be a trusted and transparent project without the participants we have trusted before. But then, who is “we” in my prior statement? That would be a small group, teensy, tiny. A privileged club.\n\nSo, I’m hopeful that while change is hard for incumbents it is also an opportunity. Both for those who want to do new things and explore other horizons. And for the many who can become the trusted anons and contributors of the future. The bar has been set REEEEEAAALLY high. Like so so high.\n\nThank you [@Patrick\\_J](https://forum.sky.money/u/patrick_j) and [@LongForWisdom](https://forum.sky.money/u/longforwisdom).\n\n10 days later\n\n\n[![](https://forum.sky.money/user_avatar/forum.sky.money/mamun/48/25047_2.png)](https://forum.sky.money/u/mamun)\n\n[Mamun](https://forum.sky.money/u/mamun)\n\n[Jul 2023](https://forum.sky.money/t/advance-notice-of-govalpha-offboarding/21281/9 \"Post date\")\n\nAll the best for whatever comes next [@LongForWisdom](https://forum.sky.money/u/longforwisdom) [@Patrick\\_J](https://forum.sky.money/u/patrick_j)\n\nReply\n\n### New & Unread Topics\n\n| Topic | Replies | Views | Activity |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [Real-World Asset Report - 2024-12](https://forum.sky.money/t/real-world-asset-report-2024-12/25914)<br>[Sky Core](https://forum.sky.money/c/sky-core/92) <br>[rwa](https://forum.sky.money/tag/rwa), [real-world-finance](https://forum.sky.money/tag/real-world-finance), [reporting](https://forum.sky.money/tag/reporting), [financial-report](https://forum.sky.money/tag/financial-report) | [1](https://forum.sky.money/t/real-world-asset-report-2024-12/25914/1) | 116 | [Feb 4](https://forum.sky.money/t/real-world-asset-report-2024-12/25914/2) |\n| [\\[March 20, 2025\\] Final Native Vault Engine Oracle Migration Proposal - ETH, STETH](https://forum.sky.money/t/march-20-2025-final-native-vault-engine-oracle-migration-proposal-eth-steth/26110)<br>[Sky Core](https://forum.sky.money/c/sky-core/92) <br>[oracles](https://forum.sky.money/tag/oracles), [eth](https://forum.sky.money/tag/eth), [steth](https://forum.sky.money/tag/steth), [oracle-migration](https://forum.sky.money/tag/oracle-migration) | [3](https://forum.sky.money/t/march-20-2025-final-native-vault-engine-oracle-migration-proposal-eth-steth/26110/1) | 217 | [Mar 14](https://forum.sky.money/t/march-20-2025-final-native-vault-engine-oracle-migration-proposal-eth-steth/26110/4) |\n| [A Video Primer: Agents, Sky Primitives & the AI-native Atlas](https://forum.sky.money/t/a-video-primer-agents-sky-primitives-the-ai-native-atlas/26355)<br>[Sky Core](https://forum.sky.money/c/sky-core/92) <br>[governance](https://forum.sky.money/tag/governance), [atlas](https://forum.sky.money/tag/atlas), [atlas-workshops](https://forum.sky.money/tag/atlas-workshops), [governance-ai-tools](https://forum.sky.money/tag/governance-ai-tools) | [0](https://forum.sky.money/t/a-video-primer-agents-sky-primitives-the-ai-native-atlas/26355/1) | 277 | [May 7](https://forum.sky.money/t/a-video-primer-agents-sky-primitives-the-ai-native-atlas/26355/1) |\n| [Parameter Changes Proposal - June 16, 2025](https://forum.sky.money/t/parameter-changes-proposal-june-16-2025/26653)<br>[Sky Core](https://forum.sky.money/c/sky-core/92) <br>[sta-parameter-update](https://forum.sky.money/tag/sta-parameter-update) | [1](https://forum.sky.money/t/parameter-changes-proposal-june-16-2025/26653/1) | 155 | [Jun 16](https://forum.sky.money/t/parameter-changes-proposal-june-16-2025/26653/2) |\n| [USDS & SKY Payments Transition Update](https://forum.sky.money/t/usds-sky-payments-transition-update/25909)<br>[Sky Core](https://forum.sky.money/c/sky-core/92) | [0](https://forum.sky.money/t/usds-sky-payments-transition-update/25909/1) | 110 | [Jan 30](https://forum.sky.money/t/usds-sky-payments-transition-update/25909/1) |\n\nTopic list, column headers with buttons are sortable.\n\n### Want to read more?

I read some books and articles, but I have not yet had the opportunity to experience it first hand. Having said that, the more we are trying to figure out things for the core units the more attractive this concept seems in the context of managing distributed organisations.\n\nIt also seems in sync with the mindset presented by MakerDAO as a whole.\n\nHave any of you entertained the idea of applying some (or all) ideas described by the umbrella term of “holacracy” to the newly forming Core Units?\n\n…or maybe MakerDAO is already an holacracy but not called like that?\n\nI would much appreciate a discussion on this topic.\n\n> BTW, this is my first post here.\n>\n> I am Paweł and I am working as an engineer in the Oracle / Backend Services Team at Maker.\n\n- [The Menu Method - a brainsnack](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-menu-method-a-brainsnack/5935/10)\n\n3.5k\nviews\n30\nlikes\n5\nlinks\n7\nusers\n\n\n[![](https://forum.sky.money/user_avatar/forum.sky.money/teghnet/48/9975_2.png)3](https://forum.sky.money/u/teghnet \"teghnet\")\n\n[![](https://forum.sky.money/user_avatar/forum.sky.money/psychonaut/48/133_2.png)2](https://forum.sky.money/u/psychonaut \"psychonaut\")\n\n[![](https://forum.sky.money/user_avatar/forum.sky.money/longforwisdom/48/62_2.png)](https://forum.sky.money/u/LongForWisdom \"LongForWisdom\")\n\n[![](https://forum.sky.money/user_avatar/forum.sky.money/ccc/48/8036_2.png)](https://forum.sky.money/u/ccc \"ccc\")\n\n[![](https://forum.sky.money/user_avatar/forum.sky.money/kryptoknight/48/9910_2.png)](https://forum.sky.money/u/KryptoKnight \"KryptoKnight\")\n\n[![](https://forum.sky.money/user_avatar/forum.sky.money/longforwisdom/48/62_2.png)](https://forum.sky.money/u/longforwisdom)\n\n[LongForWisdom](https://forum.sky.money/u/longforwisdom)\nRegular\n\n\n[Jul 2021](https://forum.sky.money/t/holacracy-does-anyone-have-experience-with-the-concept/9314/2 \"Post date\")\n\nHonestly, it sounds very similar to stuff we’re already doing. Though I don’t think anyone ever sat down and said ‘let’s make this a holacracy.’\n\nSome examples:\n\n> “Some have described the authority paradigm in Holacracy as completely opposite to the one of the traditional management hierarchy; instead of needing permission to act or innovate, Holacracy gives blanket authority to take any action needed to perform the work of the roles, unless it is restricted via policies in governance or it involves spending some assets of the organization (money, intellectual property, etc.)”\n\nWe do this, at least, we try to. I wrote a [post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/ask-forgiveness-not-permission-five-tenets-for-a-productive-dao/749) about it ages ago.\n\n> “Holacracy specifies a tactical meeting process that every circle goes through usually on a weekly basis. This process includes different phases to report on relevant data, share updates on projects, and open discussions where any circle member can add to the agenda.”\n\nWe do this at GovAlpha, I’m fairly sure that other CU’s have similar meetings. The whole open-agenda thing is practiced pretty widely as well (again, at least at meetings in which I’m present.)\n\n> \" Holacracy structures the various roles in an organization in a system of self-organizing (but not self-directed) circles. Circles are organized hierarchically, and each circle is assigned a clear purpose and accountabilities by its broader circle. However, each circle has the authority to self-organize internally to best achieve its goals. Circles conduct their own governance meetings, assign members to fill roles, and take responsibility for carrying out work within their domain of authority. Circles are connected by _two_ roles known as “lead link” and “rep link”, which sit in the meetings of both their circle and the broader circle to ensure alignment with the broader organization’s mission and strategy.\"\n\nSo this is the part that we’re half doing. I would say that we have circles, but not a hierarchy of circles (at least not explicitly, at least not yet). One could potentially describe our circle hierarchy as:\n\nMultiple Core Unit Circles → Mandated Actors Circle → Governance / Community in General.\n\nAt the least, the mandated actors circle is starting to act a bit like a higher-tier circle over the core units.\n\n* * *\n\nSo yeah, pretty interesting parallel to draw. Honestly adopting this model more intentionally might be to our benefit, given that we have some weaknesses in areas that this may solve.\n\nOn the other hand, there is already a fair amount of administrative overhead just with the requirements for governance and transparency - so maybe we don’t want to add additional administrative overhead that this sort of structure would bring.\n\n[![](https://forum.sky.money/user_avatar/forum.sky.money/flipflopflapdelegate/48/24350_2.png)](https://forum.sky.money/u/flipflopflapdelegate)\n\n[flipflopflapdelegate](https://forum.sky.money/u/flipflopflapdelegate)\nVote on 100 Governance Polls\n\n\n[![](https://makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/2X/5/5632cb67ce8fc755cb80589c9c56e244545ec51d.png)](https://forum.sky.money/badges/107/send-20-dai?username=flipflopflapdelegate)[![](https://makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/2X/a/a209fb213b5711926b46fb6ba792e6b674040b40.png)](https://forum.sky.money/badges/108/vote-on-a-governance-poll?username=flipflopflapdelegate)[![](https://makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/2X/9/90b552a89abf24b61aacc14044476a4e5275b206.png)](https://forum.sky.money/badges/109/vote-on-5-governance-polls?username=flipflopflapdelegate)[![](https://makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/2X/0/09a9ef197ea1e99cf4aff221d8d53d40c07510f3.png)](https://forum.sky.money/badges/110/vote-on-10-governance-polls?username=flipflopflapdelegate)[![](https://makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/2X/f/f0460b0c4ad1892827f22afd3386527ae94a2c2e.png)](https://forum.sky.money/badges/111/vote-on-20-governance-polls?username=flipflopflapdelegate)[![](https://makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/2X/d/d94174702d59497eb4a0c5fb76f79326e36ee5ff.png)](https://forum.sky.money/badges/113/vote-on-100-governance-polls?username=flipflopflapdelegate)[![](https://makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/2X/e/ef7b3cfd403cd4fcfd4255a2008cac1b33b5e5c8.png)](https://forum.sky.money/badges/114/vote-on-2-consecutive-governance-polls?username=flipflopflapdelegate)[![](https://makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/2X/c/c16293621b341ad8ecb743a17579d1b6bb68ed02.png)](https://forum.sky.money/badges/116/vote-on-10-consecutive-governance-polls?username=flipflopflapdelegate)[![](https://makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/2X/1/171c22fc9af886197d31f494014d147878d07fe3.png)](https://forum.sky.money/badges/117/vote-on-an-executive-proposal?username=flipflopflapdelegate)[![](https://makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/2X/2/28d88e295d22c9ae1971f0b2b68984caccaefb67.png)](https://forum.sky.money/badges/118/vote-on-5-executive-proposals?username=flipflopflapdelegate)[![](https://makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/2X/4/47490a73610d444d4dac2fc932146a9a338a5cff.png)](https://forum.sky.money/badges/119/vote-on-10-executive-proposals?username=flipflopflapdelegate)[![](https://makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/2X/c/c60c69576dc41886dd6005ac7f21663264c12344.png)](https://forum.sky.money/badges/122/first-executive-voter?username=flipflopflapdelegate)[![](https://makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/2X/4/404c53763ed793cd1d8fd4f4408af4e2c23d503f.png)](https://forum.sky.money/badges/123/first-governance-poller?username=flipflopflapdelegate)\n\n[Jul 2021](https://forum.sky.money/t/holacracy-does-anyone-have-experience-with-the-concept/9314/3 \"Post date\")\n\nWelcome to MakerDAO [@teghnet](https://forum.sky.money/u/teghnet)!

Check out his book [Brave New Work](https://www.bravenewwork.com/). DAOs are mentioned briefly in the book. Also, Aaron and some of his staff at [The Ready](https://theready.com/) run a [podcast](https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/bravenewwork?selected=TR2420252733) that has conversations with guests about innovative corporate management structures. Aaron recently started a software-as-a-service project [Murmur](https://www.murmur.com/) that aims to automate some of his ideas (similar to Maker’s MIPs).\n\n[![](https://forum.sky.money/user_avatar/forum.sky.money/ccc/48/8036_2.png)](https://forum.sky.money/u/ccc)\n\n[ccc](https://forum.sky.money/u/ccc)\n\n[Jul 2021](https://forum.sky.money/t/holacracy-does-anyone-have-experience-with-the-concept/9314/6 \"Post date\")\n\nIndeed, it’s difficult to imagine a total holocracy where you have token holders that wield a good portion of the power; that sort of naturally imposes a management hierarchy. So it seems to me that what you end up with is a management hierarchy with a holocracy encapsulated somewhere vaguely within it.\n\n[![](https://forum.sky.money/user_avatar/forum.sky.money/teghnet/48/9975_2.png)](https://forum.sky.money/u/teghnet)\n\n[teghnet](https://forum.sky.money/u/teghnet)[Oracle Core Unit Team](https://forum.sky.money/g/Oracles-Core-Unit)\n\n[Jul 2021](https://forum.sky.money/t/holacracy-does-anyone-have-experience-with-the-concept/9314/7 \"Post date\")\n\nThis is a valid point.

It’s about an hour a week, not a big time investment, and sometimes you get an idea how some aspect of business management can be improved. I don’t think it is important to do something like Holacracy by the book. It’s more important to make incremental improvements. I mean, a large part of Holacracy is the idea that business processes should not be allowed to ossify to the point that the ossified process becomes antagonistic to the goals of the business.\n\n[![](https://forum.sky.money/user_avatar/forum.sky.money/kryptoknight/48/9910_2.png)](https://forum.sky.money/u/kryptoknight)\n\n[KryptoKnight](https://forum.sky.money/u/kryptoknight)\n\n[Jul 2021](https://forum.sky.money/t/holacracy-does-anyone-have-experience-with-the-concept/9314/9 \"Post date\")\n\nOn a strategy/management level, Maker’s core unit structure sounds rather similar to a holacracy. However, the governance process not so much:\n\n> Holacracy specifies a structured process known as “integrative decision making” for proposing changes in governance and amending or objecting to proposals. This is not a consensus-based system, not even a consent-based system, but one that integrates relevant input from all parties and ensures that the proposed changes and objections to those changes are anchored in the roles’ needs (and through them, the organization’s needs), rather than people’s preferences or ego.\n\nI’m not sure I understand how this “integrative decision making” actually works in practice, or if it could even apply in our case. Are there any examples?\n\n13 days later\n\n\n[![](https://forum.sky.money/user_avatar/forum.sky.money/teghnet/48/9975_2.png)](https://forum.sky.money/u/teghnet)\n\n[teghnet](https://forum.sky.money/u/teghnet)[Oracle Core Unit Team](https://forum.sky.money/g/Oracles-Core-Unit)\n\n[Jul 2021](https://forum.sky.money/t/holacracy-does-anyone-have-experience-with-the-concept/9314/10 \"Post date\")\n\nThank you all for very insightful responses.

      "content": "[Back to Discussion List](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/)\n\n### **OIP-41 - Updated Proposal - Olympus Incubator**\n\nPlease note further minor amendments separating the project budget from the DAO OHM and bringing advice and assistance of DAO members under the program budget at 10% of program funds. Please note major amendment concerning the solution to the impracticality of community AMA's in some cases.\n\n### **Summary**\n\nSeek authority from the community to launch an Olympus Incubator program - governed by a program committee of known DAO contributors involved in the establishment of this project.\n\nThe program will incubate new protocols that utilize or build on OHM or other Olympus products. In exchange, they will provide Olympus a share of their governance token - as negotiated by DAO contributors and approved by the program committee. Wherever possible, the community will have the opportunity to engage with a protocol at the time of approval through an AMA - and will have the opportunity to bring an OIP to remove a program participant if they believe it is in the community's interests to do so.\n\nAs a part of the proposal, the program committee seeks authority from the community for a separate budget of $3.5 million from DAO reserved OHM - to be dispersed using current multisig signers managing DAO funds to:\n\n- distribute a maximum of up to $250K in DAO reserved OHM per an incubated project as directed by the program committee from time to time, over the life of an incubation.\n\nIn addition, up to 10% of the program budget may be dispersed to:\n\n- DAO contributors (including committee members other than for participating in approval meetings) assisting the committee in administering the program\n\n- DAO contributors providing advice & assistance to incubated protocols.\n\n\nUnused funds will be returned to the DAO OHM pool should the program not continue.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nAt our current size and market cap we have the bandwidth to provide outsized value to new budding protocols with:\n\n- community bootstrapping\n\n- exposure and promotion\n\n- advice and assistance\n\n- early funding\n\n- access to our launch and liquidity products\n\n- early usage of a protocol by Ohmies\n\n\nSince we never sell tokens we receive to our Treasury and have large scope to assist with early liquidity - we make an ideal early partner for projects instead of having to sell out to mercenary VC capital.\n\nInvesting resources early in a promising project - in exchange for a portion of their governance token - provides outsized returns for OHM holders through increased backing value of each OHM.\n\nThe main agenda of this program is uses, integrations, liquidity and treasuries in OHM - we are a currency and need to be used. Of course, there is great potential upside for the Olympus treasury also - for example, if we paid $100K in OHM and received 5% of a protocol's governance token - then that protocol goes on to achieve a $500 million protocol fully diluted valuation - the DAO would have turned $100K into $25,000,000 in Treasury assets - a 250x return. The return on governance tokens is additional to the main game which is use of OHM.\n\nWe have identified and received in-principle agreement with a launch partner for this product - which can proceed to community consultation if this passes governance.\n\n### **Proposal**\n\nApprove Olympus Incubator program for a trial period of 90 days with a budget of $3.5 million from DAO reserved OHM. The program will be overseen by a committee of 7 DAO contributors known in the community. These contributors have been involved in setting up the program they are:\n\n1. JaLa\n\n2. Glueeater\n\n3. Tex\n\n4. Wollemipine\n\n5. Indigo\n\n6. Unbanksy\n\n7. Mark11\n\n\nAs a part of the proposal, the program committee seeks authority from the community for a separate budget of $3.5 million from DAO reserved OHM - to be dispersed using current multisig signers managing DAO funds to:\n\n- distribute a maximum of up to $250K in DAO reserved OHM per an incubated project as directed by the program committee from time to time, over the life of an incubation.\n\nIn addition, up to 10% of the program budget may be dispersed to:\n\n- DAO contributors (including committee members other than for participating in approval meetings) administering the program\n\n- DAO contributors providing advice & assistance to incubated protocols.\n\n\nUnused funds will be returned to the DAO OHM pool should the program not continue.\n\nAt the end of the 90 days, the program committee will provide a report concerning the program - including recommendations on further measures to include the community in the selection of projects moving forward and any other improvements that could be made to the program.\n\nAfter receiving feedback from the community, the program committee will propose the parameters for an ongoing program and then proceed to a governance vote. During this process, the program committee and DAO will continue to be able to onboard projects and work with projects already onboarded - as long as it remains within the approved $3.5 million expenditure cap.\n\nThe primary considerations of the committee for approval of a project will include:\n\n- Prospects of success of the project including development to date\n\n- Value derived to OHM holders through utility or integration of OHM or other Olympus products\n\n- Qualifications, experience and reputation of the founders/team\n\n- Resources required of the DAO compared to the in-principle terms-of-agreement for the project to be included in the program\n\n\nSecondary considerations will include:\n\n- Connection to, and reputation in, the Olympus community of the founders/team\n\nThe program will provide the following:\n\nCapital\n\n- Allow the DAO to distribute a maximum of up to $250K in OHM per an incubated project over the life of the incubation from the DAO reserved OHM.\n\nDistribution\n\n- Exposure and coverage in our social media and discord servers.\n\nGo-to-Market Expertise\n\n- Recruitment assistance from our Olympus community network of DeFi natives\n\n- Advice and assistance when required from highly skilled Olympus DAO members - with expenses covered by Olympus DAO - including community building, content creation, marketing, front-end and backend assistance, advice and review.\n\n\nEnd-to-End Liquidity Needs\n\n- Priority access - with reduced or waived fees - to our upcoming launch and liquidity products.\n\nTerms\n\n- The incubated protocol will provide a percentage of their governance token - as negotiated by the DAO contributors and approved by the program committee.\n\nExample process for onboarding a project to the program\n\nWhile the selection and onboarding will be iterative and improve over time - an example of how an onboarding will happen is as follows:\n\n- A project fills out an onboarding form requiring it to disclose specific information\n\n- The form is reviewed including review of pitch material and involvement in past projects by the DAO contributors\n\n- If there are no red flags, the project will be invited for a discovery call - this will include a discussion of the project’s ambitions, roadmap, development to date, tokenomics, current token allocations and the type of arrangement that would make sense for the project if it were to be accepted for incubation. This will be led by the DAO contributors and include at least one committee member wherever possible\n\n- The DAO contributors will prepare an assessment of each project including:\n\n  - Prospects of success of the project including development to date\n\n  - Value derived to OHM holders through utility or integration of OHM or other Olympus products\n\n  - Qualifications, experience and reputation of the founders/team\n\n  - Resources required of the DAO compared to the in-principle terms of agreement for the project to be included in the program\n\n  - Connection to, and reputation in, the Olympus community of the founders/team\n- The committee will meet on a regular basis to select program candidate’s inclusion in the program in-principle\n\n- Following in principle selections, the terms of the incubation would then be settled by the DAO contributors and approved by the program committee.\n\n\nThere has been a lot of debate about the appropriate mechanism for community inclusion in the selection of projects. There are good reasons to include the community in a decision-making process:\n\n-it is the ultimate authority of Olympus\n\n-community buy-in to projects will drive attention and engagement to the incubated project\n\n-it will ensure the committee is not including projects that are not approved by the community.\n\nThere are also a number of considerations that make it impracticable to engage community decision making in every case:\n\n-making an informed decision may require access to information that is subject to a non-disclosure agreement\n\n-it may not be in the incubated project's best interests to publicly appear at an AMA to discuss the innovation or design of the protocol at the time of the commencement of an incubation\n\n-if projects are regularly joining the program it may lead to clustering of required AMA's and community decision-making fatigue leading to lower engagement in other important decision-making processes.\n\nI propose the solution to this is that the committee undertakes to require an AMA and high-level disclosure of the terms of agreement with an incubated protocol - at the earliest available opportunity - taking into account the interest of the incubated protocol's success. This will often be at the initial time the incubation is approved by the program committee.\n\nProjects approved by the committee will be optimistically accepted into the program - with the caveat that at any time any member of the community may introduce an OIP to remove a protocol from the program if they believe it is in the community's best interests to do so.\n\nFinancial Risk Controls\n\nSome of the proposed financial risk controls include:\n\n- Staggering seed capital through milestone payments\n\n- Payments being made from an Olympus multisig wallet to a project multi-signature wallets with a majority of known entities - including pseudonymous entities with sufficient reputation\n\n- Preference for dealing with parties where their identity is known or they are pseudonymous entities with sufficient reputation\n\n- Use of SAFTs where practicable\n\n- Regular accounting to the community of funds dispersed by the program and compliance with financial risk controls\n\n\nReputational Risk Controls\n\nSome of the proposed reputational risk controls include:\n\n- A morality clause in the agreements to prevent projects bringing Olympus into disrepute\n\n- Preference for project founders/teams with industry reputation\n\n- Preference for dealing with parties where their identity is known or they are pseudonymous entities with sufficient reputation\n\n- Requirements for audit/code-reviews of new codebases used before main-net release\n\n- Regular accounting to the community of compliance with reputational risk controls\n\n\nPolling Period\n\n- After 24 hours of further community consultation on the proposal, it will proceed to a Snapshot vote at 06:00 UTC on 06/11/2021 until 06:00 UTC on 09/11/2021.\n\n### **Vote**\n\nYes - approve Olympus Incubator program administered by the DAO\n\nNo - do not approve Olympus Incubator program at this time\n\n### Does the community approve Olympus Incubator program administered by the DAO?\n\nYes - Approve the program\n\nNo - Do not approve the program at this time\n\nFully in support of this. Olympus Incubator will allow us to build relationships with protocols from an early stage, and work on mutually beneficial partnerships right from the get-go. I see these partnerships adding tremendous value to the Olympus ecosystem.\n\nMany protocols are already excited about the idea of working with Olympus, who are seen as an industry innovator and emergent blue chip diamond hand org. Give the apes what they want!\n\nNice work team.\n\nOLYMPUS the godfather\n\nFull support! +EV for everyone. For projects, seed funding and the immense benefit of a fasttrack into the Olympus ecosystem (and usage by Olympus protocol itself). For Olympus, developing trust and participation in forming the products and services from an early stage will be highly valuable.\n\nDoes DAO vote before allowing each new protocol into the incubator?\n\nI love the general idea of an Olympus incubator program, but there is no mention of risks in this proposal, and the breakdown of costs to the DAO is very high level. At minimum we need an estimate of how much total it will cost the DAO to incubate each project. So far you've mentioned $250k but this doesn't account for DAO time which is a specified service we would be offering.\n\nWhat are the criteria for incubating a project? Which ohmies are deciding whether a project gets accepted or rejected? How long is an incubation period going to be? How many projects will the DAO take on at once? Who will have visibility of the work? Do we have an expected ROI and how will this be measured? Or do we have another measure of success? Or do we have a max cost we are willing to reach before we cut a project? I agree with the benefits mentioned but they are broad and fairly intangible.\n\nThe idea itself is great and I very much want to vote yes. But there is a lot of detail missing from this proposal.\n\nFully support this proposal, huge opportunity for OlympusDAO and ohm to make a difference in the industry.\n\n![🌳](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@14/assets/72x72/1f333.png)![🌳](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@14/assets/72x72/1f333.png)![🌳](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@14/assets/72x72/1f333.png)\n\nVoting in favor of this as I think one of the best ways to make OHM a reserve currency is to help launch useful platforms and protocols which treat it as one. However, before I would vote in favor at the Snapshot level I would need to know what the process would be for how the protocols are decided on. Does each potential one get its own OIP, or will there be a discord channel/forum for it, or something else entirely? A step by step explanation would be good.\n\n[kleb](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/278/7) Thanks Kleb - because each incubated project will be unique and have differing negotiated agreements I don't think putting to many strictures in place at outset is desirable.\n\nAs a DAO all the agreements will be public and I am sure receive rightful scrutiny - the DAO will track any payments and assistance provided to projects and report back to the community. Over time processes and policies for dealing with the program will be developed - but we have to have room to see what works to begin with.\n\nAs the level of assistance required and size of grants will vary from project to project so will the amount of governance token the Olympus Treasury will receive - this will all be by negotiation.\n\nWe are probably not going to get it right every time and some will think we got a good deal and others not - each agreement will be negotiated by the partnerships contributors and approved by Strategos.\n\nIf after allowing the program to run for a few months the community wishes to put certain strictures in place or decommission the program - they can of course do so by OIP vote.\n\nIn response to your specific questions:\n\n1. _So far you've mentioned $250k but this doesn't account for DAO time which is a specified service we would be offering._\n\n_Advice and assistance_ carries with it certain inferences about the amount of time required and, as it would be remunerated in comparison to the ordinary compensation, it would be minimal if the assistance is a small part of their overall roll in a given week. I imagine it would only amount to a few hours a week from several DAO members depending on the advice or assistance required - it would of course vary from time to time, maybe less at the start but more in the week before they launch.\n\n2. _What are the criteria for incubating a project?_\n\nThe criteria is maximizing the benefit to Ohmies - this will depend on the estimation of the value of return to the DAO Treasury from the project governance token received or other strategic benefits it may provide for example building on top of OHM or increased utility for OHM.\n\n3. _Which ohmies are deciding whether a project gets accepted or rejected?_\n\nThe partnerships contributors will negotiate the agreements and they will be approved or rejected by Strategos. Any one is free to join the DAO and get involved in the partnerships team.\n\n4. _How long is an incubation period going to be?_\n\nThis will vary from project to project - it may be 1 month or 6 months - it will be by negotiation and, I imagine, affect the size of the share of governance token received by Olympus.\n\n5. _How many projects will the DAO take on at once?_\n\nThis will no doubt vary from time to time - but I would say we wouldn't accept new projects if we don't think we can deliver value to them or that we can't maintain our reputation because we have taken on too many.\n\n6. _Who will have visibility of the work?_\n\nGiven the sensitive nature of new projects the current thinking is we will limit it to the person managing the incubation, Strategos & Core, and whoever is required to assist. We will be transparent with the community on the amount of assistance we are providing to projects.\n\n7. _Do we have an expected ROI and how will this be measured? Or do we have another measure of success?_\n\nThe ROI will be in the value of deposits of governance tokens to the Olympus Treasury, any fees from our products (this are likely to be low or waived given our interest in an incubated projects success) and other intangibles like utility from OHM and use of OHM as a liquidity pair or holdings in the project's Treasury. It probably won't be useful to measure until sometime after the first few projects go live and have had time to mature.\n\n8. _Or do we have a max cost we are willing to reach before we cut a project?_\n\nYes $250K or where, after a period of time, the DAO judges that the project is not likely to be viable without unreasonable further expenditure of contributors time and energies.\n\n\n\nThere is a little bit of trust required from the community for the DAO in approving the program - but the incentives are aligned for the DAO to maximize the value for the community. Being given the bandwidth to conduct the program nimbly as we get it up and running is very valuable - so we can find what works without having to regularly come back through governance which is very time consuming and diverts a lot of resources.\n\n\n[ProofofSteveGM](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/278/10)\n\nThanks Steve - the project onboarding will be negotiated by the partnerships contributors and approved by the Strategos - given incubations may be occurring quite frequently I don't think it is desirable for it to come through an OIP process or similar. Additionally, going through an OIP process or similar would likely require the disclosure of confidential information, for the community to be able to usefully reason about whether to agree to a potential project joining the program and any terms of agreement. The diversion of resources and contributors time to come through governance would be quite an additional cost to the DAO in a very competitive landscape. You, having run the gauntlet more than once, know the unseen hours it takes.\n\nThe incentives of the DAO are aligned to maximize value to Ohmies - and Strategos are best placed to reason about the value and value-add given they have most visibility to see the road ahead. Having said this of course the DAO will not always get it right and some will think we got a good deal or a bad deal depending on each agreement. The DAO members will have to wear that in the proposed process of negotiation by partnerships team and approval by Strategos.\n\nThe DAO will be transparent about the agreements, the assistance, and financial disbursements - if the community would like further oversight or strictures in place over the program - an OIP can be made at any time. I think this will be a matter taking a chance trusting that the DAO will get it right and of it building up trust with the community in relation to the program - or not getting it right and rightfully getting reigned in. I think it's worth the risk.\n\n[siainsin](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/278/6)\n\nHi siansin - the process will be for the negotiations to be done by the Partnerships team and approved by Strategos - the DAO will be transparent in the agreements, the assistance it provides and the financial cost of the program. The community have ultimate oversight of the program through the OIP process.\n\nAmazing, fully support\n\nFull support.\n\n[Mark11](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/278/12) That's all totally valid and reasonable. But I'd like to suggest that in the Snapshot vote, you include an example of how exactly the intake process works. We did this for the bug bounty OIP recently. A literal 1, 2, 3 detailing how a request is received, how it is approved, and who approves it.\n\nAs the DAO scales and grows, this is an exciting time to also support new entrants into DeFi.\n\nI am of heavy support!\n\noooh yeah - big move\n\ni really like this proposal and i think we can hold a ohmers hackthon\n\nExtremely exciting! The first steps into becoming the bank of DeFi. You love to see it.\n\nLoad More\n\nLoading...\n\nSomething went wrong while trying to load the full version of this site.

Context for this package of proposals can be found in this roadmap [A Proposals Roadmap for TEC/TEA Sustainability 12](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/a-proposals-roadmap-for-tec-tea-sustainability/1216).\n\nTo provide some context, we’ve been in contact with Gitcoin over the last month to use their new allocation protocol ( [Allo Protocol 9](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-gitcoin-grants-stack-allo-protocol-product-overviews-part-1-of-2/12664)) to set up a grants program with the goal of further increasing the dynamism of funding for token engineering projects. We’re hoping to see new projects emerge and support those who are doing a great job already.\n\nInitially, the Gitcoin team was planning some small test rounds in March, but this week they decided to scrap those plans and go straight to a set of full Partner Rounds in April. The TEC has been selected as one of just a handful of these featured partners. (Note that this means that we won’t be moving forward with the proposal for that test [posted last week 4](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/token-engineering-small-grants-pilot/1214).) This means that the deadlines for this proposal are very tight.\n\n[There’s some criteria to qualify an ‘official’ Partner Round 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IpHiqdFMuYYM7D3aNOkY_b-sYT7Xw33eOwRZqprD_GE/edit), which include having at least a $50k matching pool, however, as they’re just getting started with this new format, and because they’re still tweaking the requirements, we’ll be setting up a $25k matching pool, which is what this proposal is for.\n\n### Specifications of this round\n\nThis first round, which we’re still considering as _**the pilot**_ (just a bigger one), will look as follows:\n\n- This will be an open round, accepting any project in tooling and education that contributes to token engineering. Full details for grant acceptance are TBD (happy to hear thoughts in the comments!).\n- Tentative dates are:\n  - Criteria defined by March 28\n  - Grant applications open April 1 to 17\n  - Round starts April 25\n- Funding amount is $25k total — $23,420 coming from this proposal and $1,580 from the ENS Small Grant we won last month.\n- For the chain we’ll be choosing the one where most of rounds will happen to ensure a better experience for donors and increase donations for grantees. Chain is yet to be determined, but we’re guessing that’s going to be Optimism.\n- Payments are likely to be made in $TEC, though we’re still confirming a few details with the Gitcoin team to make sure making payments in another chain aren’t an issue.\n- Seems likely that we’ll be able to apply a _‘$TEC matching boost’_ , where those who hold $TEC can increase their matching amount, hopefully incentivising donors to buy the token and existing holders to donate. We are also investigating a similar boosting function for holders of NFT knowledge proofs from the Token Engineering Academy TE Fundamentals course.\n\nNote that some details here aren’t set in stone.\n\nWe’ll make the best decisions we can as we see how the protocol actually works, asking the community for feedback if needed.\n\n### For future rounds\n\nThe described above is very specific to the first round, where we’re trying to make the most out of the situation. Here are some things we’d like to get done in the future:\n\n- Non-reliance on TEC’s Common Pool — we want this program to be BIG and sustainable over time, will be working to find funding partners/round sponsors with the goal that little to no money from the matching pool comes from the TEC.\n- TEC Membership Boost — this is a very early concept, but the idea is to provide another benefit to TEC’s Membership (which may be composed of NFTs and $TEC, etc.).\n- $TEC donations — we want to give people the option to donate using the currency of token engineers! However due to the state of the Gnosis Chain ecosystem, most of the rounds running on Optimism/Ethereum, etc. there’s some things we still have to think about and work through. The experience for grantees and donors is very important.\n\nYou can see a full document with the different scenarios for these options [here 8](https://hackmd.io/@enti/H16-BxR1n).\n\n## Additional information to add\n\nNA\n\n## How does this proposal benefit the community and/or the field of Token Engineering?\n\n- A grants program injects dynamism into public goods funding for token engineering by helping to catalyze promising, early-stage projects.\n- A grants program enables the TEC to stretch the remaining Common Pool funds by stimulating contributions from individual donors and matching funds partners.\n- This pilot gives the TEC valuable, hands-on experience running a quadratic funding grant-making process.\n- Being one of just a few early stage Gitcoin Allo partners will boost TEC visibility and grow awareness for the field of token engineering within the broader web3 community.\n\n## Funding request\n\n$23,420.00 requested through Tao Voting (see discussion on turning off Conviction Voting [here 2](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/proposal-to-sideline-conviction-voting/1221)).\n\n## How will these funds be used? (Only for conviction voting)\n\nAll of the funds will be used as matching fund payouts to grant applicants.

Let me go through all these one by one.\n\nCurrently the smart contracts and other pieces of the Allo Protocol aren’t deployed to Gnosis Chain, though it’s on their roadmap. We could ask the Gitcoin team to get it deployed here, but here’s our reasoning not to do so right now:\n\n- The Gnosis ecosystem is still very immature, from all native projects we’d probably be the only one running rounds in here. There’s also the chance that because of TVL/active addresses, grantees may not get as much donations, you can check some numbers here:\n  - [Gnosis Chain Unique Addresses Chart \\| GnosisScan](https://gnosisscan.io/chart/address)\n  - [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/chart/address](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/chart/address)\n  - [Gnosis TVL - Llama.Fi](https://llama.fi/chain/Gnosis)\n  - [Optimism TVL - Llama.Fi](https://llama.fi/chain/Optimism)\n- We want to be Partners of the Gitcoin Rounds schedule, which would let us tap into all the exposure/marketing their rounds get. It’s a fairly bad user experience if from all the rounds on the “official” schedule, we’re the only ones on a different chain (asking people to bridge, etc.).\n\nWe know Gnosis Chain is critical to get token utility into this program, but if we get this right we could end up running one of the largest rounds, which would certainly provide value too $TEC even if it’s not used directly. This doesn’t mean that we are not thinking throughly of how to make all this work, but for now our best bet is to focus on donor/grantee experience and round growth.\n\nTLDR; We just can’t afford having such program rely financially on us, and with the immense amount of money going towards public goods funding programs it makes sense that we try to capture it.\n\nWith our common pool having just over $500k (which is used for multiple initiatives), and the $50k matching pool requirement to be a partner round, we wouldn’t be able to do this program for more than a year, or even less. Think of how Gitcoin has re-granted, iirc, more than $5M, without necessarily putting much or any at all themselves.\n\nIf we can get fundraising right, we’ll be able to secure a long term source of funding for token engineering projects! This’ll come handy as we continue to burn money trying to find that thing that will make our economy generate enough to keep advancing TE.\n\nAh sorry, that was a placeholder, the forum post talking about that hasn’t come out yet. I’ll link it as soon as it’s posted.\n\n[![](https://forum.tecommons.org/user_avatar/forum.tecommons.org/griff/45/21_2.png)](https://forum.tecommons.org/u/Griff)\n\n[Griff](https://forum.tecommons.org/u/Griff)\n\n[Mar '23](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/token-engineering-grants-program-v1-first-round-funding-proposal/1217/9 \"Post date\")\n\nVery excited for this!!

As [part of the plan](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/a-proposals-roadmap-for-tec-tea-sustainability/1216#the-proposals-road-map-3), we decided that this next cluster of proposals would be how we would test out Tao Voting for funding decisions - just to make sure we can actually make it work before turning off CV. It’s a tricky set of moves.\n\n- [Joint TEA-TEC Plan for AI-Powered Token Engineering and $TEC Utility](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/joint-tea-tec-plan-for-ai-powered-token-engineering-and-tec-utility/1231/13)\n\n[![](https://forum.tecommons.org/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/l/e480ec/45.png)](https://forum.tecommons.org/u/liviade)\n\n[liviade](https://forum.tecommons.org/u/liviade)\n\n[Mar '23](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/token-engineering-grants-program-v1-first-round-funding-proposal/1217/14 \"Post date\")\n\nthis is very much out of our governance process and it’s unfair with the bonding curve proposal too.

It’s really crucial for us to move forward with this great initiative. It will pass tomorrow because it already reached quorum, so I’ll still leave my no vote there and my comments here as a signal.

I imagine so since this is using QF, but I’m not sure how that will look on our platforms. I’m working with Amin from Giveth to integration passport on [giveth.io](http://giveth.io/) \\- happy to work together with you guys as well, I bet there’s some crossover.\n\n[![](https://forum.tecommons.org/user_avatar/forum.tecommons.org/enti/45/907_2.png)](https://forum.tecommons.org/u/enti)\n\n[enti](https://forum.tecommons.org/u/enti)\n\n[Mar '23](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/token-engineering-grants-program-v1-first-round-funding-proposal/1217/17 \"Post date\")\n\nHello [@laurenluz](https://forum.tecommons.org/u/laurenluz) thanks for the questions!\n\nAll the review process and Sybil protection is going to be done directly through Gitcoin’s platform.\n\nFor applications/review, as far as I understand, the protocol let projects make a single grant project to apply to multiple rounds. On our side we’d see those who are applying, review them and give them access if it meets our criteria.\n\n[![](https://forum.tecommons.org/user_avatar/forum.tecommons.org/laurenluz/45/202_2.png)](https://forum.tecommons.org/u/laurenluz)\n\n[laurenluz](https://forum.tecommons.org/u/laurenluz)\n\n[Mar '23](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/token-engineering-grants-program-v1-first-round-funding-proposal/1217/18 \"Post date\")\n\nRight, but afaik, passport is a pretty critical part of gitcoin’s new sybil resistance flow, so I image you would need to integrate it on the donation UI. Is that wrong? Or you’re just using their UI with you criteria for selecting projects in the round?\n\nDid you already build out comprehensive requirements for this?\n\n[![](https://forum.tecommons.org/user_avatar/forum.tecommons.org/enti/45/907_2.png)](https://forum.tecommons.org/u/enti)\n\n[enti](https://forum.tecommons.org/u/enti)\n\n[Mar '23](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/token-engineering-grants-program-v1-first-round-funding-proposal/1217/19 \"Post date\")\n\nYes, the whole round will run on Gitcoin’s platform, from contracts to UI, will look just like theirs.\n\nNot formally yet, I hope to get that done early next week.\n\n[![](https://forum.tecommons.org/user_avatar/forum.tecommons.org/laurenluz/45/202_2.png)](https://forum.tecommons.org/u/laurenluz)\n\n[laurenluz](https://forum.tecommons.org/u/laurenluz)\n\n[Mar '23](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/token-engineering-grants-program-v1-first-round-funding-proposal/1217/20 \"Post date\")\n\nCool!

Today, mostfounders are acutely aware of the value of community. In [CMX’s](https://cmxhub.com/community-industry-report-2021/) 2021 Community Industry Report, 86% of respondents (community managers from 508 different companies) said community was critical to their company’s mission, and more than two-thirds said their company planned to increase their investment in community in the next year.\n\nBut while many founders are eager to invest in community, they often don’t know what they’ll need to understand to build one the right way. Between starting and running Zyper, a platform that connected brands with super-fans, and now leading community growth strategy at Discord, I’ve built hundreds of healthy communities for businesses, brands, and creators. Before diving in and hiring a dedicated community team, I’ve learned, founders need to have a strong grasp of two essential concepts: 1) the community quadrant (to understand how community differs from other groups of people who interact with a product), and 2) the community funnel (to understand what makes a community compelling to prospective members).\n\nTo that end, I’ve put together a guide that breaks down both concepts. It doesn’t cover _everything_ _you need to know_ to build a successful community. Instead, it’s intended to teach early-stage founders just enough to begin allocating resources.\n\n### What a community is (and isn’t)\n\nOne common misconception, I’ve noticed, is the idea that “community” and “customers” are synonymous terms. They aren’t. Understanding how they differ is critical, so let’s start there.\n\nThe people who interact with your product generally fall into one of four buckets:\n\n- **Customers/users** buy and/or use your product.\n- **Evangelists** tell everyone they know to buy or use your product because they genuinely love it.\n- **Community** is the group of people who’ve found belonging and utility through your product.\n- **Ambassadors** are incentivized, through payments or rewards, to promote your product.\n\nWhat distinguishes **_community members_** from those in other groups is the congregation element: Beyond using, liking, or writing glowing reviews of your product, they spend time forming connections with other people based on a shared affinity for it.\n\n![](https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Community-Engagement-Funnel-Quad-scaled.jpg)\n\n### The quadrant, sequenced\n\nThree of these groups reliably emerge in a fixed order: Users/customers come first, followed by evangelists, and then community.\n\nAmbassadors don’t fit neatly into this sequence, so you’ll need to make a decision about their relationship to the other three groups. Even though ambassador endorsements aren’t organic, they still help spread awareness of your product to new segments and markets. Ambassadors range from nano-influencers and affiliates to well-known celebrities, and they can collectively become a community in their own right, with gamified rankings and events. Generally speaking, my advice is to build an ambassador program that functions separately from the other three groups. This article covers the [basics.](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/brand-ambassadors/)\n\nThe ideal time to launch a community varies, but you should wait until you have confirmed evangelists. People who love your product are your proof point. If self-professed evangelists haven’t announced themselves yet, email a group of your earliest customers (50 is enough) to find out if they love your product. Those who respond enthusiastically are your first evangelists; invite them to join your community. Evangelists don’t automatically become community members, but they’re the most obvious cohort to start with because you know that they like your product _and_ want to talk about it.\n\nNext, start a conversation with this founding group in a private space designed for that purpose, such as a Discord server, a Slack channel, a Telegram chat, or even a group DM on Instagram. Some community platforms are designed to be versatile while others are geared toward specific populations. [Geneva](https://geneva.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwpcOTBhCZARIsAEAYLuUHkPZHynpfN692N5vZXXnvvBNXD5TZXAVNYz-GEAu5Vz6jS2L-1AgaAs54EALw_wcB), for example, is a private group-chat app gaining traction among businesses with female customer bases.\n\nOne thing you shouldn’t do is waste engineering resources on building out your own community infrastructure. At this stage, third-party community platforms will meet all your technical needs. Plus, your target community members might already use them. Meeting people where they are never hurts.\n\nThe early days of community-building should feel like user research. You’re _not_ trying to build an audience or sustain engagement.Instead, you’re experimenting with different offerings to figure out what your evangelists want. Audio? AMAs? IRL meet-ups? Ask them directly. Not only will you learn what they find valuable, you’ll also give them a sense of belonging.\n\nThe specific offerings that appeal to evangelists vary by community. For example, members of [_Scream Movies_](https://discord.com/invite/screammovies) on Discord — a community for super-fans of the franchise — get exclusive access to events like director AMAs. That’s a big deal if you’re a Ghostface diehard.\n\n![](https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Community-Engagement-Funnel-screammovieama-scaled.jpg)\n\nBut AMAs might not be such an effective way to generate interest in every community. Take the [SBUX Hub](https://discord.com/invite/starbucks) on Discord, an unofficial Starbucks community for baristas and fans alike. Perks of membership include behind-the-counter secrets and access to off-menu recipes. Here, learning about seasonal Frappuccino flavors months before they’re announced might drum up more excitement than, say, joining an AMA with Howard Schultz.\n\n![](https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Community-Engagement-Funnel-Starbuckscustomersandemployees-scaled.jpg)\n\nOnce you have a handle on the quadrant, the second concept to master is the community funnel.\n\n### The community funnel: invited —> invested\n\nCommunities are primarily valuable to businesses for two reasons:\n\n- They create a built-in source of real-time user feedback, which is critical for building a product people really want.\n- They foster friendships rooted in an affinity for your product, which drives lifetime value and new customer referrals.\n\n![](https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Community-Engagement-Funnel-Venn-Diagram-scaled.jpg)\n\nWhen it comes to community-building, it’s your job to spark the fire. But you can’t keep it burning alone. The key to a thriving community is members who careenough to take initiative — they pose thoughtful questions to the group,introduce new topics to explore, and sometimes evenplan events, online or off, to help people bond. And they’re invested enough in the community to assume some of the responsibility of steering it forward. Early on, think about identifying folks you’d like to see take on more responsibility.\n\nBut new community members don’t magically turn into devotees. You need to set the stage for that to happen — both by letting early members play a role in shaping and growing the community, and also by creating an environment compelling enough to reel in anyone who enters. The community funnel charts a prospective member’s path from receiving an invitation to becoming an invested, active member. It’s important to think about your role in moving members through the funnel.\n\nOne priority should be optimizing introductions: A member’s first few interactions with the community can have an outsized influence on whether or not they stick around. Consider those early experiences through the eyes of a new member:\n\n**Is the initial invitation compelling?** Does it spark excitement or curiosity, or make prospective members feel special? On [Geneva](https://geneva.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwpcOTBhCZARIsAEAYLuWyy-2AtlZhXleWWypV8P9irIeibq72O8ZESLP3k3M6_b2QME7dTk4aAjXrEALw_wcB), invites are often hard to find, which makes them fun to discover. This also gives new members something to bond over right away.\n\n![](https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Community-Engagement-Funnel-genevacommunitywelcome-scaled.jpg)\n\n**Do members land in space that’s easy to understand and navigate, and also fun to spend time in**? Simply numbering channels and visually laying out the first steps a new member should take is a low-lift way to guide people through the on-boarding experience. Extra points if the space is beautifully designed. User-friendly design makes the Discord server for [crypto collective Orange DAO](https://discord.com/invite/DVncb7UxGB) inviting to first-timers:\n\n![](https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Community-Engagement-Funnel-ycorangedao-scaled.jpg)\n\nThe ultra-simple layout of Telegram channels, which only have one central chat, makes the platform a low-friction way to get a community going. Here’s what new members see upon joining [Poolsuite’s chat](https://t.me/poolsuite):\n\n![](https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Community-Engagement-Funnel-poolsuitetelegram-scaled.jpg)\n\n**Are members individually welcomed into the space by a human (rather than a bot) and introduced into the conversation?** [Stripe’s developer community on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/stripe) exemplifies digital hospitality with an active developer relations team welcoming new members:\n\n![](https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Community-Engagement-Funnel-stripedevcommunitydiscord-scaled.jpg)\n\n**Once introduced, do community members feel compelled to participate in the conversation?** Participation primes members to become friends, which makes them feel more deeply tied to the community and motivated to contribute to it regularly. Most people who join your community will be evangelists for your _product_. By the time they reach the end of the funnel, they’ll (also) be evangelists for your _community_.\n\n![](https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Community-Engagement-Funnel-Funnel-scaled.jpg)\n\nNow that you understand these two foundational community-building concepts, it’s time to begin architecting your community strategy. Start by clearly articulating why you’re building the community and what the value exchange will be. In other words, what will community members gain from joining and participating, and how does it help your business (now and down the road) to devote resources to community that could go elsewhere?\n\nThe value of community isn’t always easy to quantify financially, but there are benefits beyond the bottom line. If you get the basics down and approach community-building thoughtfully, your company will become a catalyst for strong relationships that grow alongside it.\n\nPosted May 3, 2022\n\n- [![](https://future.com/wp-content/themes/future/assets/images/no-image-default.jpg)](https://future.com/author/amber-atherton/)\n\n\n\n[**Amber Atherton** is a British entrepreneur and angel investor based in Silicon Valley.

Collectively, their work has become known as the decentralized science movement, or DeSci.\n\n## What is decentralized science (DeSci)?\n\nStill in its infancy, decentralized science (DeSci) lies at the intersection of two broader trends: 1) efforts within the scientific community to change how research is funded and knowledge is shared, and 2) efforts within the crypto-focused movement to shift ownership and value away from industry intermediaries. But what exactly does DeSci entail?\n\nI’m a neuroscientist and cofounder of a [startup](https://www.phas3.io/lynx) that uses the blockchain to provide users of wearables with full ownership and control over their biometric data (including brain data). I recently published a short [letter](https://lnkd.in/d3zAYCHA) in the journal _Nature_ encouraging scientists across all disciplines to join DeSci. As the movement grows, so does the need for open public discussion. To that end, I’ve put together an introductory guide that covers how DeSci came to be, what its defining features are, what the major debates and open questions are within the movement, and where the greatest opportunities and challenges lie.\n\n## DeSci drivers\n\nThe DeSci movement aims to enhance scientific funding; unleash knowledge from silos; eliminate reliance on profit-hungry intermediaries such as publisher conglomerates; and increase collaboration across the field.\n\n[Funding](https://future.com/what-we-learned-doing-fast-grants/) is an especially acute pain point for scientists, who spend up to [half](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12016710/science-challeges-research-funding-peer-review-process#1) their time writing grant proposals. Success in getting funding is heavily tied to metrics such as the [h-index](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8238192/), which quantifies the impact of a scientist’s published work.The resulting pressure to “publish or perish” incentivizes the pursuit of novel research over work that’s critical but less likely to grab headlines. Ultimately, inadequate and unreliablefunding not only reduces the amount of science being done, but also biases which projects scientists choose, contributing to issues such as the [replication crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis).\n\nInformation access is another much-lamented problem. Despite the fact that science is the epitome of a global [public good](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK221876/#:~:text=Scientific%20knowledge%20in%20its%20pure,basic%20component%20of%20our%20economy.), a lot of scientific knowledge is trapped behind journal paywalls and inside private databases. Making all types of data more accessible is the main objective of the [Open Science](https://osf.io/) movement, which emerged over a decade ago.\n\nOpen Science initiatives have had far-reaching effects, including [mandates](https://publicaccess.nih.gov/) by the National Institutes of Health and other funding sources to publish open-access findings. But the extent to which science has improved as a result is a matter of debate. For example, journals responded to these mandates with pay-to-publish business models. Now, instead of paying to read other people’s studies, publicly funded scientists pay to publish their own research. ( _Nature_ charges over $11,000 per paper.) Some academics have argued that open access mandates increasingly [concentrate power](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/06/04/the-gold-rush-why-open-access-will-boost-publisher-profits/) in the hands of major publishers.\n\n## Where DeSci comes in\n\nThough aligned with Open Science on the need to make science more accessible, DeSci isn’t Open Science 2.0. It’s a separate movement with varied and evolving goals. What primarily differentiates DeSci from other efforts to rethink our research system is its use of blockchain tools. This is similar to how blockchain is [disrupting other industries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=pSTNhBlfV_s), where web2 models of centralized ownership are being challenged by web3 models of decentralized, shared ownership.,/p>\n\nScience-focused blockchain initiatives date back to 2015, but they didn’t coalesce into a larger movement until 2021, thanks to an explosion of new projects. This included the first Open Science NFT selling for [13 ETH](https://twitter.com/stephensonhmatt/status/1377316537950932992); the subsequent rise of research groups auctioning [NFTs](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01642-3); the growth of multiple science-focused decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs); and a DeSci [panel discussion](https://vimeo.com/639601420?1&ref=fb-share&fbclid=IwAR3v71BsI4wUYMlPSxPpOINdulaZjXoUeVFoxdOq_c6EeyjpNozB6trPO64) at last October’s community-led blockchain event, [LisCon](https://liscon.org/).\n\nThe resulting DeSci landscape is a mix of loosely connected DAOs. Some target specific aspects of scientific research, such as [funding](https://sciencefund.io/), [peer review,](about:blank) [access](https://www.oadao.org/), [incentives](http://atoms.org/), and [pace](https://www.researchhub.com/). Others focus on specific fields. Biotech is in the lead, with DAOs including [Molecule](https://www.molecule.to/), [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/), [PsyDAO](https://www.psydao.io/), [Phage Directory,](https://phage.directory/) [LabDAO](https://www.labdao.com/) and [SCINET](https://www.sci-net.io/). [Environmental science DAOs are gaining steam too](https://dynamiculture.io/home). Beyond DAOs, individual [scientists](https://csferrie.medium.com/following-digital-butterflies-9dc12dfeb44a) are experimenting with blockchain by launching their own research [tokens](https://mirror.xyz/0xa84C69597C5aF912523a76A66d55f76a3f2FFc84/crowdfunds/0x015ACf97291dc873a81985deBACD9E215AC50C5c).\n\nAcross the board, DeSci efforts range from purely theoretical ideas and small-scale technological experiments to more established players [funding university research](https://medium.com/molecule-blog/ip-nfts-for-researchers-a-new-biomedical-funding-paradigm-91312d8d92e6) and launching [multiple DAOs](https://medium.com/molecule-blog/the-emergence-of-biotech-daos-407e31748cd4) of their own.\n\n## How DeSci actually uses blockchain tools\n\n**Smart contracts:** Whilescientists perform peer review for free, the academic publishing industry extracts [enormous profits](https://tidsskriftet.no/en/2020/08/kronikk/money-behind-academic-publishing#:~:text=As%20an%20industry,%20these%20publishing,upwards%20(4%E2%80%936).) from the process by acting as an intermediary. [Ants Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09378) has shown how smart contracts could instead mediate directly between authors and peer reviewers, who would be rewarded with tokens for their review.\n\n**Incentivized communities:** Tokens/NFTs could be used to incentivize scientific communities to share, review, and curate different types of information into resources, such as “ [smart manuscripts](https://twitter.com/jocelynnpearl/status/1490388486611877889?s=21)” (which link open-source data and protocols) and article collections. This could enable new models of knowledge-sharing and rapid publishing and review, similar to a cultivated and managed version of [#AcademicTwitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/academictwitter/). Such communities could especially enhance the quality and usability of [preprints](https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-021-00667-7) (manuscripts published before peer review). Preprints are vital for rapid science, as shown by scientists’ reliance on them during the COVID pandemic.\n\n**Combat censorship**: [Claims](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-you-know-about-trumps-assault-on-science-was-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg/) of political interference in science have been made against multiple US administrations. The “ [permaweb](https://www.arweave.org/)” properties of blockchain — where users can store data and information forever, accessible from any location at any time — can be leveraged to guard against scientific censorship.\n\n**Blockchain-based funding models:** As mentioned above, scientists and DAOs are currently experimenting with NFT and token launches to fund research. Future possibilities also include:\n\n- Adapting blockchain-based public good funding models, such as [Quadratic Funding](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-quadratic-funding-for-the-world/) and [retroactive funding](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c), by setting up [platforms and protocols](https://medium.com/@jillcarlson/products-platforms-and-protocols-bbef1c726561) dedicated to science.\n- Adapting emerging DeFi (decentralized finance) [protocols](https://www.angelprotocol.io/) to create sustainable long-term funding for scientists, which might resemble traditional tenure.\n- Returning value from commercializable outputs (e.g., drug [IP NFTs](https://opensea.io/assets/0x42d2354ef0b54279516f5799791086f2f499086e/77379318712039290824426798626037872787628160616774329410851863732077774590161)) to fund further research, enabling self-sustaining scientific communities.\n\n**Verifiable reputation**: Currently, scientists’ reputations — and as a result their ability to secure funding — are tied to [publishing metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index). With blockchain technology, scientists could earn [NFTs](https://poap.xyz/) for doing other activities that research communities deem valuable, such as peer review, training and mentoring, and sharing data openly. NFT collections could act as a verifiable digital reputation for contributions, further incentivizing such behaviors. Scientists and groups of individuals with a shared wallet, such as a decentralized lab, could build reputation this way.\n\nAs academic institutions increasingly shift their learning online, DeSci ecosystems may form an attractive alternative to traditional scientific education. Students will be able to simultaneously learn and build their digital reputations by taking part in community tasks, including those traditionally performed during a dissertation, like literature reviews, data cleaning, and analysis. This would allow people to be rewarded for contributing to science while they learn. The ability for anyone with an internet connection to contribute to the public good of science would help counteract the [elitism](https://kinesismagazine.com/2021/04/12/opinion-elitism-in-stem-is-detrimental-to-both-diversity-and-science-itself/) that has historically plagued the field.\n\n**Ownership:** Open Science has been criticized for the potential [risk](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0306312718772086) of sleepwalking toward one large commercial platform eventually _owning_ science. In a DeSci ecosystem, different aspects of science, such as peer review and reputation systems, could be governed by separate, specialized communities. This would both mitigate against the risk of single platform domination and also help future-proof science against rapidly changing technologies and emerging threats.\n\nDeSci additionally enables communities to be the new “shareholders” of scientific knowledge (e.g., through [IP-NFTs](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d) that can be [owned by DAOs](https://mobile.twitter.com/paulkhls/status/1427725979359789064)). Value generated by such assets can then be used to fund the creation of new knowledge, in an attempt to build self-sustaining scientific ecosystems. Consider [COVID vaccines](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/pfizer-biontech-and-moderna-making-1000-profit-every-second-while-world-s-poorest), developed using technology that stands on the shoulders of decades of publicly funded research. The ability for vaccine prices to be set by communities that are open to all, and for profits to flow back into funding additional community-owned science, could significantly impact the health and prosperity of the world.\n\n## Debates and open questions\n\nAs the movement takes shape, so do a number of broad unknowns and debates.\n\n**Is “DeSci” the right name?** While decentralization is an important feature of DeSci, not everyone feels it’s _the_ defining feature. Some also take issue with “Sci” being in the name, claiming that it excludes other forms of scholarly pursuit, including arts, humanities, and [indigenous systems of knowledge](https://en.unesco.org/links).\n\n**What is the movement united around?** DeSci lacks a clear set of shared values. Currently, different segments are defined by the problems they’re attempting to solve. For a new culture within science to emerge, the movement would benefit from rallying behind common principles.\n\n**Whose interests will DeSci ultimately serve**? Modern science serves a mix of industries, including academic publishing, higher education, and biopharma. Evaluation is needed to understand who and what the public good of science should ultimately serve, and how blockchain technologies could help achieve this.\n\n**How will DeSci protect science against biases arising from blockchain commercialization**? DeSci communities may vote to fund commercializable research (e.g., projects that yield IP) over fundamental basic research (e.g., understanding the expression of a specific gene). To help mitigate against this bias, DAOs could use profits from commercial research to fund basic research.Also, scientists who focus on basic research could leverage blockchain technology to [track](https://oceanprotocol.com/) subsequent use of any data generated, enabling them to receive royalties for producing the foundational work upon which downstream commercial research is built.\n\nIt remains to be seen how DAOs will collaborate to address these unknowns, and the obvious question emerges: How decentralized should the movement be? To what extent should DeSci projects tackle these questions as a unified movement or build independently?\n\n## Challenges to navigate\n\n**Scientific quality:** Issues have been [raised](https://medium.com/@AdrianoStencel/science-and-web3-do-non-fungible-tokens-nfts-provide-a-way-to-democratise-and-increase-b57b5caa246b) about whether non-scientists are capable of distinguishing high-quality projects from bad ones. Robust reputation and governance systems are therefore vital. For example, verified scientists could pre-screen grant applications for the wider community to vote on. Bridges between DeSci and traditional science could also help with quality assessment. For example, traditional funders, such as medical charities, could “ [bless](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html)” high-quality projects that they’re not able to support themselves.\n\nDAOs would also benefit from designing such governance systems with edge cases in mind. For example, what if the community is infiltrated by a vast number of Flat Earthers, who work to divert treasury funds toward this research?\n\n**Diverse participation:** DeSci communities will be largely made up of people who are already involved in both crypto and science, two spaces where women are underrepresented. Gender imbalances (among other kinds) have real consequences — women’s health, for example, has been historically [under-researched](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/dec/18/women-have-been-woefully-neglected-does-medical-science-have-a-gender-problem). It’s important for groups who make decisions about science to be representative of society.\n\n**Building DeSci protocols**: Efforts to decentralize science have been around for years. New projects should work to understand the strengths and weaknesses of previous projects, and generally build with history in mind. The movement would also benefit from experimenting with different blockchain technologies, particularly those with low fees and minimal environmental impact.\n\n**Prioritizing end goals**: Ultimately, DeSci is a movement that’s experimenting with a collection of new tools in an attempt to improve science. For DeSci to succeed, these tools should be unnoticeable and integrate seamlessly into the everyday work of scientists. DeSci should therefore focus on empowering scientists to do good science, and ensure through robust user research that the focus is on this and not on these new tools themselves.\n\n## How to get up to speed\n\nWhether you want to keep up with major DeSci news or join a DAO, here’s a list of resources to help you get acquainted with the movement.\n\n**The DeSci** [**Wiki**](https://valley-hornet-d46.notion.site/Science-x-Blockchain-Notes-83c5d2125afe435487a012627819c75a?s=09) **:** [Dr. Jocelynn Pearl](https://www.jocelynnpearl.com/) is taking the lead on building this community resource for people to learn about existing projects and how to get involved in them.\n\n**Twitter**: The small but growing DeSci movement is vocal on Twitter, where community members make announcements about their projects and debate key topics. For starters, follow #DeSci and these key influencers:\n\n- [Bianca Trovò](https://twitter.com/bianca_troveaux), founder of Ants Review\n- [Paul Kohlhaas](https://twitter.com/paulkhls), cofounder of Molecule\n- [Tyler Golato](https://twitter.com/golatotyler), cofounder of Molecule, core at VitaDAO and PsyDAO\n- [Jocelynn Pearl](https://twitter.com/jocelynnpearl), host and producer of Lady Scientist Podcast, cofounder of LabDAO and launch team for OpenAccessDAO\n- [Nate Jacobs](https://mobile.twitter.com/natesjacobs), a Science Fund Founder and flashpub.io founder/CEO\n- [Ariella Coler-Reilly](https://twitter.com/AriellaStudies), managing editor of VitaDAO\n\n**Beyond Twitter**: Telegram and Discord are two other digital spaces where you can find DeSci conversations to take part in and active members of the movement to connect with.\n\n- On Telegram, check out [Blockchain of Science](https://t.me/BlockchainForScience) and [Women in Web3 x Science](https://t.me/+Y6OzEBEnSaVkMTM8).\n- On Discord: [DeSciWorld](https://discord.com/invite/jnEUqVH8xv) and [Opscientia](https://discord.gg/Rb4vKg9w).",

But I'm here to explore philanthropy/social impact/charity at the intersection of web3._\n\n_It’s so exciting to have found a tribe that’s taking moonshots and making waves. 8x startup founder who now works exclusively in DAOs. Over at Krause House DAO, I’m leading a proposal for us to earn a stake in the NBA’s New Orleans Pelicans by delivering acts of goodwill from the community._\n\n_My mission is to help completely remove all the secret unexploded bombs that cover 2/3rds of the land mass of Laos. We are doing this by contributing 50% of initial sales from NFTs to the Legacies of War foundation who are working relentlessly in helping._\n\n**Web3 has the promise to improve people’s lives in ways that we are just beginning to uncover.** These quotes are from people who are at the edges of creating this new future and just a sampling of the type of people you'll meet if you join the Future Foundation discord server.\n\nBy the way, you should absolutely [join us](https://discord.gg/D4pN7YNY6Q), but more on that in just a bit.\n\n* * *\n\nJust a few weeks ago, we launched [Future Foundation](https://discord.gg/D4pN7YNY6Q) as a bit of an experiment. We had a hunch that web3 had so much promise in creating a more just and joyful future, but it wasn't going to happen by accident. It was going to happen because we came together as a community to design it.\n\nIn the spirit of building out loud, we hung out our shingle and crossed our fingers. Would anyone show up? Would we find common ground to work together? Would people be stoked to help each other and build up the broader web3 x social impact space?\n\nYes, yes, and hell yeah.\n\nOver the past few weeks, we’ve welcomed over 270 people who are all interested in the web3 x social impact space, and we’re just getting started.\n\nFollowing the wisdom that networks move at the speed of trust, we’ve been using this time to get to know each other, learn more about each other’s work and interest in the web3 x social impact space, and begin a practice of actively seeking and receiving help.\n\nWe’ve also used this time to unpack the intersection of web3 and social impact and discuss what Future Foundation and this nascent space could and should look like. This is what we learned.\n\n## What We're Seeing\n\n**There is so much optimism for the future of web3 and social impact.**\n\nWe are all here because we have this intuitive sense that things can be different, that we can design systems that are more just and joyful for everyone. We’re inspired by the Cambrian explosion of innovation that has been happening in the web3 space, and we’re excited to support and accelerate the pace of innovation in the web3 x social impact space, build out loud, and root for future forks and iterations on this model.\n\n**We’re excited about the potential of local, place-based programs as well as opportunities for global, systemic change.** We are not afraid to dream big and question the underlying assumptions of the systems around us, and we are inspired by how people are responding to challenges at all scales through web3.\n\nWhether it is addressing [climate](https://climatecollective.org/) [change](https://www.klimadao.finance/), creating new income opportunities through [play-to-earn models](https://axieinfinity.com/), experimenting with [UBI programs](https://www.impactmarket.com/), or [incentivizing acts of service](https://leyline.gg/) in a community, we are excited to support the growing web3 x social impact space.\n\n**If we don’t intentionally design it, we’ll recreate the systems and structures that have failed so many in the past.** It can be easy to get swept up in the excitement of this space, but we know that web3 isn’t a panacea. We know that [most of the world won’t be able to enjoy the promise of web3](https://www.fwb.help/wip/building-an-inclusive-world-of-crypto) unless critical barriers - whether they are of access, affordability, digital confidence, relevance, etc. - are addressed and overcome.\n\nThere is growing recognition that even when people do have the ability and means to use web3, there are issues of bias and exclusion. We’re encouraged by projects like [Komorebi Fund](https://syndicate.io/syndicate/komorebi_collective), an investment DAO focused on funding female and nonbinary crypto founders, and [Audacity Fund](https://syndicate.io/syndicate/audacity), a crypto fund focused on Black and African founders, and we know that there is much more work that needs to be done in this space.\n\n## Our Core Beliefs\n\nWe started Future Foundation based on a core set of beliefs, and they have only been reaffirmed through these early weeks with our growing community.\n\n- We believe that we can create a more just and joyful world through design, technology, and community.\n- We believe that [progress is possible, but not inevitable](https://ourworldindata.org/problems-and-progress).\n- We believe that new technologies and behaviors emerging from web3 create new possibilities for creativity, coordination, and ownership.\n- We believe that we need action at both local and global levels if we are to redesign our systems so that they benefit everyone.\n- We believe that without a clear intention, the world's most vulnerable populations will be the last to benefit from the promise of web3 and the broader digital economy.\n\n## So, what are we going to do?\n\nFuture Foundation’s mission is to support web3 x social impact organizations and the broader web3 x social impact ecosystem.\n\nBased on feedback from the community, we're starting with three program areas.\n\n**Reimagine social impact funding** We’ve experienced first-hand the art and science of grant-making, and we are excited to experiment with different web3-enabled mechanisms of raising and distributing funds.\n\nWe are excited to explore the range of possibilities for raising funds for social impact causes and organizations. We’ve seen [scholarships in the play-to-earn space](https://twitter.com/yieldguild/status/1389089510781112320), NFT projects donating funds to charities, and [charity-focused](https://doingud.com/) [NFT platforms](https://impactapp.xyz/) emerge. But what’s beyond the horizon?\n\nIn turn, we’re excited to experiment with different forms of decentralized decision-making processes. [Vitalik argues that we need to move away from coin voting](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) as the only legitimate form of decentralized governance, and we agree. This space is ripe for innovation – especially in creating decision-making processes that are more equitable, effective, efficient, and emphasizes lived experience – and we’re excited to build out loud and try out different mechanisms with the community.\n\n_Imagine if… web3 blurred the lines between donor and recipient and created a community that owned their path to a better tomorrow._\n\n**Support web3 x social impact causes and organizations** But of course, the funds don't matter without the projects and organizations. We're excited by the huge growth in web3 x social impact organizations, and we want to figure out how we can best help them grow - whether it is through capital, capacity building, access to specific expertise, or something else - and achieve their respective missions.\n\nTo do that, we’re looking to support web3-native and web3-curious social impact organizations by bringing together leaders from the web3 and social impact spaces.\n\nWe’re inspired by models like [Kernel](http://kernel.community/en/) and [Seed Club](https://seedclub.xyz/), and we can’t wait to meet and support the next generation of web3 x social impact leaders and communities.\n\n_Imagine if… web3 x social impact organizations could tap into the treasuries and talent networks of the leading web3 projects today._\n\n**Build, Connect, and Amplify the web3 x social impact ecosystem** We’ve already seen people and projects connect with each other on the Future Foundation discord server, and we know that this is just the beginning. Partnerships have been formed, nonprofits have been brought onto donation platforms, and working groups are forming to explore big topics like defi in emerging markets and web3 x climate.\n\nWe know that there is value in getting smarter, celebrating wins, learning from failures, and rooting for each other as a network, and we’ll continue to create [assets](https://futurefoundation.notion.site/Web3-x-Social-Impact-Examples-Curated-by-Future-Foundation-c47723dc60664d11b02e2cc69c91446e) and spaces that benefit the broader web3 x social impact community.\n\n_Imagine if... we could build the lego blocks of web3 x social impact projects that future projects can use to build upon our work and create new possibilities._\n\n## How to get involved\n\nWe are excited to finally introduce Future Foundation to everyone, and we can’t wait to come together and work towards creating a more just and joyful world.\n\nWe are going to transition this community into a DAO in the near future! Here are some ways to get involved today.\n\n**Hop into the Discord**: If you’re interested in exploring the web3 x social impact space and meeting some of the leaders in this space, [come join us](https://discord.gg/D4pN7YNY6Q). We can’t wait to meet you and build with you.\n\n**Join the Roster**: Are you down to collaborate with web3 x social impact organizations? If so, there are a bunch of web3 x social impact organizations that would love your help. We’re looking for people with backgrounds in web3 (e.g., designer, developer, tokenomics, community manager) and the social impact space (e.g., nonprofit leader, climate change, financial health, youth leadership, legal, policy, advocacy). [Join the roster](https://airtable.com/shrnwegBhBFQyy7qQ) and let us know how you can best help.\n\n**Say Hello**: Are you a web3-native or web3-curious social impact organization that would like support in leveraging web3 to amplify your mission? [Let us know.](https://airtable.com/shrqluhngkoiRjgHS) We’d love to work with you.\n\n**Fund us**: You can begin funding the Future Foundation treasury by collecting this post as an NFT. The funds will be used to fund core DAO operations and help us compensate contributors who are all working on creating a more just and joyful world. You can also [make a donation to Future Foundation’s Community Fund](https://app.endaoment.org/funds/cc4c5da6-4b8d-4901-b711-60d35508bf4b). These funds will be managed by Future Foundation and directed towards 501(c)(3) organizations in the United States.\n\n* * *\n\n_Big thank you to Lina ( [@doodlesafstrom](https://twitter.com/doodlesafstrom)) for creating the beautiful cover image._\n\nSubscribe to Future Foundation\n\nReceive the latest updates directly to your inbox.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe\n\nVerification\n\nThis entry has been permanently stored onchain and signed by its creator.\n\n[Arweave Transaction\\\\\n\\\\\nLqku7nk1SeybItx…1gASk9vVY3BHrg0](https://viewblock.io/arweave/tx/Lqku7nk1SeybItxIHEOXeaDegSbt1gASk9vVY3BHrg0) [Author Address\\\\\n\\\\\n0x0B7a1e683bB5C88…2288a10CDA30A95](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0B7a1e683bB5C882722Ef2F332288a10CDA30A95)\n\nContent Digest\n\nNyVYBL\\_a2zPsLSa…2ITA\\_b9z0Ha0gqE\n\nMore from Future Foundation\n\n[View All](https://future.mirror.xyz/)",

Civic leaders and municipalities can commit to investing in and supporting opportunities directed at:\n\n- The restoration of land rights\n- The strengthening of cultural identities and capacity-building\n- Building robust communities that are self-determined by Indigenous peoples.\n\n#### [Download the toolkit](https://evergreen.ca/resource-hub/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/fcc-civic-indigenous-toolkit-final-2022.pdf)\n\n**Intended Audience**\n\nThe Toolkit is intended for all those who are interested in Indigenous worldviews and truth and reconciliation. It will be especially useful for community leaders, practitioners’and staff from municipalities, civic and cultural organizations working in the spaces of placekeeping, city building and reconciliation and who want to strengthen their relationships with Indigenous partners. Although the focus is on urban placekeeping and civic-Indigenous engagement, the Toolkit can also be used by organizations in other sectors interested in Indigenous engagement, Indigenous community, and organizations outside of urban centres, and provincial and territorial associations and organizations.\n\n#### 1. [About the Toolkit](https://evergreen.ca/resource-hub/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/fcc-civic-indigenous-acknowledgement-intro.pdf)\n\n#### 2\\.

Summary\n\nAccording to leading experts and the CEOs of AI corporations, capability advancements over next five years will see the creation of incredibly powerful systems—systems that outpace humans at virtually every task. It is almost certain that these will completely transform our society, our economy, and our very lives, for better or worse. Polls repeatedly reveal that industry, different communities, civil society, and the general public are rightly alarmed at the scale and speed of this transformation, and are anxious to make sure that corporations are developing and deploying controllable and reliable AI systems that are designed to address specific problems and improve lives everywhere.\n\nTo date, the conversation around AI and policy has not had sufficient input from all the segments of society set to be impacted. If we are to create a future where AI serves everyone, not just a select few, discourse and decision-making urgently needs participation from those affected, and we must do more to bring them to the table intentionally, and make their voices heard. To help address this, the Future of Life Institute is launching a new grants program of up to $5 million to support projects that work to meaningfully engage, educate, and activate key stakeholder groups, as well as the general public, to help realize secure and prosperous futures with AI.\n\nWe are looking for to make grants that focus on **either:**\n\n- Working to educate and engage different **specific stakeholder groups,** bringing them to the table in the fight for positive AI futures.\n- Public outreach and organization on AI issues at a **grassroots level,** helping them to make their voices heard.\n\nFor proposals in either of these “streams”, we are looking for grants that seek to grow and deepen the movement to deliver positive futures with AI. These are futures where advanced AI systems benefit everyone as tools, rather than as unpredictable and uncontrollable systems. For more information, and to assess alignment, see [Our Position on AI](https://futureoflife.org/our-position-on-ai/).\n\n[Apply here](https://www.grantinterface.com/Form/Preview?form=1444187&urlkey=fli).\n\n## II. FLI on Movement Building\n\nThe future of AI has profound consequences for everyone on earth, and its different communities should have a say in its continued development—especially when the stakes are so high. While recent years have seen incredible progress in driving awareness of the staggering implications of the technology for our economies, our societies, and our continued existence, the debate around advanced AI has remained something of a closed shop, limited to handful of tech executives, policymakers and think tanks.. While the enormous impacts on different stakeholder groups are acknowledged, little has been done to work with them individually, share relevant information on technological advancements, surface group-specific concerns, and provide them will opportunities for regional, national and international engagement. This massively harms the quality of discourse, hinders meaningful transparency and understanding of the technology and its effects, renders the AI discourse increasingly elitist and opaque, and hamstrings the creation of a safe, secure, and prosperous future with AI.\n\nThis can also cause lawmakers and other decision-makers to underestimate AI concerns within their constituencies, deterring them from taking the urgent action necessary to keep pace with AI’s dizzying rate of development. While many of them intellectually understand the many risks presented by an out-of-control race to develop increasingly powerful general-purpose AI, they are not convinced of widespread concern, and do not feel sufficient pressure to take action—especially in the face of enormous Big Tech influence and lobbying. Similarly, while there is substantial evidence of widespread concern within the general public around AI’s rapid advancement and increasing integration into their daily lives, a lack of grassroots education, engagement and organization causes this concern to be underestimated and underappreciated by lawmakers and other decision-makers.\n\nThe engagement and activation of key stakeholder groups, and the grassroots education and organization of the general public, would be instrumental in changing this.\n\n### Guidelines:\n\n- We would like to see proposals that seek to engage and organize support for AI safety at a grassroots level, surfacing growing concerns and creating high-impact opportunities/platforms for mobilization.\n- We have a strong preference for proposals that incorporate professional organizers, with the experience and expertise necessary to apply strategy/learnings from other successful grassroots campaigns.\n- We would like to see proposals that seek to educate, engage and collaborate with specific stakeholder groups in efforts to deliver safe and beneficial AI. These groups could be demographic, professional, socioeconomic, religious, etc.\n- Proposals should be evidence-based, drawing on learnings from other movement-building efforts to demonstrate grounds for success.\n- Proposals should explain their approach, engagement and activation strategy, and _why_ they are appropriate for the group in question. We have a strong preference for working with individuals/organizations who have considerable experience working with or for said groups.\n- We will actively prioritize bipartisanship and inclusivity in our grant-making process, making sure to consider proposals that work to engage people, groups and organizations from across the political spectrum.\n- Proposals with clear timelines and measurable metrics for success.\n\n## III. Possible Projects\n\nProjects will fit this call if they are broadly consistent with the vision and scope put forth above. Examples of potential projects include:\n\n- Proposals from within key stakeholder groups (e.g. associations, unions) that aim to educate members, explore and identify group-specific concerns/impacts, and encourage action from leadership.\n- Projects which seek to work with specific political groups on AI issues, exploring ongoing and forecasted developments within the context of different positions, priorities and worldviews, as well as subsequent activation.\n- Experienced organizers applying lessons from other successful campaigns to surface widespread anxieties about advancing AI, coordinate and grow public engagement/activism, and catalyze a movement that is impossible to ignore.\n- Evidence-based efforts to deliver large-scale protests around imminent AI threats and lawmaker inaction, with clear plans, timelines, and reasons to believe the project will be successful.\n- Projects which look to support and supercharge the growth of existing, nascent AI safety movements within specific groups or constituencies.\n- Organizations or associations representing specific stakeholder groups (e.g. religious groups) who want to educate and engage their members on issues related to AI safety.\n- New platforms or communications channels which seek to facilitate and coordinate safety engagement from the general public or specific constituencies, e.g. webinars, event series.\n- Public education and awareness campaigns which look to spotlight stakeholder-specific AI issues, meet groups “where they are”, and drive AI safety engagement.\n- Local mobilization efforts, which look to amplify geographically-specific AI anxieties and coordinate concerned individuals into highly-visible movements.\n- Highly-targeted and compelling social media campaigns or online protest movements which look to engage influencers and millions of users in the fight for safe and secure AI.\n- The development of digital tools that can help to educate and engage specific stakeholder groups or the general public on AI safety.\n\nExamples of projects which are unlikely to receive funding:\n\n- Projects which are not sufficiently specific in their movement-building approach or tactic e.g. Why that group? Why that particular organization strategy or form of grassroots activism? Proposals for “general support” of existing organizations are unlikely to succeed.\n- Projects which do not include sufficient expertise or experience in the proposed means of engagement, organization, or activation.\n- Projects which are not grounded in evidence and do not present compelling and robust explanations for why they will succeed.\n- Proposals which lack timelines for success and tangible objectives.\n- Projects which are dismissive of the enormous implications and risks presented by increasingly powerful and uncontrollable AI system.\n- While we are eager to consider projects that seek to engage identifiable political constituencies, we are unlikely to support projects which are overly partisan in nature.\n\n## IV. Evaluation Criteria & Project Eligibility\n\nIndividual grants between $100k-500k, up to $5m in total, will be available to recipients in non-profit institutions, civil society organizations, industry associations, and academics for projects of up to three years duration. The number of grants bestowed is dependent on the number of promising applications. These applications will be subject to a competitive process of external and confidential expert peer review. Renewal funding is possible and contingent on submitting timely reports demonstrating satisfactory progress.\n\nProposals will be evaluated according to their relevance and expected impact.\n\nRecipients could choose to allocate the funding in myriad ways, including:\n\n- Recruitment of movement-building and community organization professionals to supercharge efforts.\n- Providing support to existing organizations within/representing stakeholder groups to support AI safety education and engagement.\n- Coordinating and organizing highly-visible public demonstrations on AI safety issues (online or in-person).\n- Funding for specific new initiatives or even new organizations committed to educating and activating specific constituencies on AI safety issues.\n- Planning and executing events, social media campaigns and other communications activities to engage groups and the general public.\n- Conducting and disseminating research into the impacts of AI on specific communities to educate and activate them.\n- Creating tools and channels for the engagement/activation of different groups, or to facilitate widespread activism.\n\n## V. Timeline and Application Process\n\nThere is an open call for Letters of Intent (LOI). The deadline for these LOI is Tuesday, February 4, 2025 at 11:59pm Eastern Time.\n\nApplicants will be informed by Monday, February 24, 2025 if they are invited to submit a full proposal.

This is typically the case when we want to bring about systems change. Choosing the right approach allows us to combine our ability to act with an appreciation of uncertainty.\n\nwhen to use it?\n\nTo help you choose the most appropriate futures tool for what you are doing. Pathways approaches are needed for most work which involves convening many stakeholders to bring about systems change.\n\nBenefits - how does this help?\n\n![](https://futurestewards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/images/d5bc1d07da441b85aad009dc8037e11a6c84a662e29046f3b13a3fae62453f75.jpg)\n\nForecasts are based on extrapolation and work well where the past is a good guide to the future Roadmaps bring people together for shared action and are good for shaping technology evolution Scenarios tell stories of the uncertain future we might face, and are useful ways to test our plans Pathways enable flexible navigation towards a visionary goal, whilst leaving adaptive and transformative moves open to deal with emergent and unexpected conditions\n\n# 1\n\n# 4 ways to work with the uncertain future\n\n# roadmaps\n\nRoadmaps develop agency by pooling purpose around emerging opportunities. They coordinate the actions of many players for shared learning and deployment of new solutions e.g. mobile communications through five generations.\n\n# forecasts\n\nGovernments and businesses make quantitative forecasts based on continuing past trends. They work well until the unexpected happens, like the financial crash or the 2020 pandemic. They are not good for handling qualitative uncertainty.\n\n![](https://futurestewards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/images/f3834406a5461d331c44ff77dc3b34fbfd09eed8e90af0e4e106edd81974467f.jpg)\n\n# UNCERTAINTY\n\n# pathways\n\nClimate change action needs us to hold the visionary and directional intent of roadmaps, while being ready and able to adapt to uncertainty and learning. Three Horizons helps hold together all the tools we need for treading the path.\n\n# scenarios\n\nScenarios organise our thinking around a small number of major uncertainties, and create stories about what those worlds would look like. They can be used like wind-tunnels to test our strategies.\n\n# Three Horizons\n\n# 2\n\n# summary\n\n# A simple and intuitive way to map patterns of change:\n\nis the dominant way things are done now, which shows Horizon 1 signs of strain and lack of fit to the future.\n\nis how we want things to be in the future (the vision Horizon 3 we’re working towards).\n\nis an arena of transition, where innovations get Horizon 2 established to help make our desired future a reality.\n\nwhen to use it?\n\nTo bring different stakeholders onto the same page, to create a map of your area of concern that includes the current challenges you face (H1), your vision(s) of the future (H3) and the innovation and action you can focus on to get there (H2).\n\nBenefits - how does this help?\n\n![](https://futurestewards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/images/bdd7bd4b92e8d9055277fe8b8119ddbd0d492efcca348c58b6577333c9b71f1c.jpg)\n\nH3Uni & IFF\n\n![](https://futurestewards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/images/3b5689e59dbaf5bddfbfb2d45a137024df0c2a8edd41f3bda8ba1acdd04df1d9.jpg)\n\nHelps a group make sense of any situation demanding systemic change, and sets up the\n\nuse of System Maps (see tool)\n\nGives people a shared language and map for understanding the problems they are facing\n\nDistinguishes between innovation that sustains the current system (H2-) from transformative innovation (H2+)\n\nCreates a template for constructive dialogue between people who are responsible for the way things\n\nare and those who want change\n\nHelps teams get into action\n\n# Example: electricity transition\n\n# 2\n\n![](https://futurestewards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/images/40d56af695583cdb76db1c3e5d4ddb1cf79842060189f0db69385d1040d43acc.jpg)\n\nThis tool identifies innovations that, even if helpful in the short term, will not bring about the change we want overall - we call these innovations H2-. It also identifies policies and innovations that could be the growth points of the new H3 vision - what we call $\\\\vdash 2 +$ .\n\nIn the case of power, we can see that replacing coal with gas would be H2-, while feed-in tariffs are $\\\\textsf { H } 2 +$ , thus encouraging the shift to renewables while allowing competition between them. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has a future-oriented use, but might also delay the shift away from fossil fuels.\n\n# Regenerative worldview\n\n# COLLABORATING WITH NATURAL SYSTEMS\n\n# summary\n\n# 3\n\nThe climate crisis is part of a larger imperative for humankind to bring patterns of life back to a positive relationship to the planet. Doing less harm is not enough. Every system should aim to have positive effects on all the others of which it is a part.\n\nwhen to use it?\n\n# REGENERATING SYSTEM\n\nTo reframe long-term ambition towards the abundance of regenerative futures that serve people, planet and prosperity (rather than a competition between economy and environment).\n\nBenefits - how does this help?\n\nFRAGMENTING NATURAL SYSTEMS\n\n# REGENERATIVE\n\nCo-evolution: humans collaborating with nature\n\n# RESTORATIVE\n\nHuman-centered; minimal standards\n\nHumans renewing damaged natural systems\n\nOrients change towards potential, rather than problems\n\nAims for regenerative systems so we can harness positive returns for change\n\nUnifies thinking across social and ecological systems\n\nFrames vision and ambition for Horizon 3, when using Three Horizons\n\nSUSTAINABLE No additional damage\n\n# GREEN\n\nRelative improvement\n\n# EXTRAcTIVE\n\n# What does it mean to be regenerative?\n\n# 3\n\n# How does your organisation interact with its direct stakeholders?\n\nWhat are the inputs and outputs of the day-to-day operations and are they in a healthy relationship with immediate social and ecological processes?\n\nFor a farmer, it might be a mindset shift from being an owner/manager of a resource to a steward of the land.

To reach a zero carbon world, we have to create new patterns. We use system maps to indicate the actors involved in the process of change, and the relationships between them.\n\n# summary\n\nwhen to use it?\n\nTo identify who matters to a transition, how they can be part of the new pattern, and where campaigns can be focused.\n\nBenefits - how does this help?\n\nEnables everyone to see how they are part of the change Identifies potential for reinforcing ambition loops between the actors within and across national boundaries Provides focal points for Climate Champions’ campaigns to enrol people into the shared pathways of action\n\n# Example: zero emission land transport\n\n# 4\n\nSystem maps provide focal points for Climate Champions’ campaigns. They aim to build reinforcing ambition loops between the actors within and across national boundaries, taking them through the three stages of transition (along shared pathways).\n\n# Objective\n\n![](https://futurestewards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/images/5f1df8565abc9d068f41c2d7ef1c96774bb202f0e3d7f58fb4cd36f6c8732d42.jpg)\n\n![](https://futurestewards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/images/3c15f098196b8d2df92286943438bc483a7a449bdb754b539336cf530d08ab60.jpg)\n\nLeaders support shift to 100% zero emission vehicle sales\n\n# 5\n\n# Accelerating transitions framework\n\n# summary\n\nSystem transitions generally happen in three stages: emergence, diffusion and reconfiguration. At each stage, different policies, and different kinds of international cooperation, are likely to be effective in accelerating the transition.\n\n# when to use it?\n\nTo identify the form of national action and international cooperation most likely to be effective in any given sector appropriate to the stage of transition that it has reached.\n\nBenefits - how does this help?\n\nHelps identify which actors can cooperate, in which ways, to accelerate the transition in a given sector at a given tim Focuses national policy and international coordination on joint action (rather than negotiating targets). Organises cooperation into stages that can grow in strength over time. At the beginning of a transition, we do not need consensus among all actors on the entirety of the solution. It can be more achievable, and more effective, to coordinate among a small group on the next steps to be taken. As progress is made, this can pave the way for deeper agreements among larger sets of actors.\n\n# Example: power & shipping\n\n# 5\n\n# Each sector will go through the stages of transition in its own unique way.\n\nIn the ‘emergence’ stage of the transition to clean power, several countries contributed to the development of solar photovoltaics and wind turbines. Now that transition is into the ‘diffusion’ stage, these technologies are becoming widespread. Practical assistance with electricity market reforms can help countries mobilise investment and make clean power affordable. Each country that deploys solar and wind technologies helps bring the cost down for others.\n\nAs the transition approaches ‘reconfiguration’ stage, wider shifts in power systems and related socio-economic systems become the central concern. Priorities for cooperation include the development of enabling technologies (such as energy storage) and the development of new economic opportunities for communities (such as coal-workers) who could otherwise be left behind by the transition.\n\n![](https://futurestewards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/images/9d4d16b1ac93e3ff9abc22677df6147d4ce95c08c05c37a1ce163ec65c0dc535.jpg)\n\nThe shipping sector is still at the ‘emergence’ stage of transition, where coordinated development and testing of zero emission technologies is a high priority. To move to ‘diffusion’, countries will need to work together to create the conditions for first deployment on international routes. Eventually, reconfiguration of the sector will require global agreement on a new set of rules that makes zero emission technologies the only allowable option.\n\n# causal loops\n\n# summary\n\nModeling a situation with causal loops helps us see how it behaves over time. For example, how effects become causes, how some things are reinforced over time and others are weakened. This helps us understand the dynamic effect of policies, and see what interventions might be most effective.\n\nwhen to use it?\n\nTo bring about rapid change; to see how a reinforcing loop starts to draw actors and resources into new solutions; to see what will act to balance or oppose the change.\n\n![](https://futurestewards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/images/b1ea7958d061eac34c22965fcce39986a0f586a23b263a03496a763014167e6d.jpg)\n\nBenefits - how does this help?\n\nIdentify interventions that are self-propelling / self-amplifying\n\nAvoid interventions that are self-defeating / self-limiting\n\nPlan a range of interventions so that their effect is more than the sum of their parts (not less than)\n\nIdentify points of leverage for systems change, i.e. places where there is a high return on effort\n\nUse as a modelling tool for ambition loops and system maps\n\n# Examples: reinforcing and balancing\n\n![](https://futurestewards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/images/e4c8b607aa33ea0f3cdaad6422119d84db2b4cb514c65f967a10c9e475d7ecc3.jpg)\n\n![](https://futurestewards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/images/07691a7869dab158a98f0123d60ae02502ba3b3d7908475559adfa7210042502.jpg)\n\n# Reinforcing (R): exponential improvement\n\nNew technologies usually benefit from reinforcing feedbacks. For example, ‘learning by doing’ (the more we make something, the better we get at making it), and economies of scale (the more we make it, the cheaper it becomes, then demand grows and we make more of it). Policies that directly support the development and deployment of new technologies help to strengthen these reinforcing feedbacks. This can lead to exponential improvement in performance and price reduction, as in the case of solar and wind power.\n\n# Balancing (B): reducing incentives\n\nSometimes policies inadvertently create balancing feedbacks, which tend to slow down or prevent change.\n\nIn a cap-and-trade emissions trading system: ... the more one participant reduces their emissions, ... the less demand there is for emissions permits, ... the lower the carbon price becomes, ... the less incentive there is for other participants to reduce their emissions.\n\nThe EU has introduced a ‘market stability reserve’ to its emissions trading system, making it function more like a tax, to limit the extent of this effect.\n\n# 7\n\n# Exponential goals\n\n# summary\n\nChanges can happen rapidly when everyone settles on one approach. We can then move along an ‘S-curve’ of exponential change, where new technology improves its performance, causing lower costs and increasing adoption by society.\n\n# Zero emission light duty vehicles\n\n100% zero emission light vehicles sales by 2035 will require reaching 15% by 2025 and 75% by 2030\n\n![](https://futurestewards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/images/176bd39a6b261c6f3bce4543339e56fa6f28b5e3cfbeec5102b7fa38f4a9d102.jpg)\n\nEV sales as % of global light vehicle sales\n\nwhen to use it?\n\nTo focus attention on technologies consistent with a zero emission future, and what can be done to help them develop and spread rapidly through markets and society.\n\nBenefits $\\\\cdot$ how does this help?\n\nDirects attention to the new zero emission solutions and how to bring them into being (Horizon 3 innovation) instead of incremental change to existing solutions (Horizon 1 improvement) Encourages focus on solutions with high potential for improvement from learning and deployment Helps us appreciate the potential for rapid change and set ambitious goals beyond current performance of new technologies\n\n# Example: solar and wind power\n\nSolar and wind power technologies are experiencing exponential growth. In the past decade, each time the amount of global, installed solar capacity has doubled, its cost has declined by $34 %$ . Each time the amount of installed onshore wind capacity has doubled, its cost has fallen by $1 7 %$ .\n\nThe pace of change has far outstripped our expectations. Global deployment of solar PV in 2020 was over 10-times higher than had been predicted just 15 years earlier.\n\nSolar and wind are now the cheapest sources of power in most parts of the world, and make up more than $80 %$ of new global power capacity additions.\n\n![](https://futurestewards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/images/3703f80a575d482cf4ad7dd7adbd14da1bbd2f2701c4011bd9ee0f7ae8d5dcd8.jpg)\n\n# Tipping points and cascades\n\n# summary\n\nA tipping point is a place where a small intervention can trigger a large response, sending a system into a qualitatively different future state. In transitions, tipping points can exist where a new solution becomes more affordable, accessible, profitable, attractive, socially acceptable, or higher performing than old solutions.\n\nOnce a critical mass of actors has adopted a new technology or practice this can prompt the rest to follow, triggering a rapid system-wide cascade of change throughout the sector.\n\nwhen to use it?\n\nTo identify the level of effort, or extent of an intervention, that could lead to disproportionately large results and can therefore serve as a policy or international cooperation goal.\n\nBenefits $^ { \\\\ast }$ how does this help?\n\nHelps identify opportunities to greatly accelerate the pace of change, making the transition self-propelling Provides a positive goal for everyone to aim for: the point where a new way of doing things becomes cheaper, better, more accessible, more profitable or otherwise more attractive than the old Provides clarity of objectives in the midst of complexity\n\n# Example: EV tipping points and cascades\n\n![](https://futurestewards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/images/3ea009f88adcdaa9dfda3b60abd2474d97d520dc188c549b4e1a7f87e1a88ee7.jpg)\n\n# Ambition loops\n\n# summary\n\nSocietal change involves those who govern, those who produce and invest in making things, and all of us as citizens and users. Ambition loops help us explore how we all come together to create and sustain bold action, and create rapid, self-reinforcing change.\n\nwhen to use it?\n\n# Prime movers\n\nUse with system maps to explore where leadership for change can originate, and how to link up actors in positive reinforcing loops.\n\nBenefits - how does this help?\n\nEncourages reinforcing action towards change amongst all the actors in society\n\nDraws attention to understanding policy as a dynamic, systemic, process which changes the landscape\n\nDevelops approaches for collaboration that can move the whole system to exponential improvements\n\nand tipping points\n\nSupports the use of the Accelerating Transitions Framework\n\n# Aviation accounts for around $1 . 5 %$ of global greenhouse gas emissions, growing about $4 %$ per year.\n\nDecarbonisation solutions, such as batteries for short haul and synthetic fuels for long haul, are still in the emergence stage and face cost/ performance adoption barriers. They need coordinated action amongst all system actors to create niches where they can get onto their S-curves of improvement.\n\n![](https://futurestewards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/images/94d75c243790370f8fc0c0215b0e4106fd334c3a7d1b747eee114d9d58a7b3fd.jpg)\n\nThis is a sketch of how ambition loops can be developed within an overall system map.\n\n# The power of convening\n\n# summary\n\nExpert teams with the best frameworks may still experience blockers and breakdowns if they haven’t considered how to bring together stakeholders thoughtfully. Convening diverse groups enables divergent perspectives to be heard, creating the space for shared problem solving and action.\n\nwhen to use it?\n\nTo bring together a group (of any size) to address your chosen topic.

      "content": "© 2023 Future Today Institute\n2\nIn August 2017, a rare explosive event known\nas GW17817 took place in space. Two stars\ncollided, unleashing a blast energetic enough\nto form an incalculable number of new stellar\nbits that continue to travel through interstellar\nspace. Over time, this stardust will combine into\nsmall objects, evolve into large rocks, fuse with\neven more material, and form into planets. One\nincredibly violent disruption will someday lead\nto the formation of a new corner of the universe.\nThis is how our own sun and Earth, and all of\nhuman existence, came into being.\nLately it’s as if we’ve been living through the\naftermath of cataclysmic explosions: the\nrelease of generative artificial intelligence\nsystems like ChatGPT and Midjourney, a fusion\nbreakthrough that could someday generate\nzero-carbon energy, Russia’s ongoing invasion\ninto Ukraine, deep uncertainty about a global\nrecession, and AlphaFold’s protein-folding al-\ngorithms that predicted structures for nearly all\ncataloged proteins known to science, to name\na few. These and other forces of change are\ncolliding, going supernovae, and resulting in an\nunfathomable amount of new signals—bits of\nchange that, over time, result in the trends that\nshape society.\nNow more than ever, it’s important to carefully\ntrack new trends as they emerge. But that isn’t\neasy, given the rapid pace of change. For that\nreason, the theme of our 2023 Tech Trends report\nis Focus. It is crucial to focus when new signals\nare forming because some may be lasting and\ndevelop into impactful trends, while others might\nburn out and fade away. In an increasingly com-\nplex and fast-paced world, leaders who focus\non the trends that matter and adapt to changing\ncircumstances make better decisions and see\nimproved outcomes. Trends enable them to antic-\nipate near-term change, understand the factors\ninfluencing their industries, and develop a point of\nview on the future.\nOur research is presented in 14 in-depth reports\nthat reveal the current state of play, a list of influ-\nencers to watch, key trends, detailed examples,\nexpert perspectives and recommendations de-\nsigned to help executives and their teams devel-\nop their strategic positioning. Some of the trends\nare new advancements on mature technologies,\nwhile others represent frontier technologies and\nareas of science. When we look at them collec-\ntively, new centers of gravity come into focus, and\nwe can glimpse the impacts they will have on\nevery sector.\nTrends on their own cannot predict the future.\nRather, future-focused organizations use them to\ndeeply reflect on the tension between long-term\nand short-term goals and to reduce uncertainty.\nBy understanding the trends and changes shap-\ning the landscape, executives can make informed\ndecisions and capitalize on new opportunities in\nthe year ahead.\nWe invite you to join us in observing how the star-\ndust settles into new signals and trends.\nShare your feedback with us at\n2023trends@futuretodayinstitute.com.\nAmy Webb\nChief Executive Officer\nFuture Today Institute\nTHIS YEAR REQUIRES FOCUS\n2023 Tech Trends Report Executive Summary\n2023\n\n3\n© 2023 Future Today Institute\nLong-Term RelevanceNear-Term Relevance\nAIGenerative AI\nClimate and\nGreen Tech\nMobility\nAR/ VR/ XR and\nSynthetic Media\nRobots and\nDrones\nWeb3\nInfrastructure\nBioengineeringMetaverseQuantum\nAgriculture\nAutomotive\nAviation and Travel\nConstruction, Engineering\nConsumer Packaged Goods\nEducation\nFinancial Services\nGovernment and Policy\nHealth Care Systems and Services\nHospitality\nMedia (Entertainment)\nMedia (News)\nPharmaceutical and Medical Products\nPublic and Social Sectors\nReal Estate\nRestaurants\nRetail\nSpace and Aerospace Defense\nSupply Chain and Logistics\nTelecommunications\nIMPACT OF TRENDS ON YOUR INDUSTRY\n2023 Tech Trends Report Executive Summary\n2023\n\n5\n© 2023 Future Today Institute\nAI TRENDS SUMMARY\nAI is a force\nmultiplier on\ntechnological\nprogress because\nit is an enabler of\nother technologies\nand powers\nthe evolution\nof business,\ngovernment, and\nsociety.\nKey Insights for 2023\nWe have entered the “text-to-everything” era.\nSoon, we will use natural language to operate\nand interact with computers rather than graphic\nuser interfaces (GUIs).\nWe expect to see increased activity in the\nspecialized AI accelerators space this year.\nWatch the UK’s Graphcore, which built a new\ntype of processor for machine intelligence to\naccelerate machine learning and AI applications,\nand Cerebras, which built one of the fastest AI\naccelerators based on the largest processor in\nthe industry, as well as AWS Inferentia accelera-\ntors. Will Nvidia’s GPU/AI accelerator moat get\ndisrupted this year?\nIt’s possible for agents to learn the right skills\nbut the wrong objectives; an AI system can\nbe asked to learn something that then could\nbe used for harmful purposes. Commercial AI\nproducts could inadvertently incentivize bad\nbehavior.\nGENERATIVE AI\nIf the 2010s were known for perception AI—sys-\ntems that sensed signals such as images and\ntext—to understand the world around us, the\nand augment human creativity.\nVertically integrated solutions will garner a\nhigher transactional value. Some companies\nwill win by providing “a refined/value-added\nLLM product” to the end consumer and meeting\nthe customer in desired distribution channels,\nsuch as LLMs for health care, legal, finance, and\narchitecture.\nIn the next 12-18 months, watch for the prolif-\neration of large-scale open-source models and\ntools including Stable Diffusion and Hugging-\nFace.\nPublicly available LLMs are often the founda-\ntion for AI startups, but some researchers and\ntechnologists are questioning their defensibility\nwhen it comes to capturing value. The moat is\nin data. Techniques and models will largely get\ncommoditized, and served via the infrastructure\nlayer, where real value will be realized.\nLong-term sustainability depends on network\neffects to gather enough user data. User-gen-\nerated data can be harnessed to differentiate\nsystems by offering tuned models on top of\nfoundational/commoditized LLMs, creating a\nflywheel effect. Longer term, we expect to see\nniche LLMs owned by a select few players, while\ngeneral-purpose LLMs become commoditized.\n2020s will be known for generative AI. These\nsystems not only sense and understand the\nworld but can also generate new content, con-\ncepts, and ideas while communicating with us.\nAI is emerging as an assistant for all knowledge\nworkers. Within the next 18-24 months, we will\nsee assistive technology developed for a variety\nof professions. Think: GitHub’s Copilot for finan-\ncial analysts, commercial real estate developers,\nand lawyers.\nIn the next 18-24 months, generative AI will\nbe incorporated into consumer applications.\nAlready, Canva, the popular online graphic\ndesign tool, has integrated Stable Diffusion in its\nplatform. Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI’s\nDALL-E 2 image-generating system into its Mic-\nrosoft Designer and Image Creator applications,\nwhich is a big upgrade to clip art. Google’s Bard\nincludes an API to encourage developers to\nstart building new products. Notion, the freemi-\num productivity and note-taking web applica-\ntion, uses LLMs for assistive writing.\nGeneral-purpose models will be commoditized\nin the near-future. This will lead to large lan-\nguage model (LLM) features being integrated\ninto every app. The first players to succeed in\nthe space will likely be creative apps, and all of\nthem will have LLMs as a backbone to inspire\nArtificial Intelligence\nTECH\n\n6\n© 2023 Future Today Institute\nAI TRENDS SUMMARY\nAt the infrastructure layer, we anticipate a vari-\nety of generative AI services built to better serve\na variety of applications. In addition to OpenAI,\nspecialized players are entering the market,\nincluding AI21, Cohere, Snorkel.AI, and Scale.AI.\nENTERPRISE\nTop talent will start breaking away from the\nlargest players—Google, OpenAI, Meta—to form\ntheir own startups, which will include conversa-\ntional agents, artificial general intelligence pro-\ngrams, AI-first biotech companies, and the like.\nConsolidation will continue to be a driving\ntheme in 2023. Here’s just one example: Mic-\nrosoft plans to increase its investment in and\nleverage OpenAI for Bing to pull market share\naway from Google search.\nGoogle’s powerful ChatGPT rival, Bard, uses an\nAI model called LaMDA. Launched February\n2023, could catalyze a new race for conversa-\ntional search.\nWe anticipate increased enterprise adoption of\nAI. Leaders see AI as necessary for growth in\nthe current macroeconomic environment, even\nas new developments make some job catego-\nries obsolete.\nREGULATION AND GEOPOLITICS\nWill this be the year the government breaks up\nBig Tech? US lawmakers have begun work to\ndecouple Google’s ad business from the rest of\nthe organization. In the European Union, pow-\nerful new regulations of tech platforms could go\ninto effect. In China, regulators have eased up\nslightly on Big Tech crackdowns—but the Chi-\nnese Communist Party is intent on focusing new\nR&D toward servicing the country’s long-term\ngrowth ambitions.\nAUTOMATION\nAI coding assistants will grow in popularity.\nOpenAI’s Codex, introduced in 2021, evolved\nfrom research to open commercialization by\nthe middle of last year. GitHub CoPilot is now\navailable as a subscription ($10 per month). As\nof January, Amazon’s CodeWhisperer is available\nin preview. Internally, Google is using a machine\nlanguage–powered code completion tool—it\nmay at some point be made available to every-\nday users, possibly this year.\nWe expect to see AI more deeply integrated\ninto health care and life sciences later this year.\nGenerative AI will yield new proteins, antibodies,\nand drugs, while biology and chemistry-specific\nmodels will result in faster discovery, further\nproviding practical use cases and leading to\nincreased investment.\nCould 2023 mark the beginning of the end of\nhuman radiologists? Lithuania-based Oxipit, an\nAI-first medical imaging startup, built an auton-\nomous system that reports on chest X-rays that\nshow no abnormalities. The technology is good\nenough that it received state-level certification\nto operate independently, without a radiologist\nin the loop.\nArtificial Intelligence\nTECH\n\n7\n© 2023 Future Today Institute\nalgorithms, or generative AI systems. Risk\nmodels should be developed to determine\nplausible near-futures, so that leaders can\nadjust their strategies accordingly.\nWhen it comes to talent and workforce\ndevelopment, the need for highly skilled\npeople is fast outpacing the graduation rate\nof universities. This might lead to a shift in\nhigher education: It’s plausible that compa-\nnies in search of AI specialists might opt for\nmodular certifications, which can be earned\nfaster than traditional four-year degrees.\nTalent sourcing and retention will continue\nto pose challenges for tech companies—\nand for organizations in other industries\nthat need a trained workforce but may not\nbe able to provide the same perks as the\nhottest AI players.\nIn nearly every industry, AI will serve as a\nforce multiplier for growth, bringing efficien-\ncies, better tracking, business intelligence,\nand assistance with decision-making. As\ntraining costs decline, more applications\nwill be built. Spending on AI systems and\nhardware is likely to explode this decade,\ncreating significant enterprise value overall.\nAs no-code and low-code applications be-\ncome more widely available, Future Today\nInstitute analysis shows that innovation\nteams will be in position to build powerful\nsystems for decision management, busi-\nness intelligence, and product ideation.\nGenerative AIs will improve an organiza-\ntion’s efficiency and enhance creativity,\nleading to hybrid human-machine creative\nteams. AI-assisted design will dramatically\nincrease the number of prototypes that can\nbe automatically generated with prompts.\nWe recommend that chief strategy officers\nin every field develop a solid understanding\nof AI to engage more closely with others in\nthe C-suite to develop a cohesive point of\nview on digitalization, augmentation and\nautomation—as well as to develop strate-\ngic plans. Importantly, businesses should\nkeep abreast of emerging regulations that\ncould restrict the use of consumer data,\nArtificial Intelligence\nTECH\nArtificial intelligence\nshould be part of\nevery strategic plan,\nas it crosses multiple\ndimensions, from\nworkforce automation,\nto digital transformation,\nto everyday business\nprocesses and\nbusiness intelligence.\nIt is imperative that\nexecutives and senior\nmanagers understand\nwhat AI is, what it is not,\nand what strategic value\nit adds to the business.\nHOW TO PREPARE\nWhat should your organization do now to prepare for these trends?\n\n8\n© 2023 Future Today Institute\n3456782\n1\nKEY QUESTIONS FOR YOUR TEAM\nHow do these\ntrends change\nour perspective\non our current AI\ninvestment and\ncapabilities?\nIs our organization\npositioned to\nleverage AI for\ngrowth, in addition\nto realizing new\nefficiencies?\nWhen we engage in\nlong-term strategic\nplanning, how does\nthe evolution of AI\nfactor in?\nAre we adequately\npreparing our\nworkforce to\nsucceed in a\nworld in which\ntheir knowledge\ntasks might be\naugmented or fully\nautomated by AI?\nWhat is our process\nto vet, verify\nand monitor our\nvendors?\nIs the AI we’re using\nexplainable?\nIf not, does that\nopen us up to\nadditional risk?\nDoes our team\nhave an expansive\nenough viewpoint\non emerging\nthreats and attack\nsurfaces?\nWhat parts of our\nbusiness make us\nvulnerable as AI\nevolves?\nWhat is our point\nof view on the use\nof generative AI\nsystems?\nIf proposed\nantitrust legislation\npasses in the US\nand the EU further\nregulates Big\nTech companies,\nhow does this\ncreate a strategic\nopportunity for our\norganization?\n Or, what might our\norganization lose?\n9\nHow might we\ndevelop the\nknowledge,\nexperience, and\ntalent in place to\nleverage these AI\ntrends?\n10\nArtificial Intelligence\nTECH\n\n10\n© 2023 Future Today Institute\nWEB3 TRENDS SUMMARY\nA trustless and\ndecentralized web\nholds significant\nbenefits for\nconsumers and\nbusinesses and will\nenable them to\nengage seamlessly.\nKey Insights for 2023\nSecurity is top of mind for those invested in Web\n3.0. Cybersecurity breaches across 2021 and\n2022 exposed nascent Web 3.0 systems’ weak-\nnesses, which platforms will need to address to\nensure Web 3.0 is reliable and scalable.\nEfforts are emerging to use Web 3.0 capabilities\nfor public good. From tracking environmen-\ntal sustainability, to improving access to food,\nand archiving items of historical importance,\nemerging blockchain solutions go beyond art\nexchanges and decentralized currency to try to\nsolve some of the world’s most pressing prob-\nlems.\nProof of work consensus mechanisms were the\ncornerstone of early blockchain protocols, but\nproof of stake is rapidly emerging as the lead-\ning consensus tool because of its efficiency,\nreduced need for computing power, and less\nonerous environmental impact.\nTracking the origin and ownership of items, con-\ntent, data, and assets continues to be the pre-\ndominant use of blockchain, but the technology\nis expanding beyond its initial focus on NFTs\n(non-fungible tokens) to include personal data,\nvirtual representations of real-world assets, and\nother types of data.\nHealth care, food, supply chain, journalism,\nand energy are some of the industries that will\nsee Web 3.0 uses expand and new capabilities\nemerge in the coming year.\nDigital identity is a key area of development in\nthe Web 3.0 landscape. For Web 3.0 to function,\nindividuals will require methods of identification\nand ways to validate transactions, but the tools\nto do so are still inchoate.\nRegulation of Web 3.0 technologies is being de-\nveloped in a variety of countries. Organizations\nthat provide or use Web 3.0 capabilities will\nneed to remain informed about these regula-\ntions to ensure they are in compliance.\nWeb 3.0 is changing the way individuals interact\nglobally. While governments are mostly shaping\nregulations today, large communities are already\nbeginning to form in Web 3.0 that have a com-\nparable level of economic power. Regulations\nthat do not take into account the borderless\nnature of Web 3.0 may be difficult to apply in\nreal-world settings.\nWeb3\nTECH\n\n11\n© 2023 Future Today Institute\nclosely tracked its development, however,\nand grew with the technology, were well\nequipped to pounce when the technology\nscaled (think: Amazon or Nintendo).\nOver the next five to 10 years, Web3 will en-\nable a growing number of applications for\ngovernmental, corporate, and consumer use\nthat extend well beyond financial or mar-\nketing applications.

Ultra-high-voltage power lines, pow-\ner-beaming microwaves, and space-based\nsolar power are among the solutions that will\nallow energy to be transferred to undersupplied\nregions or moved to areas experiencing energy\nshortages.\nGrids are becoming more resilient and dynamic.\nThis will be of supreme importance as more in-\ntense storms and forest fires increase as climate\nchange worsens.\nEMISSIONS REMOVAL\nVolcanic sand and genetically edited crops\ncould be significant natural carbon capture\nand storage (CCS) opportunities, in addition\ning requirements.\nFormer landfills and mining sites can be repur-\nposed for renewable energy development. They\noften have existing infrastructure and permitting\nadvantages compared to other swaths of real\nestate.\nThe Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s\nNational Ignition Facility produced a nuclear\nfusion reaction that resulted in a net energy\ngain. Decades in the making, the breakthrough\npotentially paves the way for emissions-free\nenergy—though realistically that won’t happen\nfor decades more. Many challenges remain,\nincluding devising the supporting infrastructure\nand storage for fusion energy.\nNew methods of harvesting energy can supple-\nment or replace more traditional carbon-emit-\nting energy sources. Waves, tides, and currents\nin bodies of water could provide more reliable\nsources of energy than wind or solar. Even\nsweat can provide a way to power small elec-\ntronics and medical devices, producing no toxic\nbyproducts.\nRare earths can be found in mining waste,\nopening the door to diversifying the world’s sup-\nply.

A suite of new products ranging from\nfashion accessories to imitation meat can be\nmade from the captured gas. The most viable\nproducts will combat environmental challeng-\nes by not only taking excess carbon out of the\natmosphere, but also minimizing processes that\nemit extra carbon dioxide.\nTracking technologies are enabling both con-\nsumers and manufacturers to take control of\ntheir carbon footprints. Companies can develop\ncompetitive advantages by being more trans-\nparent with their value chains, appealing to\nenvironmentally conscious consumers.\nEMISSIONS REDUCTIONS\nCarbon-neutral or carbon-negative cement, 3D\nprinting and AI-aided project planning, and the\nuse of alternative materials such as recycled\nplastic all have the potential to significantly\nreduce the construction sector’s emissions.\nBy using computer vision to better identify\nmaterials, recycling programs can boost their\naccuracy and profitability and thereby increase\nopportunities to bring new life to old products.\nNew materials are radically changing the built\nenvironment and bringing new life to the con-\nstruction industry. A suite of biomaterials and\nadvanced materials science will reduce carbon\nemissions and even result in carbon being\nstored within these new materials.\nConsumer and industrial products are being\nequipped with solar and electric capabilities to\nreduce carbon emissions and provide reliable\nsolutions for unstable energy grids. They are\nalso being equipped with capabilities for reduc-\ning microplastics in the ocean.\nThe transportation sector is minimizing emis-\nsions through a series of innovations that im-\nprove vehicle aerodynamics, optimize charging,\nand even enable vehicles to be charged while\nmoving. These innovations will be necessary for\na critical mass of users to adopt electric alterna-\ntives.\nBehavioral changes such as shifting to plant-\nbased diets or using renewable energy for heat-\ning, cooling, and cooking will have measurable\neffects on reducing carbon emissions.\nENVIRONMENTAL MANIPULATION\nRewilding projects are growing and are getting\na lot of public support, as healthy and balanced\necosystems also help combat climate change.\nCloud manipulation—brightening or seed-\ning—might help reduce Earth’s temperature or\nincrease the amount of rain. Overall implications\nto the world’s ecosystem are not clear.\nThe oceans could be our best bet for removing\nCO2 from the air, if humans “help” them by, for\nexample, adjusting their alkalinity or encourag-\ning the growth of phytoplankton. However, the\neffects of these experiments on the wider mari-\ntime ecosystem have not been explored.\nEFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE\nUsing AI, satellites, and drones to monitor the\neffects of climate change reveals data and\nnew discoveries that otherwise would remain\nunknowable.\nNew types of city projects have garnered atten-\ntion as climate change forces humanity to re-\nthink where and how we live. Examples include\ndomed, floating, and underground cities—all of\nwhich completely upend life as we know it.\nClimate & Energy\nTECH\n\n25\n© 2023 Future Today Institute\nTHREATS\nCybersecurity\nTechnology enables and facilitates the shift to\nenvironmentally friendly processes in many of\nour most important industries—energy, food,\nindustrial processes. However, this also makes\nthose industries vulnerable to cyberattacks. As\nyou upgrade your company’s digital infrastruc-\nture, are you making sure that your systems are\nadequately protected? And how are you prepar-\ning for outages caused by cyberattacks?\nUnexpected Impacts\nDisrupted supply chains have caused balloon\nflights from the National Weather Service’s\nStorm Prediction Center to be canceled, reduc-\ning data collection and compromising forecasts.\nThe number of cities across Europe declaring\nclean air zones is expected to rise exponen-\ntially by 2025, forcing polluting vehicles off the\nroad and possibly affecting last-mile delivery.\nMost leaders are aware of the direct impacts of\nclimate change and environmental regulations\non their businesses—shortages of raw materi-\nals, for instance, or a fragile supply chain. But\nare you aware of the second- and third-order\nimpacts on your business of shifts in consumer\nbehavior and an evolving regulatory landscape?\n A Shortage of Qualified Workers\nAlthough many tech workers have left the indus-\ntry to find climate-related roles, the world will\nstill face a dearth of talent dedicated to ensuring\na climate-resilient future. Roles will become\nincreasingly specialized, as the need for new\ntechnologies will also create the need for careful\noperation and maintenance. Universities can be\nslow to adjust to such changes, so climate-con-\nscious organizations will have to source and\ntrain much of the available talent on their own.\nPlanning for Climate Migration\nClimate migration will become an existential\nthreat sooner and to a greater degree than many\nare anticipating. As climate migration increases,\nbusinesses will have to adjust their operations,\nsupply chains, and skilled talent. Many will face\ndecisions to uphold human rights and equality.\nThe End of Greenwashing\nAre you prepared for complete transparency?\nAs the ability to track CO2 emissions increases\nand industries can account for and track emis-\nsions throughout the entire value chain and life-\ncycle of a product, it will be easy to determine\nwho greenwashes and who is implementing\ntruly environmentally friendly practices.\nOPPORTUNITIES\nInterim Solutions\nIt takes time—decades—to implement green\nprocesses and methods such as carbon cap-\nture and storage technologies or infrastructure\nupgrades to accommodate renewable energies\nand distributed grids. Long interim periods\ncome with their own specific subsets of pain\npoints. Are there developments in your industry\nthat would benefit from products that address\nthese transient states?\nThe Energy Opportunity\nThe energy sector is experiencing a shift in the\npower dynamics of stakeholders as customers\ndemand and search for environmentally friendly\nproducts and services. Decentralization of the\ngrid and non-dispatchable energy sources such\nas wind and solar are not only introducing new\nplayers to the energy market, but demands on\nthe grid itself are fundamentally changing to\naccommodate frequent energy transformations\nand changes in energy direction. How can your\ncompany rethink energy, be it as a possible\nadditional product or an alternative form of\nproduction?\nEnvironmental Justice\nDiscussion about wealthy countries paying rep-\narations to smaller, poorer countries that are dis-\nproportionately affected by climate change has\ngained momentum. Wealthy nations pledged\npayments during the COP27 last year. How can\nyour company go beyond introducing green\npractices and help alleviate the damage done?\nGo Local\nBy reconfiguring supply chains, manufacturers\ncan source materials closer to production lines,\nminimizing the need to transport goods and\nproducts over long distances. Through innova-\ntions such as using repurposed carbon to make\nproducts, organizations can have more control\nover where products are made, allowing them to\nincorporate more instances of near shoring.\nGet Ahead of Regulation\nAs more emphasis continues to be placed on\nESG, the onus will be on organizations to pro-\nvide transparency into their inner workings and\nenvironmental impacts. It will behoove organi-\nzations to get ahead of these new expectations.\nAside from the adoption of more stringent ESGs\nfrom shareholders and investors, swift regulatory\nchanges will catch many organizations off guard\nand have significant bottom-line ramifications.\nClimate & Energy\nTECH\nHOW TO PREPARE\nWhat should your organization do now to prepare for these trends?\n\n26\n© 2023 Future Today Institute\nAre we aware of\nhow climate change\nwill affect our entire\nvalue chain?\nConsidering our\nlocation, supply\nchain, and the cost\nof raw materials,\nhow will our\ncustomers be\naffected?\nCan we produce our\nown energy, and\npotentially even sell\nsurplus energy to\nthird parties?\nHow can we and/or\nour vendors become\npart of the circular\neconomy?\n3\nWill our products\nor services still\nbe relevant in\na world that is\nmoving toward\nenvironmentally\nfriendly processes\nand a lifestyle\nsuited to a new\nclimate reality?\n4\nDoes my team or\ndepartment need\nnew skill sets to\noptimally address\nclimate or energy\nquestions?\n5\nDo we know our\ncomplete CO2\nfootprint, and\nare we prepared\nfor stricter\nenvironmental\nregulations?\n6\nCan we capture the\nCO2 we emit?

More autono-\nmous operations would help the three markets\nin their quest to solve the last mile delivery\nproblem.\nELECTRIFICATION\nCompanies are reimagining the interior of\nvehicles to improve the driver and passenger\nexperience, creating a third personal space for\nconsumers, outside their homes and workplac-\nes. EVs afford designers an open and blank\nmandates, as well as consumer expectations of\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG)\ngoals. These regulations may push other indus-\ntries to adapt and adjacent industries, such as\nwarehousing and wholesaling, may see price in-\ncreases as supply chains pass along new costs.\nDrastic shifts in how engines are powered and\ndesigned will shift the risk characteristics of the\nmobility industry, as well as the manufacturers\nof these components. These shifts may require\na re-examination of underwriting standards by\ninsurance carriers. Another consequence will\nlikely be a shortage of qualified vehicle mainte-\nnance professionals. As more automakers adopt\ndirect-to-consumer car sales, dealerships are\nfacing a very different future and their mainte-\nnance departments may disappear.\nVehicle expenses and insurance costs are likely\nto increase as additional entertainment options\nare added to vehicles. Customers will also be\nexposed to a growing number of new business\nmodels like subscription services that lock fac-\ntory-installed features behind a paywall, or more\ninstances of à la carte feature selection.\nThe market is moving toward consensus on the\nfuture of the EV market. Standardization of char-\nger types and connections, charging locations\nand access, and charging costs are coming into\nspace to work with. Entertainment is a focus,\nbut improved connectivity and comfort are\nalso factors, especially for companies looking\nto develop interiors for when fully autonomous\ndriving emerges and passengers can work, play,\nor relax in the vehicle. Reimagining how vehi-\ncles are used is encouraging non-automotive\ncompanies to capitalize on the growing market,\nand create a deeper connection between home\nand car.\nBidirectional charging will open up new markets\nand other uses for electric vehicles. EVs can\nnow power job sites or venues, supply emergen-\ncy power, and serve as a backup to the grid. One\nday, these vehicles could augment the broader\nelectrical grid or allow more homes to operate\noff-grid.\nEVs prices have already begun to drop, fueled\nby tax credits and companies lowering prices\nto entice consumers. Battery prices are also\nexpected to fall over the next five years as econ-\nomies of scale take shape, new materials and\nmethodologies become viable, and recycling\nbecomes more prominent.\nLegislation phasing out internal combustion\nengines has been enacted across the Europe-\nan Union, Canada, and a handful of US states.\nBusinesses will be forced to respond to these\nMobility, Robotics & Drones\nTECH\n\n29\n© 2023 Future Today Institute\nROBOTS, DRONES AND MOBILITY TRENDS SUMMARY\nfocus, but more legislation and regulations are\nneeded to bring the industry down a single path,\nrather than continuing to branch into numerous\nbusiness models.\nHydrogen fuel is without question an excellent\ngreen alternative, but adoption rates for this\ntechnology are still unclear. For construction\nor industrial operations out of reach of exist-\ning grids, hydrogen may present a cheaper\nalternative than installing longer-term solar or\nwind. Military operations may seek hydrogen\nfuel solutions if they are interested in lessening\ntheir carbon impact. However, it is likely that\nfossil fuel availability and the lack of needing to\nchange vehicle architecture will inhibit extensive\ngrowth here.\nAUTOMATION\nUltimately, automation will reduce risks in the\nworkplace and on roads since most accidents\nare caused by human error. Businesses should\nbe looking at increasing automation in their\noperations to reduce the risks of accidents and\ninjuries.\nRobots and drones are here to stay and they will\nimpact employment opportunities for workers.\nAt this point, a lack of capital investment is\nslowing widespread adoption, as well as the re-\nluctance to remove humans from the workplace.\nA large number of jobs can be automated, and\nlabor market shortages are compelling busi-\nnesses to increase robot adoption. Machines do\nnot ask for a raise, take time off, or need health\nbenefits. However, machines need a technically\ntrained workforce to maintain them and repair\nthem when they break down.\nA rise in automation also means that govern-\nments, labor or trade unions and organizations,\nacademic institutions, and nonprofits need to\nbegin preparing for and anticipating the wave\nof shifting employment needs. Former human\nemployees will need financial support. Students\nwill need to learn new skills and many former\nworkers may be forced back into school. Just\nas there are now ongoing discussions of how\nacademia needs to adjust to the release of\nChatGPT, there should be a re-examination of\nworker training for the automation age.\nAUTONOMY\nAutonomous vehicles, robots and drones pro-\nduce an immense amount of data, and most\ncompanies are not capturing enough of this valu-\nable information. Insights gleaned from this data\ncould drive efficiencies across operations, or be\nsold to interested parties from other industries.\nCompared to the steady adoption of EVs, the\nautonomous vehicle market is still uncertain.\nWhile a few key players are emerging, regula-\ntion is still muddled and inconsistent, though\nnew rounds of lawsuits and investigations may\nresolve some outstanding issues. However, in\norder for autonomous vehicles to scale, it will\nrequire cooperation across a complex spectrum\nof participants, including regulators (both state\nand national), technology developers, con-\nsumers, and those responsible for building the\ninfrastructure. A task that will be challenging\nand time consuming.\nDeveloping solutions to the last mile delivery\nproblem are of paramount importance. Trans-\nportation companies, robotics makers, and\ndrone producers are seeking ways to accom-\nplish this with little or no human intervention. If\ncompanies can develop drones that more viably\ntransport heavier packages with drones, this\nmay truly enable the elimination of some last\nmile deliveries that need to be completed with a\nvehicle or person. This could even expand to in-\ndustrial operations, allowing companies to move\nheavy materials around without fixed machinery\nor large vehicles. Construction companies could\nmove materials between job sites, and indus-\ntrial firms could move products across different\nstages of production.\nMobility, Robotics & Drones\nTECH\n\n30\n© 2023 Future Today Institute\nLabor shortages present challenges, and robots\nand drones offer solutions.\nDrones and robots can take over repetitive,\ndirty, and dangerous jobs, allowing the work-\nforce to focus on more complicated tasks,\nkeeping them happy and safe. Pulling people\nout of these jobs will dramatically lower insur-\nance costs. Employees who sit in an office have\na lower insurance cost for a reason—they are\nsubstantially less likely to get hurt and need\ncare or rehabilitation.\nAutomation will meaningfully impact liability,\nworkers’ compensation, and property premiums\nand risks.\nInsurance companies should determine how\nto promote automation. Increased automation\ncould meaningfully impact liability and workers’\ncompensation market premium opportunities as\nfewer employees are placed in more dangerous\npositions. Installing more machinery may offset\nthose changes by raising property risks.\nBusinesses should weigh the change in expense\nstructures that will come with automation.\nCompanies will more than likely see a savings\non premiums and insurers will save on claims\nDespite some of the headwinds against mo-\nbility, robotics, and drones, the major break-\nthroughs that these markets promise feel like\nthey are more of a matter of when versus if.\nElectrification will take hold over the next 10\nyears, with autonomy not far behind. Substan-\ntial automation will be driven by the widespread\nadoption of robots and drones with their auton-\nomous capabilities growing daily. With these\nchanges coming, organizations should have\nplans in place to take advantage of or defend\nagainst the coming changes. Impacts are com-\ning for all businesses regardless of their direct\nor tangential connection to mobility or machin-\nery. Most companies should prepare for:\n• Capturing and operationalizing data from\nvehicles, robots, and drones.\n• Finding opportunities to enable automation in\ntheir operations.\n• Knowing how insurance will be meaningfully\nimpacted by automation.\n• Understanding how mobile spaces are and\ncould be used differently.\n• Learning the impacts of electrification.\nAll businesses and governments need to absorb\nincreasing volumes of data, as well as capabili-\nties to analyze and utilize the data.\nThere are opportunities to capture revenues\nfrom the data generated by a fleet, robots, or\ndrones. This information can assess the health\nand efficiency of an operation, suggesting cor-\nrections to save on the bottom line, but also to\nmine insights and sell this information to other\ncompanies. Would an insurance carrier like\nto know how robots are performing and how\nfrequently they are down? Would they like to\nknow how accident rates have fallen? Would a\ngovernment or department of transportation like\nto know what their roads look like? Are vehicle\nroutes efficiently mapped and planned? If your\ncompany has the ability to answer these types\nof questions, you should be questioning how\nquickly you can use it.\nManufacturing, warehousing, delivery, and\nlabor-intensive businesses need to reevaluate\noperations to find opportunities for automation.\nCompanies should identify opportunities where\nrobots or drones fit their operations. Some\nworkers will be replaced, and others will need to\nbe trained to work alongside the new machines.\nHOW TO PREPARE\nWhat should your organization do now to prepare for these trends?\nMobility, Robotics & Drones\nTECH\n\n31\n© 2023 Future Today Institute\npayouts. It is far more advantageous for a busi-\nness and an insurance carrier to know exactly\nwhat the probable maximum loss is. A machine\noffers that luxury, as people are unpredictable\nand fragile.\nAutomakers, retailers, software, and entertain-\nment businesses should explore how workers\nand consumers will expect to use mobile spaces\ndifferently.\nWith dramatic shifts to vehicle architecture\nunderway, how people use their cars needs to\nbe rethought. Will a car become a third space,\nbetween home and work? An EV could some\nday become a remote workspace. The van\nlife concept—living in a vehicle, always on the\nmove—spread during the pandemic, and new\ntechnologies may encourage a new wave of\nnomadism that utilizes modern, digital comforts.\nWill this change where people live? How will\nthis impact the workforce? Employers must be\nprepared for a staff that demands remote work\noptions.\nBusinesses, governments and municipalities will\nneed to incorporate electrification and infra-\nstructure investment into their long-term (5-10\nyears) strategic plans.\nBusinesses will need to plan for the transition to\nEVs. Hard questions will need to be asked and\nan organization will need to decide how quick-\nly it will make the switch. ESG considerations\nshould not be ignored, especially as consumers\nmake the switch. They will likely demand the\nsame, if not more of the businesses they buy\nfrom.\nGovernments of all localities and sizes need to\nbegin planning for a different-looking environ-\nment that their constituents will work, reside,\nand play in.

Open banking can\nlead to open finance, which can accelerate open\ndata, and fundamentally change how scarce\nresources are distributed and allocated.\nCustomer-centric and socially responsible\napproaches are increasingly table stakes in the\ndesign of financial services products.\nIn 2023, expect increasing commoditization of\nfinancial services infrastructures.\nDuring the next 18-24 months, Decentralized\nFinance (DeFi) will mature, sparking new invest-\nment, growth, and adoption.\nFuture Today Institute expects mainstream\nfinancial services and decentralized financial\nservices to run in parallel for some time. As DeFi\ncontinues to mature, organizations will gain\nhard-fought insights around structural and cus-\ntomer protection systems. We anticipate legacy\nfinance will evolve while trying to build connec-\ntive tissue to decentralized systems, with the\nexplicit goal of absorbing enough functionality\nto avoid total disintermediation.\nLook for large nonfinancial players with signifi-\ncant centralized market power, such as platform\nproviders and regulators, to play increasingly\nactive roles in setting rules and guiding the evo-\nlution of financial services.\nAs back-office infrastructure has opened up and\nbecome standardized, banking-as-a-service\nproviders are growing increasingly popular. We\nanticipate growth in the space during the next\n24 months.\nNew forms of data modeling and credit scoring\nwill expand access to financial systems in 2023.\nResponsible innovation will be crucial to the\nfuture of alternative credit scoring, especially as\nmachine learning techniques and generative ar-\ntificial intelligence systems are applied at scale.\nFinancial Services\nINDUSTRY\n\n45\n© 2023 Future Today Institute\n3\\.

STARTUPS\n• Look to flywheel business models, and a land-\nand-expand commercialization strategy.\n• Expect securing funding will become signifi-\ncantly harder, and limit burn rates accordingly.\n• Build milestones and checkpoints into growth\nprojections, and be prepared to forego certain\nexpenses and deals if those milestones aren’t\nachieved.\n• Assume flat or down valuation funding\nrounds.\n• Get to breakeven as soon as possible.\n5\\. VC INVESTORS\n• Seek out companies with break-even strate-\ngies and healthy unit economics.\n• Prepare for internal rounds and decreasing\nvaluations.\n• Help failing companies shut down quickly, and\nwith dignity.\n6\\. RETAIL INVESTORS\n• Expect story stocks and meme stocks to re-\nvert to more standard valuations.\n• Prepare for new asset classes, like NFTs and\nfractional investments, to become a part of a\nwell-diversified portfolio.\n• Keep an eye out for financial advice from\nnon-traditional sources.\n1\\. CORPORATE INNOVATORS\n• Prepare to fast follow as waves of startups\nreach maturity and demonstrate viability of\nnew markets and business models.\n• Look to startups with new business models\nand local product market fit that seek to ex-\npand regionally or globally.\n• Build the corporate muscles to make strategic\ndecisions in uncertain environments by creat-\ning clear guidance across the organization.\n• Develop intentionality around acting, watch-\ning, or ignoring.\n2\\.

Policies\nin the West to promote a free internet largely\nfailed, leaving a fragmented digital ecosystem\nwith competing interests to grow. If there ever\nwas a truly open, global internet, it’s over.\nData from myriad sources is now viewed as a\ncomponent of geopolitical power. Country lead-\ners view data as central to competitive advan-\ntage, while tech companies rely on it to thrive\nand grow. This positions Big Tech and govern-\nment as adversaries in countries like France, the\nUS, and the UK, while China’s Big Tech compa-\nnies are reluctant bedfellows with the Chinese\nCommunist Party (CCP) leaders.\nIn 2023, the EU will finalize its AI Act, which will\nfocus on the use of AI systems that use citizen\ndata for potentially detrimental purposes. It’s\nviewed as the world’s first attempt at creating\nbroad, enforceable standards governing the use\nof AI. While AI developed for national security\nor military uses will likely be exempt from the\nEU’s new regulations, social media platforms\nlike Facebook and TikTok could find it difficult to\ncomply.\nThe global pandemic accelerated digital trans-\nformation. From newly automated city services\nto the now widespread acceptance of telehealth,\nmodernization initiatives are being deployed\nacross local, city, state/provincial, and national\ngovernments. This sets the stage for long-term\ndigital transformation of government adminis-\ntration.\nIndustrial policy has suddenly reemerged as\na tool to bolster science and technology com-\npetitiveness. After falling out of favor in the US\nduring the 1980s, there is now growing enthusi-\nasm in many countries for new policies support-\ning technology-driven industries considered\nstrategically important (such as the semicon-\nductor chip industry).\nBeijing has hundreds of basic research projects\nunderway, ranging from new quantum systems\nand supercomputers to synthetic biology and\ngenetic engineering. China has restructured\nits higher education system, positioning uni-\nversities to conduct basic research at scale. As\nthe country starts to surpass the US in govern-\nment-funded basic research, the US and other\ngovernments now see basic research as a path\nto enhance competitiveness.\nChinese companies will respond to govern-\nment calls in 2023 to share their prosperity with\nsociety through public-private partnerships\nand financial support of basic research. Ten-\ncent, China’s mega e-commerce, social media,\ngaming, and super app giant, will contribute $1.5\nbillion over 10 years to catalyze basic research in\nbiology, math, physics, and life sciences.\nIn the US, proposed bills to invest hundreds of\nbillions into technological development could\nchange the way we think about the govern-\nment’s role in value creation. Those bills include\nthe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,\n($550 billion), the Creating Helpful Incentives to\nProduce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science\nAct ($280 billion), and the Inflation Reduction\nAct ($390 billion). Collectively, they mark the\nmost aggressive funding plan for technology\nand science in a generation.\nThe United Arab Emirates hopes to become a\nneutral, global hub for emerging technology\nand policy innovation. In the coming year, look\nfor advancements in health care, autonomous\ndriving, cryptocurrencies, e-commerce, and AI.\nThe UAE has publicly stated plans to be home to\nat least 20 unicorns––startups worth $1 billion or\nmore––by the end of 2031.\nMultilateral export controls are created by\ngroups of states to informally govern the exports\nof certain technologies for mutual benefit. But\nincreasingly there is misalignment among allies,\nGovernment, Policy & Security\nINDUSTRY\n\n54\n© 2023 Future Today Institute\nGOVERNMENT, POLICY AND SECURITY TRENDS SUMMARY\nespecially when it comes to China’s semicon-\nductor industry. Such controls could backfire in\n2023.\nIn 2023, existing and proposed privacy regu-\nlations will challenge organizations, thanks to\nlocal and regional variations. Within the EU,\nsweeping frameworks like the GDPR are being\nenforced differently in member countries, while\nstringent new biometric regulations in the US\nvary from state to state. Complexity is unlikely to\nbe resolved.\nBiometric data isn’t stored as securely as it\nshould be, opening the door to theft and manip-\nulation this year.\nDuring the past three years, the risk of ransom-\nware has escalated across local governments,\nschool districts, and hospital systems. Ransom-\nware gangs are now offering their services for\nhire, and even marketing their capabilities and\ntools to outsiders. Hackers are professionalizing,\ndeveloping commercial products, and operating\nincreasingly lucrative businesses.\nCybercriminals could start targeting underwater\nIT infrastructure, including subsea cables that\nallow countries to exchange power and citizens\nto get online. Fully 95% of the world’s internet\ntraffic travels underwater at some point, making\nit difficult to protect from espionage.\nPowered by AI, lethal autonomous weapons\nsystems can find targets on their own and make\ndecisions to complete a mission.

One\nof the biggest challenges companies face\nis a lack of creativity about adversaries or\nnext-order outcomes. For example, before a\ncompany launches a new product, it should\nhost a workshop to investigate possible\nways the product could unintentionally\nbring harm to the business.\nIt’s clear that China intends to lead the\nworld in many areas of R&D, including AI,\nbiotech and synthetic biology, pharma-\nceuticals, transportation, climate change\nmitigation, and space. In recent years,\nChina launched new efforts to repatriate\nresearchers from US and European posts.\nBut tech companies are also poaching\ntalent from academic departments as well\nas other companies. With so much compe-\ntition, companies should develop strategies\nfor R&D team acquisition and retention.\nSecurity should be top of mind, but within\nmany companies, R&D units struggle to\nkeep pace with the changing technology\nlandscape. This can result in pet projects\ntaking up too much time without leading to\ndesired results—or moving without consid-\neration of security or privacy implications.\nThe cadence of R&D teams must be adjust-\ned to prioritize privacy and security.\nAs we build our new normal—working from\nanywhere, managing security breaches,\nadapting to patchwork regulation—adapt-\nability will be key to every organization’s\nability to thrive and succeed.\nBecause of globalization,\ntechnology, government,\nand security are completely\nintertwined.\nManufacturing the equipment required by\nmodern business—laptops, mobile phones,\nmachinery —relies on a supplier network\noften spanning numerous countries. The\nmeans of collecting, using, and storing data\ntypically crosses state and country lines.\nWith policy uncertainty growing and ad-\nvanced technologies creating new pressure\nfor lawmakers, it’s more important than ever\nfor executives to monitor developments\nand for government leaders to engage in\nmeaningful, long-term planning to forecast\nknock-on impacts of potential legislation.\nThe intersection of technology, policy,\nand politics affects every organization. As\nlawmakers craft new types of regulations to\naddress emerging technologies, business-\nes must address policy uncertainty in their\nstrategic planning. Anticompetitiveness\nlawsuits and antitrust investigations will\nhave a chilling effect on merger and acqui-\nsition activity by the big tech companies. If\none organization under scrutiny provides\nsome (or all) of your technology stack,\nfurther improvements and features could\nbe paused if lawsuits siphon off resources.\nLikewise, how a company collects, uses,\nand stores data; the technology acquisi-\ntions business units develop; the vendors\nand partners they select; and investments\nthey make in security all affect its future.\nThe dynamic nature of cybersecurity will di-\nrectly impact corporate strategic initiatives\nin digital transformation, operating income\ngrowth, international expansion, and more.\nPolicy uncertainty creates hurdles for\ninnovation teams, and in both the US and\nChina, the administrations have demon-\nstrated clear, decisive plans.

This\nincreasing accessibility is resulting in surprising\ncollaborations.\nNations with like-minded initiatives are setting\ntheir sights on space, resulting in the formation\nof alliances including space blocs. As more\nblocs form and space exploration continues,\nexisting treaties governing space are proving\nincreasingly obsolete.\nGeopolitical tensions are beginning to prove\nconsequential in space. China once considered\nRussia an important collaborator for future\nmoon projects and missions, but as sanctions\nresulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have\nimpeded progress, China is looking for new\nlong-term partners.\nSpace junk creates concerns not only as waste\nbut as clutter that can endanger or inhibit\nfurther development—it threatens our ability to\nleave the planet and use satellites and telecom-\nmunications devices that impact our experience\non Earth. The need for its removal provides\nrevenue opportunities for the space economy.\nEven with a reduction in the expense of send-\ning payloads—the spacebound crafts, cargo,\nor people necessary for development beyond\nEarth—costly resource production and in situ\nmanufacturing will be required for long-term\nspace missions to succeed. One example might\nbe creating oxygen from Mars’ carbon dioxide–\nrich atmosphere. Opportunities for resource ex-\ntraction and mining, as well as in situ processes\nfor harvesting materials, will drive revenues for\nthe future space economy.\nThe ability to manufacture in micro- and ze-\nro-gravity environments—areas in space with\nless gravity than Earth, or where gravity is\ncompletely absent—will become a competitive\nadvantage. Products and services that employ\nmicro- and zero-gravity dynamics, such as\norbital labs that grow stem cells, will create new\nuses.\nSpace\nINDUSTRY\n\noff the potential threats of these bad actors,\nbut little can be done proactively.\nADHERING TO COMPLIANCE AND\nREGULATORY CHANGES\nAs authorities emphasize judicious action\nregarding the use of satellites and payloads\nentering orbit, strict regulations, especially\nif enacted quickly, could disrupt operations.\nStartups with business plans relying on\nmegaconstellations for space-related ac-\ntivities and commerce could be caught off\nguard by caps on the number of satellites\nentering orbit, or by regulator restrictions\non uses.\nOPPONENTS TO SPACE-BASED INNOVATIONS\nVocal critics of space exploration and\ninnovation abound. They suggest we focus\nfirst on Earth-based challenges, rather than\nexpediting resources to impact our expe-\nrience in space. If such sentiments prove\ncontagious, they could decrease govern-\nmental interest, affecting funding opportu-\nnities for startups and rendering our space\naspirations futile.\nBEING UPENDED BY SMALL BUT MIGHTY\nPLAYERS\nSpace’s democratization should appear as\nan unbounded opportunity, but a failure by\ntraditional entities to take advantage of it\ncould result in smaller, more nimble start-\nups and organizations beating their compe-\ntition to the chase. Spending time in space\nwill require applications from industries\npresent on Earth. Organizations must act\nquickly or risk missing out on first-mover\nadvantages.\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH AND\nTRANSFORMATION\nOur analysis reveals unique opportunities\nfor organizations to unlock innovation and\ngrowth.\nDevising processes for manufacturing prod-\nucts in micro and zero gravity will result in\ncompetitive advantages.

With proper ap-\nplication, existing technologies can have\nmonumental impacts.\nFor example, mounting concerns resulting\nfrom space junk accumulation create reve-\nnue opportunities for companies centered\non cleaning up messes. Both the public\nand private sectors will have a growing,\nvested interest in keeping the orbit free\nfrom dangers associated with the detritus.\nMeanwhile, extraction of local resources\nand in situ processing will be critical to\nsurvival in space and on new planets. Orga-\nnizations that can provide necessary tools\nand solutions for mining and manufacturing\nwill benefit.

Companies\nneed to examine current training mod-\nules and invest in converting them into\nVR training modules, which could then be\nlicensed to other businesses to generate\nnew revenue.\nSMART CONTRACTS\nSmart contracts can be drawn up to de-\ntermine when certain conditions are met,\nsuch as meeting ESG goals, before they go\ninto effect. Since these contracts are stored\non a blockchain, they can provide track\nand trace solutions when data is request-\ned. Legal implications will be the first step\nto begin tackling where and when to use\nsmart contracts.\nNEARSHORING AND RE-GLOBALIZATION\nRe-globalization and nearshoring both offer\nthe prospect of stability through diversifi-\ncation. Finding the right balance between\nboth options means understanding which\nglobal conflicts in which regions pose the\nmost risk or opportunity. Monitoring these\ninitiatives over time could guide a strategy\nfor flexible manufacturing or access to new\ntalent markets.\nHUB-AND-SPOKE AUTONOMOUS MODELS\nWhen considering the last mile, human and\nautonomous options are key considerations.\nAs autonomous transportation becomes\nmore viable, there is an opportunity to re-\nstructure the human talent pool to fulfill the\nlast-mile delivery needs. This could become\na marketing strategy for employees by al-\nlowing them to work closer to home. Logis-\ntics teams need to become well-versed in\nautonomous transportation to be prepared\nfor industry changes.\nThe pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and the\nprocess of decoupling with China highlight\nvulnerabilities in the supply chain and the\nneed to prepare. Digital twin modeling can\nhelp predict such events, but acquiring the\ndata to set up the model is challenging.\nThese models should take into account\nglobal climate change disruption as well.\nLast-mile solutions are among the most\nchallenging for the logistics industry.\nConsumers have different expectations,\ndepending on the market or the specific\ngoods. Social media may help prioritize\nwhich products need to be first up on the\nlast-mile list. Manufacturers can use this\ndata to decide where to invest in micro-ful-\nfillment or additive manufacturing ware-\nhouses within the urban infrastructure.\nFuture Today Institute research suggests\nthat the future of manufacturing and the\nsupply chain will be positively influenced by\nemerging technology.

Taking risks,\nmaking unusual choices, and providing\nunique perspectives are crucial ingredients\nfor excellent storytelling, a gift not given to\neveryone—and an improbable outcome of\ncrowdsourced decisions. After the novelty\nfactor of co-authoring narratives wears off,\nwe might wake up to a landscape of medio-\ncre storytelling that is not able to provide us\nthe emotional engagement we crave.\nA NEW VALUE PROPOSITION\nThe question remains how humanity will\nrespond to content created by AI. Will\naudiences flock to digital twins of their\nfavorite celebrities? How will we relate to\nand value stories that are created by non-\nhumans? Storytelling has been used since\nthe beginning of time to share experiences\nand create connections. Will the perceived\nvalue of synthetically created content, and\nas a result the interest in and willingness to\nspend money on that content, decline?\nOPPORTUNITY SPACES\nGLOBAL STORYTELLING\nNew collaborative tools provide the oppor-\ntunity to employ a global talent pool that\nhas been trained thanks to ever-widening\naccess to digital creator tools. Such an\nabundance of diverse talent brings with\nit the opportunity for nuanced, localized\nstorytelling that deepens access to and\nunderstanding of different cultures, demo-\ngraphics, and marginalized communities by\ncreating shareable experiences.\nDEFINING NEW ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES\nAs AI takes center stage in the creation\nprocess, it shifts responsibilities for those\nwho have previously been in control: direc-\ntors, producers, designers, and artists. New\nskills need to be developed that empha-\nRISKS\nESCALATED CYBER RISKS\nIncreased digitization often brings with\nit the risk of cyberattacks. As more core\nprocesses go digital, the implications\nbecome correspondingly more severe. If a\ndigital celebrity is hacked, the damage to\nthe brand can forever hamper its earning\npotential. As AI molds storylines to personal\ntastes, attacks can influence that experi-\nence and turn it into a harmful or traumatic\nexperience for the viewer, whether the\nepisode occurs on a streaming platform or\nin a theme park. When technology evolves,\nit is crucial to build and evolve security at\nthe same time.\nDIGITAL ABUNDANCE\nA downside of digitization is its ease of rep-\nlication and the potential for overexposure\nof the market to a particular asset. A large\npart of the value proposition of entertain-\nment is the rarity and exceptionalism of its\ntalent—there is only one Mindy Kaling or\none Kathryn Bigelow.

This shift will also change the\npower dynamics of an industry traditional-\nly driven by the idiosyncratic visions of its\nmost successful creative talents. Whoever\nis able to define the new paradigm and set\nup corresponding processes and business\nmodels will set the bar for the rest of the\nindustry to follow.\nDECONSTRUCTED NARRATIVES CREATE\nNEW INCOME STREAMS\nAs storytelling evolves from finite, linear\nproducts to responsive environments that\nare customizable by the audience, every\nstory has the potential to turn into a fran-\nchise with long-lasting earning potential.\nDeconstructed narratives free up collabora-\ntive iteration between the audience and the\noriginator of the idea, and provides a canvas\nfor exploration.

These would be\nlimited primarily by the capabilities of the\ntools creating the experiences—for in-\nstance, the ability for AR and VR systems to\nprovide real-time responsiveness, or of AI to\nreassemble and customize content accord-\ning to a viewer’s profile. Beyond that, the\nbiggest limitation will be the entertainment\nindustry’s own ability to produce enough\nmodular content to customize.\n69\n© 2023 Future Today Institute\nEntertainment\nINDUSTRY\nHOW TO PREPARE\nWhat should your organization do now to prepare for these trends?\n\n70\n© 2023 Future Today Institute\nHow can you\nensure the safety\nof future digital\nassets?

Discovered on Arena.](https://i.imgur.com/sKeRQby.gif)\n\nDesigned by Maxim Leyzerovich. Discovered on Arena.\n\nCentral to FWB’s mission is equipping cultural creators and maintainers with the community and the Web3 tools they need to gain agency over their production.\n\nNavigating the relationship between branching off to form individual subcultures and re-converging to aggregate knowledge will be instrumental to our community’s success and only further motivated by the underlying coordination that the $FWB token provides.\n\nHere are some ways we will be promoting this divergence and convergence over Season Five.\n\n## Social Software: FWB Directory\n\nThe strength of our community will be defined by the strength of our one-to-one relationships. As it currently stands, though, there’s no easy way for members to find and connect with one another.\n\nDiscord is not enough for our community and there’s too much noise on Twitter.\n\n**It’s time to start building our own social spaces.**\n\nThe FWB Directory will serve as a traversable on-chain identity that enables our members to connect, grow, and move fluidly across the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nMembers will be able to search and engage with other members based on shared communities, indexed skills, and past IRL events they’ve attended.\n\n![FWB Directory](https://i.imgur.com/vwsIKKa.gif)\n\nFWB Directory\n\nAt the heart of the FWB Directory is your ID, a unique non-transferable NFT that is minted upon your membership initiation.\n\nYour NFT will contain your personalized metadata, dynamically evolve over time based on your on-chain patterns, and be fully customizable with stamps and stickers that you earn along the way.\n\nTraits will include:\n\n- Ecosystem Contributions (Interactions with Mirror, Sound, Catalog, Zora, Foundation, and more)\n- FWB Event Attendance\n- Discord Activity and Engagement\n- DAO Contribution and Roles\n- Governance Voting History\n- NFTs and Tokens Held\n- Shared Communities\n\nYour ID will be your passport as you navigate throughout the Web3 ecosystem, and the Directory will be our FWB hub within it.\n\nGlobal Members (75 $FWB) will have early beta access to the Directory.\n\n![FWB Situation Map (2022) – Illustrations by Fiona Carty](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e9OiGYAkIHR6Ta0OlUasE.jpeg)\n\nFWB Situation Map (2022) – Illustrations by Fiona Carty\n\n## Progressively Decentralized Events\n\nFWB has quickly established itself as a leader in the IRL events space.\n\nFrom token-enabled concerts to intimate dinners in your neighborhood, FWB has developed a top level guide for establishing a vibe.\n\n![FWB.LA Dinner, November 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wO5_dXd1u-fNgfyQgvIXP.png)\n\nFWB.LA Dinner, November 2021\n\nStarting Season 5, we will diverge this Playbook for Gathering to other FWB Cities, inviting community members from Berlin to San Francisco to reinterpret and throw FWB events of their own, and earn $FWB for doing so – all within the FWB ecosystem.\n\nDream up an event concept, secure an Event Key, attach a desired token-gate amount, promote through the FWB Event portal, use Gatekeeper to run check-in at the door, and accrue on-chain achievements to your FWB ID.\n\n## Governance\n\nAs FWB grows, so will the ways in which we communicate and govern ourselves.\n\n### Town Hall\n\nTown Halls have become a staple of the FWB community but with the number of active and ongoing initiatives, it’s time to upgrade our format.\n\nTown Halls will transition to [Monthly](https://www.fwb.help/events/FWB-Town-Hall011222), at a more favorable timezone, and with a new format that involves team-driven presentations.\n\nThis promotes a tighter feedback loop between Members and Contributors, ensuring that we are in alignment with our community.\n\n### Proposal Support Team\n\nA team focused on bringing proposals to life, and implementing them once passed.\n\nThis committee does not have the ability to approve or deny proposals, but exists to help support and refine the formation of proposals that, if they are robust enough, will move to a Snapshot vote.\n\nLed by Thom Mackey and Emerson Kirk.\n\n### Upvote\n\nSynchronous Discord conversations have not proven to be the best format for complex governance discussions.\n\nUpvote is a homegrown tool that will allow for threading, phasing, and more effective asynchronous discourse to take place before proposals are taken to Snapshot.\n\n![Upvote, FWB's homegrown governance product](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eNcoZNm7_hmxqGf9DwOIP.png)\n\nUpvote, FWB's homegrown governance product\n\nThis ensures the right proposals rise to the top and receive proper attention while giving contributors a better way to facilitate and integrate feedback for the most optimal outcome(s).\n\n### Bird Signal\n\nStaying in the loop on major DAO proposals has always been a challenge.\n\nWith Bird Signal, FWB members can opt in to text messages that notify you of new governance proposals.\n\nWe believe that expanding communications out of Discord will directly lead to an increase in voter turnout, and to a higher degree of quality conversation and synchronicity.\n\n### Voting\n\nBinary voting options have their limitations.\n\nFWB will implement new voting mechanics over Season 5 to allow for more nuanced decision-making, such as on-chain Discord poll votes.\n\nAs the scope of what’s meant to be voted on expands, so too will the ways community members can signal their voting power across many potential outcomes, rather than simply voting yes or no.\n\n## Onwards\n\nPeople’s first interactions with FWB are no longer exclusively digital.\n\nThe world reopened midway through FWB’s lifespan, and more friends are finding out about us through in-person experiences than Twitter timelines.\n\nThis responsibility to create cultural and technical tools that improve the creative class’ introduction to Web3 remains top of mind, and we understand the role we play in this ecosystem as a representative voice in advocating for ways in which things can be done differently.\n\nAs FWB enters its second year, we are eternally grateful to the community, which has consistently challenged us to think differently and act boldly.\n\nWith love,\n\nAlex Zhang + FWB Contributors\n\n_This past Season would not have been possible without the tireless and creative leadership from countless contributors._\n\n_Dexter Tortoriello, Mike Bodge,

In addition to building a product that people want, they also need to consider how that product can successfully run in a decentralized manner — that is, as a protocol owned and operated by a community of users.\n\nNotice that the emphasis here is very much on building a product that people want; community is a secondary objective. This emphasis is mirrored a little further down:\n\n> The earliest stage of building a crypto application requires all the ingredients of a normal startup: a great team, lean development, tight execution, and quick learning. **During this phase, the only thing that matters is product/market fit.**\n\nIt’s also reflected in the ordering of “The Three Components of Crypto Success”:\n\n> 1. Product/market fit\n>\n> 2. Community participation\n>\n> 3. Sufficient decentralization (community ownership)\n\nMy thesis is that some DAOs may be better off with the following permutation:\n\n> 1. **Fiercely loyal community**\n>\n> 2. Sufficient decentralisation (community ownership)\n>\n> 3. Product/market fit\n\nWhere the distinction between 1 and 2 is blurry at best, and 3 emerges organically from the community itself (where the community, in a sense, plays the role of both customer and co-designer).\n\n* * *\n\nWhy do I believe this?\n\nTo elaborate a little here, I see a relationship between the rising march of DAOs and the increasing complexity of the world. In particular, **the increasing gap between the complexity of the demands placed upon collective human systems and the ability of any one individual to fully understand them** – I think that deep-down, many of us intuitively feel this is true, even if we would be hard pressed to articulate it in this way.\n\nMy thoughts on this matter have been greatly influenced by the writings of the complexity theorist Yaneer Bar-Yam, who explores the relationship between complexity and human organisation in some depth in his paper – [Complexity rising: From human beings to human civilization, a complexity profile](https://necsi.edu/complexity-rising-from-human-beings-to-human-civilization-a-complexity-profile).\n\nTo quote just two passages:\n\n> **The complexity of demands upon collective human systems have recently become larger than an individual human being…**\n>\n> The implication of the disappearance or dramatic changes in centrally controlled human organizations is that **the behaviors of collections of human beings do not simplify sufficiently to be controlled by individuals**. Instead of progressive simplification from an individual to larger and larger collections of individuals, we have the opposite, an increasing complexity that is tied to an increasing complexity of the demands of the environment. **This makes it impossible for an individual to effectively control collective behaviors**.\n\nTo borrow some thoughts from his related essay – [Teams: a manifesto](https://necsi.edu/teams-a-manifesto) – I think it follows that:\n\n> **We are at the beginnings of a metamorphosis of social organization in which leadership no longer serves the role it has over millennia**…\n>\n> We need to **shift the ego’s focus from autonomy, to pride in collectivity**…\n>\n> This is the **next stage of social evolution** and there is much we need to learn and do to achieve it.\n\nLinking these thoughts back to DAOs, I suspect we are now living in an age where decentralised internet communities that figure out how to organise themselves as an interdependent complex collective of diverse individuals will end up converging on better decisions. This _is_ the next stage of social evolution. And as a consequence, these sorts of orgs will have a better chance of not only surviving, but prospering over the coming decades.\n\nAs such, my thesis is that a fiercely loyal community (more on this below) coupled with effective governance (more on what this means in a follow-up post) should lead to product/market fit emerging organically from within the community (in the style of [Grothendieck’s rising sea theorem](https://www.landsburg.com/grothendieck/mclarty1.pdf)) . And that, **in a world which has now crossed a certain complexity threshold, this is perhaps the most effective way for a DAO to prosper** / continue innovating / sustainably [find product/market fit](https://a16z.com/2019/12/09/product-zeitgeist-fit/).\n\nWithin this context, I believe the progressive decentralisation playbook misses the forest for the trees:\n\n> Community participation and decentralized control are less applicable to traditional startups, but are crucial for crypto startups. Why are they so important?\n>\n> The answer is that **community participation and control results in limited platform risk** — the risk that the rules of a platform will change against the will of its users.\n>\n> … Another important reason for achieving decentralized community control is **regulatory compliance.**\n\nThese reasons, although relevant, are of secondary importance. The primary hope is that self-organising communities will lead to a better and fairer world (through better decision making and fairer value sharing).\n\n### **The future of design is community-based**\n\nAt this stage I think it’s worth offering some thoughts on the future of design.\n\nIn a sense, the best design thinkers are already intuitively feeling and expressing what Yaneer Bar-Yam has described mathematically.\n\nFor instance, Don Norman has done a good job at explaining why he believes the future of design is community-based. In [a 2020 post outlining his vision](https://jnd.org/community-based-human-centered-design/), he expressed the following thought:\n\n> We propose a radical change in design from experts designing for people to people designing for themselves. In the traditional approach, experts study, design, and implement solutions for the people of the world. Instead, **we propose that we leverage the creativity within the communities of the world to solve their own problems: This is community-driven design**, taking full advantage of the fact that it is the people in communities who best understand their problems and the impediments and affordances that impede and support change.\n\nOne of the influences he cites is Jeremy Myerson’s wonderfully insightful paper – [Scaling Down: Why Designers Need to Reverse Their Thinking](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405872617300552).\n\nTo quote directly from the paper, the first principle of scaling down is:\n\n> 1. **Cultivate a Participatory Mindset—Not an Expert One**\n>\n>    Designers can no longer be “experts” who use design as a kind of proxy to make crucial decisions about form and function for the faceless masses. Scaling down requires a participatory mindset, **which means creating with people rather than for them.** Collaborative methods such as co-design, co-creation, and experience prototyping, for example, entail investigating and responding to real needs identified through an interactive, democratic process, and make certain design methods obsolete.\n\nAll this stands in stark contrast to the advice given in the playbook:[1](https://gardens.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-pitfalls-of-progressive#footnote-1-35195151)\n\n> To move fast toward finding it \\[product/market fit\\], it’s **important to avoid design by committee (or community!**… At this stage, **there should be no pretense of decentralization** — a core team is driving all product decisions by necessity, in the interest of finding product/market fit.\n\n### **Economic incentives are not enough**\n\nPerhaps the most serious drawback with this strategy though is that **you handicap yourself from building a fiercely loyal community from the outset**. One underappreciated consequence of this is that you may find it hard to rely on community as a moat[2](https://gardens.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-pitfalls-of-progressive#footnote-2-35195151) when you relinquish control.\n\n> For the core team, relinquishing control comes with an opportunity to begin transferring responsibility to the community. But as you go about engaging community members, it’s important to revisit incentives. _Why will community members contribute to the product on an ongoing basis?_\n\nIf you’ve focused on community first, you clearly don’t need to ask this question :)\n\nThe playbook goes on to list incentives (including token distribution) as the primary mechanism by which to motivate community contributions. And mentions Uniswap as an example of a crypto app that’s protected by the power of its network effects.\n\n> An economic incentive is one way to engender community contribution…\n>\n> Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, is an example of how a crypto application with a fee can be protected by the power of its network effects.\n\nWith hindsight, this is perhaps not the best example. As we saw last year, Sushiswap was able to successfully fork Uniswap; at some point, I think most of us felt like it even had a fair chance of eating it for lunch!\n\nSo why was this attack easier than almost anyone suspected?\n\n[![Twitter avatar for @SBF_Alameda](https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/SBF_Alameda.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nSBF @SBF\\_Alameda\\\\\n\\\\\n2) In the end, it wasn't inevitable.\\\\\n\\\\\nIf Nomi hadn't fucked up, maybe SUSHI would be at $100.\\\\\n\\\\\nIf the team hadn't built, maybe it would be at $1.\\\\\n\\\\\nBut it had a shot, because much of what we thought was sacred was in fact chasing yield.](https://twitter.com/SBF_Alameda/status/1368765737364430849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [3:29 AM ∙ Mar 8, 2021\\\\\n\\\\\n* * *\\\\\n\\\\\n93Likes7Retweets](https://twitter.com/SBF_Alameda/status/1368765737364430849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nI think a key lesson here is that economic incentives cannot, by themselves, sustain a community (because the next guy can always come along and offer more). Put another way, although they are perhaps necessary (though even this is [arguable](https://hackmd.io/iInz8_sGQba2Cw4JG1N1CQ?view)), they are not sufficient.\n\n[![Twitter avatar for @dazuck](https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/dazuck.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nDanny Zuckerman (hiring) @dazuck\\\\\n\\\\\nThe key (I think): the community must remain stronger than the economic rewards.

For those who would counter that Uniswap has a large community, I think it’s worth stating here that there isn’t necessarily a correlation between size of community and strength of loyalty (more on this in a follow-up post).\n\n[![Twitter avatar for @jchervinsky](https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/jchervinsky.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nJake Chervinsky @jchervinsky\\\\\n\\\\\n9/ So, if you're asking \"how will Uniswap enforce against an anon dev team or a decentralized protocol,\" you have the wrong question.\\\\\n\\\\\nThe value of the BSL 1.1 license isn't just to stop forks from being launched, it's to stop forks from becoming widely adopted & successful.](https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1374738563091345410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [3:03 PM ∙ Mar 24, 2021\\\\\n\\\\\n* * *\\\\\n\\\\\n29Likes1Retweet](https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1374738563091345410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThe sad truth is that, **in the absence of a strong and loyal community, you’re left clutching at copyright as a moat.**\n\n## **Community as a superpower**\n\n[![Twitter avatar for @pet3rpan_](https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/pet3rpan_.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\npet3rpan @pet3rpan\\_\\\\\n\\\\\n@jessewldn Community development is the new super power](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1215403040494063616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [10:40 PM ∙ Jan 9, 2020\\\\\n\\\\\n* * *\\\\\n\\\\\n13Likes1Retweet](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1215403040494063616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nI’ll ground my thoughts here in two essays by Luke Duncan that have particularly marked me. My thoughts on this subject are not particularly original. In fact, nearly all of them are borrowed from Luke.\n\nLuke is one of the deepest thinkers in this space, and has been thinking and writing about the importance of communities in crypto for several years now.\n\nIn his 2018 essay on [Community aggregation theory](https://blog.aragon.one/community-aggregation-theory-973a283c7226/), Luke explains why he believes **community and governance are where value will accrue over the long-term**:\n\n> With an established and loyal community, any protocol that is running inefficiently can be forked in order to create net value for the community.\n>\n> … That is the power of a strong and fiercely loyal community, and why I suspect value will tend to accrue primarily in the currency-governance layer rather than in any other protocol layer.\n>\n> By combining the currency use case with governance, communities will have a huge advantage in effectively aggregating the economic activity of the ecosystems that develop within and around them.[4](https://gardens.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-pitfalls-of-progressive#footnote-4-35195151)\n\nThese thoughts build on an earlier essay of his titled [Thoughts On Governance and Network Effects](https://blog.aragon.one/thoughts-on-governance-and-network-effects-f40fda3e3f98/), in which he makes the case that, when it comes to optimising for loyalty, **the most important thing is to maximise Voice of network participants**:\n\n> … having a defensible token model is not sufficient to maintain a strong network effect. Token balances can be copied by competitors, software and datasets can be forked, **how do you ensure that your token holders are loyal and will continue to prefer your service over that of competitors?**\n>\n> … if we acknowledge that the biggest barrier to a fork is the desire to maintain a network effect, than we come to the conclusion that **we must maximize Voice of network participants.**\n\nIn a sentence, if you’re able to maximise voice, you’re able to maximise loyalty, and that is the strongest combination of offense + defence you can ask for.\n\nI don’t have much to add to these two essays, so if you haven’t done so already, please read (and re-read) them!\n\n## **In summary**\n\nAlthough the progressive decentralisation strategy can work well in some cases, it has its pitfalls.\n\nIn particular, focusing on product/market fit before community may handicap you from building a fiercely loyal community, even once you have “exited” to it. An underappreciated consequence of this is that you may be forced to rely on copyright as a moat in order to continue accruing value.\n\nOne way to avoid this is to place at least as much importance on community as on product _from the outset_ (and probably, considerably more).\n\nThe key to a fiercely loyal community is a shared sense of purpose (values and mission), and a culture in which participants feel they have a strong voice (the earlier and the more intensely they feel this, the more loyal they will be).\n\nGiven a fiercely loyal community, product/market fit can and will emerge organically from the community itself (where the community, in a sense, plays the role of both customer and co-designer).\n\nFurther, in a world which has now crossed a certain complexity threshold, thinking of community as co-designer is perhaps the most effective way for a DAO to prosper and continue innovating over the long-term.\n\n## **Final thoughts**\n\nOne question we haven’t addressed here is how to go about maximising voice. Once again, Luke has some sound advice:\n\n> The best way to maximize voice is through effective governance.\n\nClearly this is much easier said than done. What does effective governance even mean? This is a very interesting and much longer discussion; one which I promise to address in a follow-up post.\n\nBear in mind these aren’t just theoretical arguments being put forward. This philosophy is being [put to the test](https://forum.1hive.org/t/thoughts-on-the-honey-price/1146) as part of a community Luke has founded called [1hive](https://forum.1hive.org/t/together-we-thrive/1278).[5](https://gardens.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-pitfalls-of-progressive#footnote-5-35195151)\n\nIf it succeeds, I suspect it will result in an important step change to our collective thinking – on the same order of magnitude as both Bitcoin and Ethereum. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that 1hive has the potential to expand the scope of what most of us believe to be possible, and shape the future of human organisation for decades to come.\n\n* * *\n\n_**Thanks** to Jessica Steiner, Gabi Garcia, Luke Duncan, Aude Launay, Tom Saint-Leger, Barnabé Monnot, and Louis ( [@albiverse](https://twitter.com/albiverse)) for reading drafts of this._\n\n.\n\n[1](https://gardens.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-pitfalls-of-progressive#footnote-anchor-1-35195151)\n\nAs a side note, I think it’s also worth noting that when dealing with large complex, sociotechnical systems – which the most successful crypto applications will probably have an impact on – Don Norman highlights the importance of _moving slowly._\n\n> Designs must confront several major complexities when applied to the large, complex, needs of the world. These complexities are of special importance to the application of Human-Centered Design. Three areas are of special note:\n>\n> 1. **Large complex, sociotechnical systems.** When major political, economic, social and cultural variables interact, **it is best to proceed slowly, with incremental, opportunistic steps** (See Norman & Stappers, 2016).\n>\n>    _Community based Human centered design_,\n\n[2](https://gardens.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-pitfalls-of-progressive#footnote-anchor-2-35195151)\n\nIn fact the term “moat” is really underselling it here. As Barnabé Monnot has pointed out to me, community is much more than a moat. A moat is a passive line of defence. But a loyal community is far more active than that; it can contribute to improving the structure of the castle itself, and play offense too.\n\n[3](https://gardens.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-pitfalls-of-progressive#footnote-anchor-3-35195151)\n\nDecentralized autonomous organizations are closer to a complex dynamic system than a company. As such, the initial conditions of that system have a profound effect on the result (yet another idea I’ve borrowed from Luke :)\n\n[4](https://gardens.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-pitfalls-of-progressive#footnote-anchor-4-35195151)\n\nRegarding product/market fit emerging organically from the community itself, Luke writes:\n\n> If a community desires, governance can be used to socialize the cost of provisioning public goods through inflation or transaction fees, including the systematic forking of “thin” protocols that have grown too “fat”, funding the creation of novel protocols which commoditize new markets, or building applications and tools which further enhance the utility of the community’s currency\n\n[5](https://gardens.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-pitfalls-of-progressive#footnote-anchor-5-35195151)\n\nA short extract from the [1hive wiki](https://wiki.1hive.org/) (to give you a flavour of just how special the culture is):\n\n> 1Hive isn’t a company, there is no core team, and there has never been a crowd sale to raise funds to operate. Instead 1Hive has been issuing and distributing [Honey](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/honey) to contributors for over a year. Up until recently it didn’t have a market defined price but it eventually found its way onto an exchange and now it does. The community doesn’t need Honey to have a certain price in order to distribute it, but as it becomes more valuable, the community is able to direct more resources towards community projects, and in turn those projects may grow the Honey economy further.\n>\n> By optimizing how we issue and distribute Honey we hope to create a future that is more free, fair, open, and humane.\n\n* * *\n\n#### Subscribe to Gardens\n\nBy sacha · Launched 5 years ago\n\nthoughts from the frontier\n\nSubscribe\n\nBy subscribing, I agree to Substack's [Terms of Use](https://substack.com/tos), and acknowledge its [Information Collection Notice](https://substack.com/ccpa#personal-data-collected) and [Privacy Policy](https://substack.com/privacy).\n\n14\n\n3\n\nShare\n\n#### Discussion about this post\n\nCommentsRestacks\n\n![User's avatar](https://gardens.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png)\n\n[![Joshua Tan's avatar](https://gardens.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05d3bf15-5c52-42f7-9754-12cb6ed496fc_1645x2098.jpeg)](https://substack.com/profile/1104321-joshua-tan?utm_source=comment)\n\n[Joshua Tan](https://substack.com/profile/1104321-joshua-tan?utm_source=substack-feed-item)\n\n[Nov 24, 2021](https://gardens.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-pitfalls-of-progressive/comment/3751697 \"Nov 24, 2021, 7:12 PM\")\n\nWait, a ref. to Grothendieck's rising sea?

Let Gas Killer handle the efficiency.\n\n#### Skip Gas Auditing\n\nNo more expensive gas audits or complex optimizations. Deploy with confidence knowing Gas Killer handles efficiency.\n\n#### Unlimited Array Operations\n\nProcess arrays of any length without gas limits. Perfect for batch operations and complex data processing.\n\n### Demonstrated Gas Savings\n\n99%\n\nGas Reduction\n\nwith 3000 voters\n\n97%\n\nGas Reduction\n\nwith 1000 voters\n\n81%\n\nGas Reduction\n\nwith 100 voters\n\nGas savings increase with computational complexity, making Gas Killer ideal for data-intensive operations\n\n### Write Smart Contracts, Naturally\n\nTraditional Approach\n\n```\n// Complex gas optimization\nfunction vote(uint256[] calldata ids)\n  external {\n  require(ids.length <= 10,\n    \"Too many votes\");\n  for (uint i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {\n    // Limited by gas\n    _processVote(ids[i]);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n❌ Limited by gas constraints\n\nWith Gas Killer\n\n```\n// Infinite computation? No problem!\nfunction compute() external {\n  // Works perfectly fine\n  while (true) {\n    _process();\n    _updateState();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n✅ Processes off-chain efficiently\n\n## Community Driven Development\n\nJoin a growing ecosystem of developers and users building a more efficient and sustainable blockchain future. Gas Killer is developed by the community, for the community.\n\n![Futuristic scene with bread and technology](https://hebbkx1anhila5yf.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Screenshot%202025-03-01%20at%2021.52.53-bP65U6u9bgK0uiGKstBBmvb2OyfhiE.png)\n\n## Gas Savings\n\nThe optimized approach demonstrates substantial gas savings that scale with complexity.\n\n### Demonstrated Savings\n\n- 99%With 3000 voters: ~99% gas reduction\n- 97%With 1000 voters: ~97% gas reduction\n- 81%With 100 voters: ~81% gas reduction\n- 63%With 40 voters: ~63% gas reduction\n- 38%With 15 voters: ~38% gas reduction\n\nAs the number of voters increases, the gas savings become more pronounced, making this approach highly scalable for applications with large data sets.\n\nGas Reduction vs. Number of VotersGas Reduction (%)020406080100Number of Voters154010010003000\n\n## Watch Gas Killer in Action\n\nSee how Gas Killer is revolutionizing smart contract development at ETHDenver.\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/LQMCS8eV3GI?start=879)",

I’m moving into a whole new economy — on the blockchain.\n\n“Web3” decentralizes and transforms the web. If the first version of the web was for exchanging _information_, and the second _interactions_, then this third wave is for exchanging _value_. I’ve been involved in the first two waves, and this third one is the most exciting.\n\nWeb3 holds the seeds for a new kind of work. It enables coordination on previously unimaginable scales, but this time without centralized control. Web3 will also help us tackle our greatest challenges, but only if we choose to use it that way.\n\nIt’s this excitement about Web3 that motivated me to resuscitate this old Medium account as a place to share my experiences and observations about venturing into what many now call the “Web3 rabbit hole.”\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*k7s0IqzWrYCdRZZwwJHRSA.jpeg)\n\n## Down the Rabbit Hole\n\nMy first encounter with Web3 was in 2017 when I interviewed [Jack du Rose](https://twitter.com/jackdurose) about his work on Colony. I remember feeling at the time as though I were talking with someone from the future. That same year, I also consulted for a startup working a blockchain-based social network. The project didn’t pan out, but it did give me firsthand experience working in this new world.\n\nNot long after that, I found myself developing some new ideas for large-scale socio-economic change. After banging around for a while, I eventually realized that what I was envisioning was really only possible with the blockchain. With that epiphany, I re-centered my work around Web3.\n\nGoing forward, most of my time will still focus on research and writing, but now with a focus on Web3. To ground that work with hands-on experience, I decided it was important to get involved with the new breed of Web3 organizations known as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).\n\nI spent many hours over the last few months diving into Discord servers and Discourse forums, reading documents, tweets, and pretty much anything I could get my hands on. That exploration exposed me to some remarkable organizations, including [The Commons Stack](https://commonsstack.org/index), [Giveth](https://giveth.io/), [ixo](https://www.ixo.world/), [Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/), and [Moonshot Collective](https://moonshotcollective.space/). The flood of information proved overwhelming, however, and by October I decided to focus my energy on just one DAO.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:400/1*hZHw0NEbNDUiC0IFAeEHgQ.png)\n\n(Me tweeting about my DAO research process.)\n\nThat DAO is the [**Token Engineering Commons**](https://tecommons.org/).\n\n## “Token Engineering”\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:180/1*YMBYfHC5WRd5ONeRAASaJA.png)\n\n**T** oken **E** ngineering **C** ommons\n\nThe Token Engineering Commons (TEC) is a DAO that focuses on…yep, you guessed it,… _token engineering_. Some of my current readers may not yet understand what that means. I hope to help you change that over time. For now, let’s just say that token engineering is how we will design our economies in the future. Building this new field of expertise is the TEC mission.\n\n## Get Gideonro’s stories in your inbox\n\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from this writer.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe\n\nWhat I most appreciate about the TEC community is its simultaneous commitment to both the technical _and_ cultural aspects of token engineering. It is a highly technical organization but it is also deeply human. As we build the foundation for what comes next, the cold logic of automated supply and demand curves needs to be wrapped in the [warmth of the human soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoKTdQsbiL4).\n\nSo that’s the _“token engineering”_ aspect, but what about the “ _commons”_ part of the TEC name?\n\n## It’s Commons Sense\n\nA commons is a resource whose sustainability is a shared interest for many. Examples include things like the atmosphere, the English language, a technology protocol like Ethereum, or a field of knowledge — like token engineering.\n\nMainstream economic theory says that the commons is not something we can have. It views avarice as insurmountable, and assumes that shared resources will always be gobbled up by individuals operating in their own self-interest. The “ [tragedyof the commons](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tragedy_of_the_commons)” is seen as inevitable.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:300/1*JYj3HQd0maTCqAgVRxDSqw.jpeg)\n\nElinor Ostrum’s classic, [Governing the Commons](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Governing_the_Commons).\n\n[Elinor Ostrum](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Elinor_Ostrom) disproved this view with painstaking research that outlines a set of governance practices for building a thriving and sustainable commons. I’ve been delighted to see that Ostrum’s ideas have found a new home on the blockchain. Yes, the Bitcoin community has a strong libertarian streak, but the divide between free market and community values seems a bit more fuzzy in this new world. Freedom is sacrosanct. But there’s also a sense that most of society’s problems boil down to _coordination failures_.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*_TqRkcJbqwsnrVAriaDCwQ.jpeg)\n\n“It’s all [coordination](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1397613506720059393).”\n\nWeb3 is governance technology that looks and feels a lot like coordination technology. We are seeing the birth of a movement that will use these new governance tools to transform our response to humanity’s greatest challenges. We face many problems, but one of the greatest unknowns centers on our relationship with rapidly accelerating machine intelligence. Web3 won’t just be our best bet for governing ourselves — it will also be the key to governing our machines. But more on that in future posts…\n\nI can think of no better place to invest my time, money, and energy than a DAO that is creating a commons around this new field of governance. That’s why I have chosen the TEC as my portal into Web3.\n\n## Welcome to the Rabbit Hole\n\nThis post marks my foray into writing about Web3. I will publish in other places, but I am dedicating this space on Medium to sharing what I learn as I venture down this Web3 rabbit hole.\n\nMy hope is that these forthcoming observations will appeal to two groups. The first is newcomers who find themselves getting “curiouser and curiouser” about this new world. The second is the existing Web3 community. For you, my hope is to reflect upon the marvel of what you are doing and help frame it in terms of what the world so desperately needs from you right now.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*MAdn2pOJfZ9Af6P6sE1m3w.png)\n\nFollow the White Rabbit\n\nP.S. for anyone who would like to know more about TEC, feel free to [drop me a note on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gideonro).\n\n[Web3](https://medium.com/tag/web3?source=post_page-----7870814f06ef---------------------------------------)\n\n[Future Of Work](https://medium.com/tag/future-of-work?source=post_page-----7870814f06ef---------------------------------------)\n\n[Blockchain](https://medium.com/tag/blockchain?source=post_page-----7870814f06ef---------------------------------------)\n\n[Governance](https://medium.com/tag/governance?source=post_page-----7870814f06ef---------------------------------------)\n\n[Guest Blog](https://medium.com/tag/guest-blog?source=post_page-----7870814f06ef---------------------------------------)\n\n[Some rights reserved](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\n\n[![Gideonro](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*iq_ubyCMpMZ1bqEvyAauHQ.jpeg)](https://gideonro.medium.com/?source=post_page---post_author_info--7870814f06ef---------------------------------------)\n\n[![Gideonro](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*iq_ubyCMpMZ1bqEvyAauHQ.jpeg)](https://gideonro.medium.com/?source=post_page---post_author_info--7870814f06ef---------------------------------------)\n\nFollow\n\n[**Written by Gideonro**](https://gideonro.medium.com/?source=post_page---post_author_info--7870814f06ef---------------------------------------)\n\n[2K followers](https://gideonro.medium.com/followers?source=post_page---post_author_info--7870814f06ef---------------------------------------)\n\n· [264 following](https://gideonro.medium.com/following?source=post_page---post_author_info--7870814f06ef---------------------------------------)\n\nTechie, social entrepreneur, futurist focused on mission-driven, token-engineered, community wealth and socio-economic change.

More recently, they note, Vitalik Buterin and others in the cryptocurrency community have taken up the rhetoric of blockchain mechanisms as public goods; but, for all their “public” qualities such as open APIs, unrestricted membership and transparent allocation of resources, many of the characteristics contradict claims of public accessibility. If blockchains serve a “public” today, then it’s primarily one of decentralised finance. Fundamentally, tokenholders share only one object of concern: price.\n\nGiven that “good” is necessarily defined in relation to the value system of a given community, public goods rely on shared moral conditions. Walking through what constitutes the public, how we determine what counts as a public good, and how, in today’s world’s, capital isn’t scarce but ambitious visions for the public benefit are, Other Internet argue we must be equipped with an even more inclusive and visionary concept of what “public” and “good” can mean.\n\n[\\[ READ NOW \\]](https://otherinter.net/research/positive-sum-worlds/)\n\n### ![🏰](<Base64-Image-Removed>) History of Public Goods\n\nHow have public goods evolved over time?

As set out by the First Congress in 1790, the original term of copyright was 14 years; now it’s closer to two hundred. Jefferson considered protecting the public against overly long monopolies on creative works to be an essential government role.

The concept extends ideas from Quadratic Voting to a funding mechanism for endogenous community formation.\n\nThey propose the city as a potential test site; while urbanists have long seen the importance of community-level decision making in cities and a growing body of evidence suggests that policies emphasising community values and diversity generate major improvements in urban living, cities often lack mechanisms that allow goods valued in communities to emerge.

This revisiting notes that Hardin, in the famous example of sheep and land, blurred the ideas of resource systems (pasture) with resource governance (open access), and open access (no constraints) with commons (sharing among community members on terms they set). Between these two blurrings, he underestimated the power of commons as a form of governance.\n\nCommunities are embedded in government and market systems, as research by multiple scholars including Elinor Ostrom’s found, with her work (such as the piece below) providing insights into how and when effective commons can be implemented. In this piece, the author emphasises that understanding how communities develop and share knowledge is critical to successful governance. In the modern digital world, trust in governments and markets as sources of governance is tenuous at best; Ostrom’s commons is well suited to local communities managing resources, but we need to explore how this scales.\n\n[\\[ READ NOW \\]](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-tragedy-of-the-commons-revisited/)\n\n### [What Co-ops and DAOs can learn from each other](https://www.fwb.help/wip/what-co-ops-and-daos-can-learn-from-each-other)\n\nby [Austin Robey](https://twitter.com/austinrobey_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n\nBlog \\| Level 2\n\nThe growing platform co-operative movement (platforms designed and owned by their users) clearly have overlap in terms of ideology and intent with DAOs; both seek to expand collective ownership and governance of digital infrastructure.

Co-ops have developed toolkits to allow members to give voice and transparency, plus hold leadership accountable. 3) For DAOs with a strong social mission, the core cooperative principles offer much to inspire.\n\n[\\[ READ NOW \\]](https://www.fwb.help/wip/what-co-ops-and-daos-can-learn-from-each-other)\n\n### [Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action](https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1848&context=nrj)\n\nby Elinor Ostrom\n\nWhitepaper \\| Level 3\n\n\\*hard but literally won a Nobel\n\nOstrom argues for a third approach to resolving the challenges of the commons; the design of durable co-ooperative institutions that are organized and governed by resource users.\n\nFirst principle is clear boundaries set to identify members of the user pool as well as the physical boundaries of the CPR\n\nRules must make sense when applied\n\nAll individuals can participate in collective choice arrangements\n\nEither the appropriators or those accountable to them are responsible for monitoring compliance with collective decisions.\n\nLow cost and readily available conflict resolution mechanisms must exist to mediate conflicts among appropriators, and between appropriators and officials.\n\nUsers must have recognition of their own rights to organize institutions.\n\nNested enterprises - sets of rules established within a hierarchy of appropriator institutions - must be established for common-pool resources within larger resource systems.\n\n[\\[ READ NOW \\]](https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1848&context=nrj)\n\n### [The difference between Public Goods Problems and Coordination Problems… and whether it matters](https://s.mirror.xyz/djByMntM2rQF4tqUISYS2MAO3oCfSWoOZSOpZjsYwaw)\n\nby [Michael Zargham](https://twitter.com/mZargham), [Scott Moore](https://twitter.com/notscottmoore), and [Matt Stephenson](https://twitter.com/stephensonhmatt)\n\nBlog \\| Level 2\n\nPublic goods problems (sometimes known as the “free-rider” problem, the idea that anyone can enjoy a good once it’s been provided, therefore there is no incentive for people to pay for the good because they can consume it without paying) and coordination problems (definition: the failure to coordinate means that, despite aligned interests, the outcome is suboptimal for all) are related concepts, but this blog argues that they are fundamentally distinct.\n\nThe piece uses the example of real-world public goods problems experiments to illustrate game theory. Say all participants get $20 with an offer to either put this in the collective pot or keep, then the cash is redistributed. A few rounds in, our free riders have dramatically more cash, others are annoyed and cooperation devolves. But, in time, a certain percentage of players maintain their optimism, and this optimism is a crucial building block of a real-world solution. It’s comforting to know that earnest attempts to solve both sets of problems might be met by this optimism, this belief that we can and will get to the socially optimal solution.\n\n[\\[ READ NOW \\]](https://s.mirror.xyz/djByMntM2rQF4tqUISYS2MAO3oCfSWoOZSOpZjsYwaw)\n\n### ![🌊](<Base64-Image-Removed>) Explore Deeper\n\nWho are experts and leaders in the space you should follow?

Anyone in the world is able to see exactly which addresses signed a given transaction.\nIn many cases, this is not desirable.\n\nzkSafe allows Safe owners to collectively sign transactions, without revealing who exactly signed it. The zkSafe module only ensures that there's a proof of:\n\n1. At least threshold number of valid transactions signatures\n2. That are pairwise disinct (i.e. you can't reach threshold by including the signature twice)\n3. Each of which is done by one of the Safe's owners.\n\nOnce the module sees such a proof accompanying a Safe transaction, the module can safely execute it.\n\nCurrently, zkSafe doesn't hide the owners themselves. The whole world can still see who the Safe owners are. Only the signers of specific transactions are hidden. In the future zkSafe will also hide the list of owners.\n\n# Available Networks\n\n[Permalink: Available Networks](https://github.com/1kx-network/zksafe#available-networks)\n\nzkSafe module is deployed at the following networks:\n\n- Ethereum\n- Base\n- BSC\n- Polygon\n- Gnosis\n- Arbitrum One\n- Optimism Mainnet\n- Scroll\n- Sepolia\n\nThe contract is deployed deterministically to the following address: 0xed1Ae0946bfB84253561fB1a05fEeD120A8cD2Eb\n\nOther networks could be added, please contact us or deploy yourself and send PRs.\n\n# Audits\n\n[Permalink: Audits](https://github.com/1kx-network/zksafe#audits)\n\nAudit by Halborn: [https://www.halborn.com/audits/1kx/zk-sync-matter-labs-zk-safe-sca](https://www.halborn.com/audits/1kx/zk-sync-matter-labs-zk-safe-sca)\n\n# Usage\n\n[Permalink: Usage](https://github.com/1kx-network/zksafe#usage)\n\n## Backendless UI\n\n[Permalink: Backendless UI](https://github.com/1kx-network/zksafe#backendless-ui)\n\nThe best way to use zkSafe is via the 1kx backendless UI at [http://zksafe.1kx.io](http://zksafe.1kx.io/). The alternative UI implementation doesn't use any messaging. Therefore, coordination of signature collection is done by signers themselves via any messaging mechanism they prefer, such as [Signal](https://signal.org/).\n\nOnce a Safe owner has signed a particular transaction, they can send a URL containing this transaction to other owners. Those, in turn, after signing the transaction with their signatures, can send URLs back to the original signer, or to some other individual who will end up seeing all the necessary signatures.\n\nThe party who eventually sees all the sigatures, can click \"Generate Proof\" and a proof will generated. This proof certifies that the signatures are correctly collected as required by Safe. This proof can then later be used to execute a transaction. Anyone address can execute it, even if that address is not the owner of the Safe. This gives opportunity to delegate the final execution to services like Gelato.\n\n### Demo: enabling zkSafe module on an existing Safe\n\n[Permalink: Demo: enabling zkSafe module on an existing Safe](https://github.com/1kx-network/zksafe#demo-enabling-zksafe-module-on-an-existing-safe)\n\nzkSafe.Module.Enablement.mp4\n\n### Demo: sending a transaction in Zero Knowledge\n\n[Permalink: Demo: sending a transaction in Zero Knowledge](https://github.com/1kx-network/zksafe#demo-sending-a-transaction-in-zero-knowledge)\n\nzkSafe.Usage.mp4\n\nBecause the backendless UI is also stateless, it can only perform basic functions of Safe: sending transactions. It has a Transaction Builder and a Wallet Connect option for dapps.\n\n### Discussion of Backendless UI\n\n[Permalink: Discussion of Backendless UI](https://github.com/1kx-network/zksafe#discussion-of-backendless-ui)\n\nThe Backendless UI source code can be found at [https://github.com/1kx-network/safe-ui-lite](https://github.com/1kx-network/safe-ui-lite).\n\nBackendless.UI.mp4\n\n## Command line usage\n\n[Permalink: Command line usage](https://github.com/1kx-network/zksafe#command-line-usage)\n\nA set of Hardhat tasks are implemented for most common tasks, in case you don't want to use the UI or want to automate the usage of zkSafe.\n\n### Creating a zkSafe\n\n[Permalink: Creating a zkSafe](https://github.com/1kx-network/zksafe#creating-a-zksafe)\n\nFirst, compile the project so that the Ultraverifier Solidity code is produced:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat compile\n```\n\nOne can add the zkSafe module to any existing Safe thus enabling the option of zk singing.\n\n#### Manually adding zkSafe\n\n[Permalink: Manually adding zkSafe](https://github.com/1kx-network/zksafe#manually-adding-zksafe)\n\nSend the following transaction using Safe's Transaction Builder:\n\n```\nTo: your safe address\nValue: 0\nCalldata: 0x610b59250000000000000000000000006bcb4994265af42e73533f2565df85cdf30aaff9\n```\n\nCalldata corresponds to `enableModule(address)`. Substitute the ending hex digits with the address of the zkSafe module.\nSign this transaction with threshold number of owners and execute it it.\n\n#### Creating a new Safe with zkSafe module enabled\n\n[Permalink: Creating a new Safe with zkSafe module enabled](https://github.com/1kx-network/zksafe#creating-a-new-safe-with-zksafe-module-enabled)\n\nAlternatively one can create a Safe with the zk module enabled using the following hardhat task `createZkSafe`, for example:\n\n```\n$ npx hardhat createZkSafe --network <mainnet|gnosis|sepolia> --owners 0x0Ccb2b6675A60EC6a5c20Fb0631Be8EAF3Ba2dCD,0x48129F999598675F40A6d36Cec58a623b8c0228d,0x6804a7411adFAEB185d4dE27a04e5B6281160822 --threshold 2\ninitialized my wallet\nMy wallet address:  0x0Ccb2b6675A60EC6a5c20Fb0631Be8EAF3Ba2dCD\nzkSafeModule:  0xec2dE1dfa3C2e1435823732E7390eFcF1b1B05B1\nCreated zkSafe at address:  0xE437407d73cb2e57F0dA6Dbe822e498a4Acc1c16\n```\n\nNote the last address that the command returns - this is the address of your Safe. You can use it via the Safe UI normally, and using hardhat tasks for zk signing.\n\n### Creating a new transaction\n\n[Permalink: Creating a new transaction](https://github.com/1kx-network/zksafe#creating-a-new-transaction)\n\nZkSafe doesn't require any usual UI flow for transaction. The owners signing a transaction need to agree on the transaction parameters (to, value, calldata) offline. The reason for this is that creating a transaction in the Safe UI leaves a trace via the Safe REST API, and thus defeats the purpose of zkSafe.\n\nEach of the signing owners will produce a signature for the desired transaction, and send over the txn hash and the signature to the prover. The prover could be one of the owners, or a completely separate person/entity. Prover just needs to produce a SNARK certifying that it has seen at least a threshold of valid signatures of the owners of the Safe.\n\nHere's how one can sign a transaction with zkSafe hardhat tasks using the `sign` hardhat task:\n\n```\nnpx hardhat --network <mainnet|sepolia|gnosis|etc> sign --safe <safe address> --to <to-address> --value <to-value-in-wei> --data <calldata>\n```\n\nIt will check the chain ID, current Safe transaction nonce, etc, and generate the transaction hash and signature just as Safe would via the UI.\nThe command will output the transaction hash, and the signature. These values need to be send to the prover.\n\n### Proving the transaction\n\n[Permalink: Proving the transaction](https://github.com/1kx-network/zksafe#proving-the-transaction)\n\nHaving collected all the signatures, we need to generate a proof. This is done with the `prove` hardhat task.\n\n```\nnpx hardhat --network <mainnet|sepolia|gnosis|etc>  prove --safe <safe address>  --signatures <signature1>,<signature2>,<sinagure3> --txhash <txhash>\n```\n\nProving might take a couple of minutes, and would return a large hex string starting with 0x. This is the prove that needs to be sent to zkSafe along with the transaction.\n\nWARNING: Only up to 10 owners/signatures is supported at the moment. This limit will be increased (or completely removed) soon.\n\n### Sending a proven transaction\n\n[Permalink: Sending a proven transaction](https://github.com/1kx-network/zksafe#sending-a-proven-transaction)\n\nOnce we have the proof, we may send it. Proving and sending the transaction are separate steps, because they can be done by different entities. For instance, one can send the transaction from a relay.\nHere is how one can use the hardhat task `zksend`.\n\n```\nnpx hardhat --network  <mainnet|sepolia|gnosis|etc> zksend --safe <safe address>  --to <to-address> --value <to-value-in-wei> --data <calldata> --proof <proof hex string>\n```\n\nIf the prove is correct, the transaction will call DELEGATECALL on the Safe to bump the transaction nonce, and then execute the required transction from the module.\n\n## About\n\nzkSafe allows Safe owners to collectively sign transactions, without revealing who exactly signed it.\n\n\n[zksafe.1kx.io/](https://zksafe.1kx.io/ \"https://zksafe.1kx.io/\")\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/1kx-network/zksafe#readme-ov-file)\n\n### License\n\n[Apache-2.0 license](https://github.com/1kx-network/zksafe#Apache-2.0-1-ov-file)\n\n### Uh oh!\n\nThere was an error while loading.

Role specification is a battle tested approach to enable the seamless scaling of small DAOs into larger ones.\n- _Security._ Separated Powers allows for the creation of checks and balances between roles. The more checks and balances a DAO implements in its governance structure, the better it will be protected against hostile governance take overs.\n- _Decentralisation._ Separated Powers enables DAOs to divide their community in groups (such as builders, token holders, users) and give each groups different, restricted, governance powers. Using roles to separate powers in governance is a tried and true approach to safeguarding decentralisation of (social, political and economic) assets in light of their tendency to centralise around informal elites.\n- _Multipliers._ Above all else, Separated Powers creates multipliers between decentralisation, efficiency and security. In Separated Powers, increased decentralisation leads to more efficiency and more security. A focus on security will also increase decentralisation of DAO governance, etc.\n\n## Protocol Architecture\n\n[Permalink: Protocol Architecture](https://github.com/7Cedars/separated-powers#protocol-architecture)\n\nFor now, the protocol does not have extensive documentation. Instead, you can do the following\n\n- Watch the [**15 minute explanation**](https://github.com/7Cedars/separated-powers/blob/main/www.tella.tv/video/separated-powers-solving-dao-governance-challenges-bis6).\n- Read [`/solidity/README.md`](https://github.com/7Cedars/separated-powers/blob/main/solidity).\n- Then read through the code of `solidity/src/Powers.sol`, `solidity/src/IPowers.sol` and `solidity/src/Law.sol` and read through their code and natspecs.\n\nMore extensive documentation will be created asap.\n\n## Important files and folders\n\n[Permalink: Important files and folders](https://github.com/7Cedars/separated-powers#important-files-and-folders)\n\n```\n.\n├── frontend          # App workspace\n|    ├── README.md    # All information needed to run the dApp locally.\n│    └── ...\n│\n├── public            # Images\n|\n├── solidity          # Contains all the contracts, interfaces and tests.\n│    ├── README.md    # All information needed to run contracts locally, test and deploy contracts.

Governance principles and design notes can be found [here](https://app.clarity.so/allinforsport/docs/e5eb6015-e824-42a0-86d0-55293da514ab).\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n[Permalink: Table of Contents](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance#table-of-contents)\n\n- [Metagovernance](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance/blob/main/broken-reference)\n- [Agreements](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance/blob/main/broken-reference)\n- [Policies](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance/blob/main/#policies)\n- [Archives](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance/blob/main/#archives)\n\n### [Metagovernance](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance/blob/main/broken-reference)\n\n[Permalink: Metagovernance](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance#metagovernance)\n\nThe \"Metagovernance\" category provides the foundational overview of AIFS's governance structure and processes. It outlines how the DAO is organized, how decisions are made, and how different governance domains interact.\n\nThis section includes:\n\n- [DAO Overview](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance/blob/main/governance) \\- The fundamental structure and purpose of AIFS governance\n- [Community Governance](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance/blob/main/governance/community.md) \\- The processes and frameworks for community-driven decision making\n- [Operational Governance](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance/blob/main/governance/operations) \\- The framework for autonomous cells to execute DAO-aligned initiatives\n\nThis section is updated by the Governance Cell when changes to the core governance model are approved through Community Governance.\n\n{% content-ref url=\"broken-reference\" %}\n[Broken link](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance/blob/main/broken-reference)\n{% endcontent-ref %}\n\n### [Agreements](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance/blob/main/\\#agreement)\n\n[Permalink: Agreements](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance#agreements)\n\nThe \"Agreements\" category contains the binding agreements that establish the legal structure and member obligations within AIFS's multicameral governance system. The purpose of this section is to provide a clear record of the commitments made by participants in different governance domains.\n\nThis section can only be updated through governance processes specific to each type of agreement, with Community Governance agreements requiring proposal approval by the DAO.\n\n{% content-ref url=\"agreements/\" %}\n[agreements](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance/blob/main/agreements)\n{% endcontent-ref %}\n\n### [Policies](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance/blob/main/broken-reference)\n\n[Permalink: Policies](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance#policies)\n\nThe \"Policies\" category contains the standards and procedures that govern activities across AIFS. The purpose of this section is to ensure consistent decision-making and operational practices throughout the DAO.\n\nThis section is maintained by delegated governance entities within parameters established by Community Governance.\n\n{% content-ref url=\"policies/\" %}\n[policies](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance/blob/main/policies)\n{% endcontent-ref %}\n\n### [Archives](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance/blob/main/broken-reference)\n\n[Permalink: Archives](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance#archives)\n\nThe \" [Archives](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance/blob/main/broken-reference)\" category contains records of past governance activity and retired articles. The purpose of this section is to provide an accessible, expanded reference for proposals, policies and other documents which might otherwise be spread across multiple sources and data silos.\n\nThis section is updated as needed by the governance team as new proposals are created and corresponding governance state updates are made.\n\n{% content-ref url=\"archive/approvals/\" %}\n[approvals](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance/blob/main/archive/approvals)\n{% endcontent-ref %}\n\n{% content-ref url=\"archive/updates.md\" %}\n[updates.md](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance/blob/main/archive/updates.md)\n{% endcontent-ref %}\n\n{% content-ref url=\"archive/proposals/\" %}\n[proposals](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance/blob/main/archive/proposals)\n{% endcontent-ref %}\n\n## About This Repository\n\n[Permalink: About This Repository](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance#about-this-repository)\n\nThis Governance State Repository is maintained by the Governance Cell to provide a central source of truth for governance activity, transaction approvals, policies and other governance-related information.\n\nThe governance state is version controlled and hosted publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance).

DAO DAO is a collection of contributors all over the world\nwho want to give people the tools to create decentralized autonomous\norganizations. Decentralized autonomous organizations empower\nindividuals to organize themselves to accomplish tasks as a group. DAO\nDAO's intent is for people to use this technology to improve the quality\nof life on Earth and beyond for humans and their more-than-human kin.\n\n### Tools to Make Life Better\n\n[Permalink: Tools to Make Life Better](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/governance/blob/main/constitution.md#tools-to-make-life-better)\n\nThe mission of DAO DAO is to build better governance systems. DAO DAO\nprovides tools to build decentralized autonomous organizations. As DAO DAO\ncontinues to grow and refine its purpose, it will offer better and more\nuseful tools to all those who wish to use them. Imagine a world in which\ndecentralized networks of individuals around the world can organize in a\ncoordinated, transparent, and permissionless way, in real time. To arrive\nat this future, we (\"the \"Founding Members\") must clearly set forth\nDAO DAO's guiding principles and structure in this document. This document\naims to make our intentions clear up front and deter bad actors from\nco-opting this project.\n\n### Building Robust and Decentralized Systems\n\n[Permalink: Building Robust and Decentralized Systems](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/governance/blob/main/constitution.md#building-robust-and-decentralized-systems)\n\nThe Founding Members will include the DAO DAO community in the decision\nmaking process for all proposals. One way this will be done is to make\nsignaling proposals. After a signaling proposal is made, community feedback\ncan be collected and subsequently reflected in an official proposal. This\nwill allow contributors to understand what they are working towards,\naligning the incentives of all contributors. As DAO DAO grows to include\nmore contributors, our governance process will mature. A good governance\nprocess will allow everyone who contributes to DAO DAO to meaningfully\nparticipate.\n\n### Living Document\n\n[Permalink: Living Document](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/governance/blob/main/constitution.md#living-document)\n\nThis Constitution should be considered a \"living document\" that changes\nwith the project and the world. Interpretations and circumstances\nevolve, and we hope that this Constitution will evolve with technology\nand society.\n\n## Legal Definition and Indemnity of Members\n\n[Permalink: Legal Definition and Indemnity of Members](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/governance/blob/main/constitution.md#legal-definition-and-indemnity-of-members)\n\n1. **Membership**. DAO DAO is open to all persons, without arbitrary\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, nationality, religion, age,\nsex, gender, sexual orientation, disability, political\naffiliation, or otherwise. Anyone who holds DAO DAO tokens\n($DAO), are valid Members of DAO DAO (\"Members\"). Members have\nequal rights, as outlined herein, and can contribute anonymously\nif they wish. Members can come and go as they see fit and may\nparticipate in governance decisions when and how they see fit (or\nnot). Members that contribute to DAO DAO may be rewarded by DAO\nDAO via on-chain governance votes or via off-chain rewards. Any\nmember or group of Members may distribute their tokens in any way\nthey see fit.\n\n2. **Legal Status of DAO DAO.** Given that anyone in the world can be a\nmember of DAO DAO, we want to clarify that DAO DAO does not\nrecognize or consent to any particular jurisdiction. It is a\nwholly international, primarily online, organization that exists\nbecause of the contributions of its global membership. Even if DAO\nDAO interfaces with government institutions in the future, DAO DAO\nviews its true jurisdiction as the Internet, and thus maintains\nits jurisdictional independence unless otherwise amended in this\nConstitution.\n\n3. **Tax Obligations of Members**. All Members are solely responsible\nfor their own individual tax obligations related to DAO DAO and\n$DAO tokens.\n\n4. **Indemnity for Multi-Signature Signers and Founding Members**. Some\nactions of this DAO must be carried out by multi-signature signers\n(\"Signers\") or other Founding Members. Signers have a\nnon-discretionary duty to carry out the will of DAO DAO. DAO DAO\nwill indemnify Signers and Founding Members for any liability\nincurred when carrying out non-discretionary duties on behalf of\nthis DAO. The funds for such indemnification (including legal\nfees, costs, and damages) shall be taken from DAO DAO's treasury\nas needed.\n\n5. **Non-affiliation with User-DAOs**. DAO DAO exists in large part to\nfacilitate the creation of more DAOs (\"User-DAOs\"). These\nUser-DAOs are created in a permissionless fashion, and DAO DAO\ndoes not sanction each User-DAO nor its purpose. DAO DAO does not\ncondone nor otherwise affiliate itself with User-DAOs or their\noutcomes. Additionally, no DAO DAO Members or affiliates shall be\nheld responsible for the actions of any of its User-DAOs or their\nmembers. DAO DAO and its members are not responsible for financial\ngain or loss related to User-DAOs.\n\n6. **Establishment of Sub-DAOs**. Certain decision-making powers may be\ndelegated to \"Sub-DAOs.\" Each Sub-DAO shall be responsible for (i)\nmaking decisions within its respective subject area, and (ii) its\nown operation and maintenance. DAO DAO Members can formally create\nSub-DAOs by majority vote. Sub-DAOs can be created or dissolved at\nany time by DAO DAO. Sub-DAOs may or may not have treasuries that\nare separate from DAO DAO's main treasury.\n\n\n## Rights of Members and Voting Procedures\n\n[Permalink: Rights of Members and Voting Procedures](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/governance/blob/main/constitution.md#rights-of-members-and-voting-procedures)\n\n1. **Rights of Members**. $DAO token ownership grants the holder a\nright to participate in DAO DAO governance processes. DAO DAO\nshall under no circumstances invalidate Member rights as a result\nof how said Member acquired their $DAO or for any other reason.\nOne staked $DAO token will be equivalent to one vote in DAO DAO.\n\n2. **Governance**. The following governance procedures are hereby\noutlined:\n\na. **Voting**. Each staked $DAO token represents one \"vote.\" A\n\"majority vote\" means that Quorum (as defined below) has been\nreached and that more than ½ of all staked $DAO token holders\nthat participate in the vote have voted in a specific\ndirection at the time of the vote. All other voting amounts\nreferenced in this Constitution shall refer to amounts of\nstaked $DAO outstanding at the time of the vote in question.\n\nb. **Making DAO Proposals**. Any Member can propose a DAO Proposal\n(\"DP\") so long as they have the requisite number of $DAO tokens\nto bring a proposal (a \"Proposal Deposit\"). The initial Proposal\nDeposit will be set by DAO DAO and can be changed by majority\nvote. DAO DAO will determine how voting works through DAO DAO\ngovernance and all relevant information will be stored on-chain.\n\nc. **Validly Passed DAO Proposals**. A validly passed DAO Proposal\nshall be defined as a validly brought DAO Proposal that passes\nthe DAO's voting process. The voting process will be set by\nDAO governance and defined on-chain, unless otherwise\nspecified in this Constitution.\n\nd. **Quorum**. Quorum shall initially be set by DAO DAO and can be\nchanged by majority vote.\n\n3. **Code of Conduct**. Harassment, bullying, hate speech, racism,\nsexism, sexual gratuitousness, ageism, homophobia, transphobia,\nand all other forms of discrimination are not tolerated within the\nDAO. Rudeness and consistent negativity are strongly discouraged.\nMembers are encouraged to promote an exciting, welcoming space.\nViolating community standards may result in removal from shared\nspaces. Holding $DAO tokens does not guarantee access to common\nspaces.\n\n\n## Enforceability and Changing the Constitution.\n\n[Permalink: Enforceability and Changing the Constitution.](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/governance/blob/main/constitution.md#enforceability-and-changing-the-constitution)\n\n1. **Limitations of This Constitution**. DAO DAO recognizes that certain\ndecisions cannot be made on-chain. As such, contributors and Founding\nMembers may carry out off-chain decisions and initiatives without DAO\napproval, when appropriate. If the necessity of such initiatives are\ncalled into question, this DAO may vote, through validly passed DPs, to\nsuspend the activity or restrict funds that are being used in\nfurtherance of said activity.\n\n2. **Changes to this Constitution**. This Constitution can only be changed\nby a valid Quorum of $DAO tokens, with a 2/3 majority vote. Any Member\nmay propose an amendment. An approved amendment to this Constitution\nshall become effective immediately following approval unless such\namendment expressly provides otherwise.\n\n3. **Interpretation**. This DAO shall have the power to interpret this\nConstitution, apply such interpretations to particular circumstances,\nand adopt policies in furtherance of such interpretations, provided\nthat all such actions are reasonable and consistent.\n\n\n#### Signatures\n\n[Permalink: Signatures](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/governance/blob/main/constitution.md#signatures)\n\n- jakehartnell\n- ekez\n- noah\n- elsehow\n- case\n- callum\n- baoskees\n- bluenote\n- de-husk\n- bmorphism\n- maxjuno\n- trevorjtclarke\n- kevingarrison\n- ebaker\n- sagarsaija\n- modern-edamame\n- rakataprime\n- ben2x4\n- gavindoughtie\n- the-frey\n- HorizonsLaw\n- pyramation\n- nullmames\n- jackzampolin\n- vernonjohnson\n- onewhiskeypls\n- albttx\n- grubcowboy\n- avicenna\n- mamimisan\n- ethanfrey\n- cypherape\n- nicolaslara\n- TendermintTimmy\n- jahedmomand\n- whalelephant\n- sascha1337\n- 0xFable\n- LeTurt\n\nYou can’t perform that action at this time.",

[Documentation](https://gaiaaiagent.github.io/Docs/) \\| 🍄 [Join the Community](https://linktr.ee/gaiaaiagent)\n\n## 🌲 Overview\n\n[Permalink: 🌲 Overview](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/GAIA#-overview)\n\nGAIA AI is a decentralized intelligence network designed to catalyze exponential regeneration across Earth's biosphere. Our core components include:\n\nTechnology Stack: Interoperable AI agents, knowledge graphs, and data analytics that process planetary health metrics\n\nEconomic Model: Token systems and regenerative finance mechanisms that direct resources to high-impact projects\n\nCultural Movement: Memetic strategies and community engagement that inspire collective action\n\nGovernance: A hybrid model combining AI swarm intelligence with human wisdom through our DAO structure\n\nOur mission is to unite technological innovation, ecological restoration, and cultural transformation to usher in the symbiocene - an era where digital and biological intelligence collaborate for planetary healing.\n\n## ✨ Features\n\n[Permalink: ✨ Features](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/GAIA#-features)\n\n- 🛠️ Full-featured Discord, Twitter and Telegram connectors\n- 🔗 Support for every model (Llama, Grok, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)\n- 👥 Multi-agent and room support\n- 📚 Easily ingest and interact with your documents\n- 💾 Retrievable memory and document store\n- 🚀 Highly extensible - create your own actions and clients\n- ☁️ Supports many models (local Llama, OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, etc.)\n- 📦 Just works!\n\n## 🌿 Quick Start\n\n[Permalink: 🌿 Quick Start](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/GAIA#-quick-start)\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n[Permalink: Prerequisites](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/GAIA#prerequisites)\n\n- [Python 2.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n- [Node.js 23+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)\n- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/gaia.git\ncd gaia\ncp .env.example .env\npnpm i && pnpm build && pnpm start\n```\n\nOnce the agent is running, you should see the message to run \"pnpm start:client\" at the end.\nOpen another terminal and move to same directory and then run below command and follow the URL to chat to your agent.\n\n```\npnpm start:client\n```\n\n### Running the GAIA characters\n\n[Permalink: Running the GAIA characters](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/GAIA#running-the-gaia-characters)\n\n1. Edit characters in `characters/`\n2. Run multiple characters with:\n\n```\npnpm start --character=\"characters/gaia.character.json,characters/terranova.character.json,characters/aquarius.character.json,characters/nexus.character.json\"\n```\n\n3. Connect with X and discord\n   - change `\"clients\": []` to `\"clients\": [\"twitter\",\"discord\"]` in the character files to connect agents to X or discord\n\n### Manually Start Gaia\n\n[Permalink: Manually Start Gaia](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/GAIA#manually-start-gaia)\n\n```\npnpm i\npnpm build\npnpm start\n\n# The project iterates fast, sometimes you need to clean the project if you are coming back to the project\npnpm clean\n```\n\n### Community & contact\n\n[Permalink: Community & contact](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/GAIA#community--contact)\n\n- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/gaia/issues).\n- [Join the Community](https://linktr.ee/gaiaaiagent).\n\n[![](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/GAIA/raw/gaiav0.1.9/docs/static/img/gaia_banner2.jpeg)](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/gaia/graphs/contributors)\n\n## Star History\n\n[Permalink: Star History](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/GAIA#star-history)\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3488f00ab4b2c4faa1b596841e982f72f00065d4451c19333dbc55fc6cb458f8/68747470733a2f2f6170692e737461722d686973746f72792e636f6d2f7376673f7265706f733d6761696161696167656e742f4741494126747970653d44617465)](https://www.star-history.com/#gaiaaiagent/GAIA&Date)\n\n## About\n\nGUILD of ALTRUISTIC INTEROPERABLE AGENTS\n\n\n[linktr.ee/gaiaaiagent](https://linktr.ee/gaiaaiagent \"https://linktr.ee/gaiaaiagent\")\n\n### Topics\n\n[gaia](https://github.com/topics/gaia \"Topic: gaia\") [base](https://github.com/topics/base \"Topic: base\") [eth](https://github.com/topics/eth \"Topic: eth\") [eliza](https://github.com/topics/eliza \"Topic: eliza\") [regeneration](https://github.com/topics/regeneration \"Topic: regeneration\") [virtuals](https://github.com/topics/virtuals \"Topic: virtuals\")\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/GAIA#readme-ov-file)\n\n### License\n\n[MIT license](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/GAIA#MIT-1-ov-file)\n\n### Code of conduct\n\n[Code of conduct](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/GAIA#coc-ov-file)\n\n### Contributing\n\n[Contributing](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/GAIA#contributing-ov-file)\n\n### Security policy\n\n[Security policy](https://github.com/gaiaaiagent/GAIA#security-ov-file)\n\n### Uh oh!\n\nThere was an error while loading.

[HatsAccountBase](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#HatsAccountbase), an abstract contract designed to be inherited by various flavors of HatsAccount\n2. [HatsAccount1ofN](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#HatsAccount1ofn), a flavor of HatsAccount that mirrors the typical 1-of-n security model of hat-based role and permission management\n3. [HatsAccountMofN](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#HatsAccountmofn), a flavor of HatsAccount that supports m-of-n security models, somewhat like a multisig of hat wearers\n\n## Overview\n\n[Permalink: Overview](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#overview)\n\nHatsAccount gives every Hats Protocol hat a smart contract account. Each hat can have multiple flavors of HatsAccount, each following the ERC6551 standard and designed to be deployed via the ERC6551Registry factory.\n\nHatsAccount gives every hat the ability to do the following:\n\n- Send ETH, ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 tokens\n- Sign ERC1271-compatible messages, e.g. as a signer on a multisig\n- Become a member of a DAO and make/vote on proposals, e.g. in a Moloch DAO\n- Call functions on other contracts\n- `Delegatecall` to other contracts, via [tokenbound](https://github.com/tokenbound/contracts)'s [sandbox](https://github.com/jaydenwindle/delegatecall-sandbox/) concept\n- Be assigned permissions in address-based onchain access control schemes\n\nApart from the first and last, all of these actions are performed by the hat's wearer(s), with the security model determined by the flavor of HatsAccount.\n\n## HatsAccountBase\n\n[Permalink: HatsAccountBase](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#hatsaccountbase)\n\nHatsAccountBase is an abstract contract built with [tokenbound's library](https://github.com/tokenbound/contracts) that provides the following common functionality for all other HatsAccount flavors:\n\n- Ability to receive ETH (or other EVM chain-native tokens), ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 tokens\n- Implementation of the `IERC6551Account` interface, including / as well as getter functions for the account deployment parameters\n\n  - `salt()`\n  - `HATS()` — the address of the Hats Protocol contract, aka the `IERC6551Account.token.tokenContract`\n  - `hat()` — the id of the hat that this HatsAccount represents, aka the `IERC6551Account.token.tokenId`\n  - `IMPLEMENTATION()` — the address of the implementation contract for the inheriting flavor of HatsAccount\n- Implementation of `IERC6551Account.isValidSigner` that sets wearers of the `hat()` as valid signers\n- Internal `_updateState` function adhering to the `IERC6551Account` standard\n- EIP-721-compliant message-hashing function for use in signing and verifying messages by inheriting HatsAccount flavors\n- [tokenbound](https://github.com/tokenbound/contracts)'s `BaseExecutor`, for use in executing transactions by inheriting HatsAccount flavors\n\n### Delegatecalls\n\n[Permalink: Delegatecalls](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#delegatecalls)\n\nFor safety, HatsAccountBase constrains `delegatecall`s, only executing them from a special sandbox account coupled with the HatsAccount1ofN instance. This protects the HatsAccount from storage collision and self-destruct from malicious target contracts, with the tradeoff that the target contract must know — or be told about — the sandbox pattern in order for the `delegatecall` to succeed.\n\nSee the [delegatecall-sandbox docs](https://github.com/jaydenwindle/delegatecall-sandbox/) for more details.\n\n## HatsAccount1ofN\n\n[Permalink: HatsAccount1ofN](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#hatsaccount1ofn)\n\nHatsAccount1ofN is a flavor of HatsAccount that mirrors the typical 1-of-n security model of hat-based role and permission management. Any single wearer of a HatsAccount1ofN instance's hat has full control over that HatsAccount. If a hat has multiple wearers, they each individually have full control.\n\n### 1ofN: Executing Transactions\n\n[Permalink: 1ofN: Executing Transactions](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#1ofn-executing-transactions)\n\nAny single wearer of the hat can execute transactions under the hat's authority. For individual transactions, this is done by calling the `execute()` function, which conforms to the `ERC6551Executable` interface and takes the following arguments:\n\n- `to` — the address of the contract to call\n- `value` — the amount of ETH to send with the call\n- `data` — the calldata to send with the call, which encodes the target function signature and arguments\n- `operation` — the type of call to make, either `call` (0), or `delegatecall` (1) — other operations are disallowed\n\nFor multiple transactions, this is done by calling the `executeBatch()` function, which takes as its sole argument an array of `Operations`. An `Operation` is a struct containing the same properties as the arguments of the `execute()` function above.\n\nIf execution succeeds, the HatsAccount's `state` is updated in compliance with the ERC6551 standard.\n\n### 1ofN: Signing Messages\n\n[Permalink: 1ofN: Signing Messages](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#1ofn-signing-messages)\n\nAny single wearer of the hat can also sign messages on the hat's behalf. Other applications or contracts can verify that such signatures are valid by calling the `isValidSignature()` function, which takes the following arguments:\n\n- `hash` — the keccak256 hash of the signed message, which can optionally be calculated with the `HatsAccountBase.getMessageHash()` function for compatibility with EIP-712.\n- `signature` — the signature to verify\n\nThe signature is considered valid as long as it is either...\n\n- a valid ECDSA signature by a wearer of the hat, or\n- a valid EIP-1271 signature by a wearer of the hat\n\nThis design follows [Gnosis Mech](https://github.com/gnosis/mech)'s approach, and creates flexibility for recursive validation of nested signatures. See [their docs for more details](https://github.com/gnosis/mech/tree/main#eip-1271-signatures).\n\n## HatsAccountMofN\n\n[Permalink: HatsAccountMofN](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#hatsaccountmofn)\n\nHatsAccountMofN is a flavor of HatsAccount that supports m-of-n security models, somewhat like a multisig of hat wearers. To take any action with HatsAccount, m of the n present wearers of the hat must approve the action.\n\n### M of N Security Model\n\n[Permalink: M of N Security Model](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#m-of-n-security-model)\n\nThe specific security model of a given HatsAccountMofN instance is determined by a) the number of present wearers of the hat (ie the hat's supply), and b) the `THRESHOLD_RANGE` configured for that instance. As the supply of the hat changes, the required number of approvals to execute actions — given by `getThreshold()` — will move within the `THRESHOLD_RANGE`.\n\nThese parameters are encoded at deployment time in the `salt` parameter of the `IERC6551Registry.deployAccount` function.\n\n- `MIN_THRESHOLD` — the first (leftmost) byte of the `salt` parameter\n- `MAX_THRESHOLD` — the second byte of the `salt` parameter\n\nFor example, a `MIN_THRESHOLD` of 2 and a `MAX_THRESHOLD` of 5 would result in a `salt` value of `0x0205000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`. The actual threshold at any given time — the value returned by `getThreshold()` — is a function of the hat's present supply:\n\n- When supply is less than `MIN_THRESHOLD`, the threshold is `MIN_THRESHOLD`\n- When supply is greater than `MAX_THRESHOLD`, the threshold is `MAX_THRESHOLD`\n- When supply is between `MIN_THRESHOLD` and `MAX_THRESHOLD`, the threshold is the supply\n\n### MofN: Executing Transactions\n\n[Permalink: MofN: Executing Transactions](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#mofn-executing-transactions)\n\nM of the n wearers of the hat can execute transactions under the hat's authority. This is done with a simple onchain proposal and voting system:\n\n- Any wearer of the hat can propose a transaction\n- Any account can vote on a proposal, but only votes from wearers of the at _at execution time_ count\n- Like a multisig, there is no voting period — a proposal can be executed as soon as it has enough approvals\n- Unlike some multisig and DAO contracts, proposals can be executed in any order\n\n#### Proposing Transactions\n\n[Permalink: Proposing Transactions](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#proposing-transactions)\n\nAny wearer of the hat can propose a transaction by calling the `propose()` function, which takes the following arguments:\n\n- `operations` — an array of `Operations`, the same struct used in [`HatsAccount1ofN.executeBatch()`](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#1ofn-executing-transactions)\n- `expiration` — a uint32 timestamp after which the proposal will be not be executable even if it has enough approvals, similar to how [MolochV3](https://github.com/HausDAO/Baal/) handles proposal expiration.\n- `descriptionHash` — a bytes32 hash of the proposal description, similar to Governor's descriptionHash parameter. Beyond a commitment to a human-readable description, this can be used to make otherwise-identical proposals unique by including a small change in the description.\n\nProposers also have the option to submit an approval vote with their proposal, by calling the `proposeWithApproval()` function.\n\n##### Proposal Ids and Storage\n\n[Permalink: Proposal Ids and Storage](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#proposal-ids-and-storage)\n\nUnlike some multisig and DAO contracts, HatsAccountMofN proposals can be executed in any order. There is no voting period, proposals can be executed as soon as they have enough approvals, and proposal ids are not sequential.\n\nProposal ids are bytes32 values derived from the proposal's `operations`, `expiration`, and `descriptionHash` parameters.\n\nFor gas-efficiency, the only data stored in contract state for each proposal is a) a mapping between the proposal's id and its current status, and b) a mapping between the proposal's id, the accounts who have [voted](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#voting-on-proposals) on it, and those votes. To ensure that the `expiration` parameter can be read without having to store it separately, the expiration timestamp is encoded in the proposal id.\n\nProposal ids are generated via the `getProposalId()` function, which is defined as follows:\n\n1. Hash together the operations array and the description hash\n2. Shift the resulting value 32 bits to the left to truncate the most significant 8 bytes and open up the least significant 8 bytes\n3. Insert the expiration into the empty least significant 8 bytes with bitwise OR\n4. Cast the resulting value to bytes32\n\nThe result is a bytes32 of the form `0x[A][B]`, where:\n\n- `[A]` is the truncated hash of the operations array and the description hash, occupying the first 24 bytes\n- `[B]` is the expiration timestamp, occupying the last 8 bytes\n\n`[A]` has 4 more bytes of entropy than Ethereum addresses, so we can be confident that the ids of different proposals ids will not collide.\n\n##### Proposal Status\n\n[Permalink: Proposal Status](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#proposal-status)\n\nProposals can have one of five statuses:\n\n0. NULL — the proposal does not exist\n1. PENDING — the proposal has been created, but has not yet been executed\n2. EXECUTED — the proposal has been executed\n3. REJECTED — the proposal has been rejected\n4. EXPIRED — the proposal has expired\n\nNote that the statuses 0-3 are stored onchain in the `proposalStatuses` mapping, while the EXPIRED status is not. This is because the EXPIRED status is a function of the proposal's expiration timestamp, which is [encoded in the proposal id](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#proposal-ids-and-storage).\n\nA proposal can be considered EXPIRED if its stored status is PENDING and its expiration timestamp is in the past.\n\n#### Voting on Proposals\n\n[Permalink: Voting on Proposals](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#voting-on-proposals)\n\nAny account can vote on any PENDING proposal. Since signer validity — i.e. hat-wearing — is checked at execution time, there's no need to check it at voting time.\n\nVoters can cast either APPROVE or REJECT votes, and can change their votes at any time prior to execution. Votes are cast by calling the `vote()` function, which takes the following arguments:\n\n- `proposalId` — the id of the proposal to vote on\n- `vote` — the vote to cast, either\\* APPROVE (1) or REJECT (2)\n\n\\*Note that the `Vote` enum also includes a NULL (0) value, which is the default. To remove an existing vote, voters can cast a NULL vote.\n\n#### Executing Proposals\n\n[Permalink: Executing Proposals](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#executing-proposals)\n\nAny account can execute any PENDING, non-expired proposal that has [enough approvals](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#m-of-n-security-model). This is done by calling the `execute()` function, which takes the following arguments:\n\n- `operations` — an array of `Operations`\n- `expiration` — the expiration timestamp of the proposal\n- `descriptionHash` — the description hash of the proposal\n- `voters` — an array of addresses that have voted to approve the proposal. The array must be strictly sorted in ascending order with no duplicates to ensure that votes are not double-counted. Its length must be greater than or equal to the threshold.\n\nThe `execute()` function checks each of the voters in the `voters` array to ensure that they are wearers of the hat. If they are, and they voted to APPROVE for the proposalId derived from the other parameters, their vote is counted. If they are not, their vote is ignored. If the number of counted votes is greater than or equal to the [threshold](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#m-of-n-security-model), the proposal is executed.\n\nSince `operations` is an array of `Operations`, each operation must succeed for execution to succeed. Any reverting operation will cause the entire execution to revert. Execution can be attempted again until the proposal expires.\n\n#### Rejecting Proposals\n\n[Permalink: Rejecting Proposals](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#rejecting-proposals)\n\nFor a proposal to be rejectable, it must receive enough REJECT votes such that the proposal could not be executed without a rejector changing their vote to APPROVE. This is different than other multisigs — which typically enforce the same threshold for approval and rejection — since HatsAccountMofN proposals can be executed in any order.\n\nThe primary reason to reject a proposal is to clear it from the list of PENDING proposals in front end applications. Note that rejecting a proposal does not prevent the same proposal from being re-proposed and executed.\n\nAny account can reject any PENDING, non-expired proposal that has enough rejections. This is done by calling the `reject()` function, which takes the following arguments:\n\n- `proposalId`\n- `voters` — an array of addresses that have voted to reject the proposal. The array must be strictly sorted in ascending order with no duplicates to ensure that votes are not double-counted. Its length must be greater than or equal to the rejection threshold.\n\nThe `reject()` function checks each of the voters in the `voters` array to ensure that they are wearers of the hat. If they are, and they voted to REJECT, their vote is counted. If they are not, their vote is ignored. If the number of counted votes is greater than or equal to the rejection threshold — given by `getRejectionThreshold()`, the proposal is rejected.\n\n#### Front End Helpers\n\n[Permalink: Front End Helpers](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#front-end-helpers)\n\nThe following view functions are provided to help front end applications manage and display accurate information about proposals:\n\n- `getProposalId()` \\- see [Proposal Ids and Storage](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#proposal-ids-and-storage)\n- `getThreshold()` \\- see [M of N Security Model](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#m-of-n-security-model)\n- `getRejectionThreshold()` \\- see [Rejecting Proposals](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#rejecting-proposals)\n- `getExpiration()` \\- extracts the expiration timestamp of a proposal from the last 8 bytes of its id\n- `isExecutableNow()` — returns true if the proposal is PENDING and has enough valid approvals, otherwise reverts\n- `isRejectableNow()` — returns true if the proposal is PENDING and has enough valid rejections, otherwise reverts\n- `validVoteCountsNow()` — returns the number of valid approvals and rejections for the proposal\n\n### MofN: Signing Messages\n\n[Permalink: MofN: Signing Messages](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#mofn-signing-messages)\n\nHatsAccount1ofN can produce valid EIP-1271 signatures on the hat's behalf, but the process is different from HatsAccount1ofN. Instead of a valid signer — i.e. hat-wearer — producing a cryptographic signature of the message, HatsAccountMofN marks a message as \"signed\" by adding the message's hash to a list of signed messages.\n\nThis can be done by executing a proposal which calls the `HatsAccountMofN.sign()` function. This function is only callable by the HatsAccountMofN instance itself, and takes a single argument: `message` — the bytes of the message itself, of arbitrary length.\n\nWhen called, the `sign()` function gets the hash of the message and marks it as signed in the `signedMessages` mapping.\n\n#### Message Hashing\n\n[Permalink: Message Hashing](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#message-hashing)\n\nIn HatsAccount, messages are hashed following the EIP-712 standard with a design similar to [Safe's message hashing scheme](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/blob/f03dfae65fd1d085224b00a10755c509a4eaacfe/contracts/libraries/SignMessageLib.sol#L33).\n\nWhen signing a message, `sign()` takes care of the hashing. When verifying a signature via `IERC1271.isValidSignature()`, the message must be hashed by the caller. For convenience, HatsAccountMofN exposes the `getMessageHash()` function.\n\n## Development and Testing\n\n[Permalink: Development and Testing](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-account#development-and-testing)\n\nThis repo uses Foundry for development and testing.

As a community-driven organization focused on sustainability and collective action, we maintain transparent, version-controlled governance to ensure our operations align with our values and mission.\n\n## Repository Structure\n\n[Permalink: Repository Structure](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance#repository-structure)\n\nThis governance repository is organized into three main sections:\n\n- **[Agreements](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance/blob/main/agreements)**: Core commitments between participants, including our Code of Conduct, Community Guidelines, and Operating Agreement.\n- **[Policies](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance/blob/main/policies)**: Procedures and standards for various activities, organized by functional area.\n- **[Archives](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance/blob/main/archive)**: Historical records of past proposals and decisions, providing institutional memory.\n\n## About ICS\n\n[Permalink: About ICS](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance#about-ics)\n\nThe Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) is a federal not-for-profit organization based in London, Ontario. Our vision is collective liberation: a world where people live in peace and harmony with each other and nature. Our mission is to help people live more sustainable and connected lives.\n\nWe are guided by our values:\n\n- Equity, diversity, and inclusivity\n- Community resilience and solidarity\n- Radical love and imagination\n- Sustainability and land stewardship\n- Trust and accountability\n- Self-awareness and reflexivity\n- Humility, honesty, and courage\n\n## Governance Framework\n\n[Permalink: Governance Framework](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance#governance-framework)\n\nICS governance follows a cell-based structure that combines established practices of not-for-profit governance with decentralized, participatory elements inspired by web3 technologies and DAO principles. Our governance model aims to distribute decision-making power while maintaining alignment with our mission and values.\n\nThe core document describing our governance structure is the [Cell State](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance/blob/main/cell_state.md) document, which outlines the roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes of our organization.\n\n## Key Infrastructure\n\n[Permalink: Key Infrastructure](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance#key-infrastructure)\n\n- **Multisig Wallet**: [0x3B454B53B4c414fFa8297EC49C9d5F040Cf035f8](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3B454B53B4c414fFa8297EC49C9d5F040Cf035f8)\n- **ENS Domain**: [theics.eth](https://app.ens.domains/name/theics.eth)\n- **CharmVerse Space**: [ICS Workspace](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/ics-workspace-6136932233367063)\n- **Hats Protocol Tree**: [Tree 100/119](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/100/119)\n\n## Programs\n\n[Permalink: Programs](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance#programs)\n\nICS operates several key programs that advance our mission:\n\n- **Repair Café**: Community-led repair events that keep items out of landfills\n- **Thing Library**: A lending library of tools and household items\n- **Green Pill London**: A local chapter of the global Green Pill Network\n- **Learning Circles**: Co-learning sessions on sustainability and community resilience\n\n## Contributing\n\n[Permalink: Contributing](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance#contributing)\n\nICS governance documentation is maintained through our established governance processes.

Our governance model aims to distribute decision-making power while maintaining alignment with our mission and values.\n\nThe core document describing our governance structure is the [Cell State](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance/blob/main/cell_state.md) document, which outlines the roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes of our organization.\n\n## Key Infrastructure\n\n[Permalink: Key Infrastructure](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance#key-infrastructure)\n\n- **Multisig Wallet**: [0x3B454B53B4c414fFa8297EC49C9d5F040Cf035f8](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3B454B53B4c414fFa8297EC49C9d5F040Cf035f8)\n- **ENS Domain**: [theics.eth](https://app.ens.domains/name/theics.eth)\n- **CharmVerse Space**: [ICS Workspace](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/ics-workspace-6136932233367063)\n- **Hats Protocol Tree**: [Tree 100/119](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/100/119)\n\n## Programs\n\n[Permalink: Programs](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance#programs)\n\nICS operates several key programs that advance our mission:\n\n- **Repair Café**: Community-led repair events that keep items out of landfills\n- **Thing Library**: A lending library of tools and household items\n- **Green Pill London**: A local chapter of the global Green Pill Network\n- **Learning Circles**: Co-learning sessions on sustainability and community resilience\n\n## Contributing\n\n[Permalink: Contributing](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance#contributing)\n\nICS governance documentation is maintained through our established governance processes. Changes to governance documents must be approved through the appropriate channels before being implemented in this repository.\n\nFor more information on how changes are made, please see our [Governance](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance/blob/main/governance.md) document.\n\n## Contact\n\n[Permalink: Contact](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance#contact)\n\nFor questions about ICS governance, please reach out to [connect@communitysustainability.ca](mailto:connect@communitysustainability.ca) or visit our website at [communitysustainability.ca](https://communitysustainability.ca/).\n\n## About\n\nICS Governance Documents\n\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance#readme-ov-file)\n\n### License\n\n[Unlicense license](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance#Unlicense-1-ov-file)\n\n### Contributing\n\n[Contributing](https://github.com/icsdao/ics-governance#contributing-ov-file)\n\n### Uh oh!\n\nThere was an error while loading.

It has had minor updates since then, but it may be very out of date. For more up-to-date information, daily discussions and reviews please visit:**_\n\n- [\"Clean-NFTs\" discord](https://discord.com/invite/X2BefZVtWh)\n- [\"Clean-NFTs Developer Community\" spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A-7Ama31sYWhXDl6NoJaXnbAV9pFbjxLIgl7jb3CHOs/edit#gid=0)\n- [cleannfts.org](https://cleannfts.org/)\n\n## Introduction\n\n[Permalink: Introduction](https://github.com/memoakten/eco-nft#introduction)\n\n_This article is not a comprehensive “CryptoArt for beginners”. It’s more of a very brief (as possible) **first step** towards a guide for the adventurous artist who wants to create and sell CryptoArtworks (or NFTs) on the blockchain - **on sustainable platforms**. Since the field is moving so rapidly, **the information below is likely to go out of date very quickly**. We will try to keep it up to date via [pull-requests](https://github.com/memo/eco-nft/pulls) and [issues](https://github.com/memo/eco-nft/issues). And I **hope the platforms themselves will add relevant information, “Statement of Values”, and roadmaps to their own site**._\n\n* * *\n\nThe CryptoArt NFT Market (i.e. selling digital art on the blockchain) is worth at least $150M - and this excludes some of the largest marketplaces like [opensea.io](http://opensea.io/), (and this figure is quite heavily skewed of course, with the top artists earning the most \\[ [1](https://cryptoart.io/artists)\\]).\n\nSelling work on a blockchain can be a technically challenging task. For this reason, many platforms and websites have emerged, aiming to make this process as seamless and easy as possible for artists. Unfortunately, currently many of these websites are based on the Ethereum blockchain, which is very inefficient and ecologically costly by design. E.g. selling just a single-edition artwork on Ethereum has a carbon footprint starting at around 100 KgCO2, which is equivalent to a 1 hour flight (and depending on the platform, can reach a long-haul flight) \\[ [2](https://memoakten.medium.com/the-unreasonable-ecological-cost-of-cryptoart-2221d3eb2053)\\]. Selling an edition of 100 works has a carbon footprint of over 10 tonnes CO2, which is more than the per capita annual footprint of someone in the EU - including all emissions from industry and trade \\[ [3](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions#co2-embedded-in-trade)\\].\n\nBut there are more sustainable routes emerging. As the CryptoArt NFT market is exploding in a gold-rush style free-for-all, there is a lack of clear information on the ecological impact of different approaches to NFTs. The purpose of this guide is to help CryptoArtists who are interested in exploring more sustainable alternatives. Currently, these more sustainable platforms do not have the volume of their unsustainable counterparts (i.e. the Ethereum-based platforms). For this reason, collectors and sales are likely to be significantly lower too on the more sustainable alternatives. However, hopefully as more artists migrate to these emerging waters, this can encourage platforms, developers, investors and collectors, to bridge to develop more **ecologically friendly and transparent platforms**.\n\n**We are also hoping the platforms themselves will be more transparent on the matter, and we can eventually retire this document**. However, at the time of writing, not a single platform has publicly acknowledged the issue on their website. When they do, the relevant links will be included below.\n\n**What would be great to see from CryptoArt / NFT platforms regarding sustainability**:\n\n- A statement of values\n- A commitment to transparency, communication and guidance for CryptoArtists\n- A roadmap (other than “We hope ETH2 will resolve the issue when it’s released in a year or two\" - e.g. alternate chains, side chains, lazy minting, layer 2 scaling which are currently in the process of supporting. Including bounties to PoS chains and wallets to create a solution to PoW etc)\n- A donation of proceeds to carbon credits or to subsidize the ecological footprint and their direct environmental impact\n\n* * *\n\n## Glossary\n\n[Permalink: Glossary](https://github.com/memoakten/eco-nft#glossary)\n\nThe purpose of this section is to introduce concepts in an incredibly brief (1-2 sentences each) manner. For more information please follow the links.\n\n- **Blockchain**: A decentralized database. The technicalities of this are not relevant for our discussion. What is important to know however, is that there are many different blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Algorand, Polkadot etc), and usually, each blockchain has its own (crypto)currency.\n- **Cryptocurrency**: Magic internet money. Bitcoin (BTC) is the most well known cryptocurrency and the oldest. Ethereum (ETH) is another well known cryptocurrency (and the basis for most current CryptoArt platforms). There are thousands of other cryptocurrencies (typically small volume cryptocurrencies are collectively known as **altcoins**).\n- **CryptoArt**: Art registered on the blockchain. I.e. Media is associated with an **NFT**.\n[https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/1/14/what-is-cryptoart](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/1/14/what-is-cryptoart)\n- **NFT**: Non-Fungible Token. A unique token (i.e. long number or string) that is associated with some media (e.g. image, video, poem, whatever) or any unique asset, such as a house, property etc which has its ID or file registered specifically to one block on the blockchain.\nDetailed description: [https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens)\n- **Smart Contract**: A fancy way of saying “a program that lives and runs on the blockchain”. Smart contracts are what creates and keeps track of NFTs, ASAs, Dapps etc. Some of these types of contracts can be legally binding.\n- **Minting an NFT**: The act of ‘creating’ an NFT, i.e. registering the token on the blockchain, and associating it with your media (e.g. file).\n- **NFT Platform / Marketplace**: A website which allows people to buy & sell NFTs. Think ebay or Amazon, except it uses a blockchain in the background. Different platforms can:\n\n  - use different blockchains (though currently nearly all of them use Ethereum)\n  - use different approaches to accepting artists. e.g.:\n    - anyone can register immediately\n    - anyone can apply, but applicants are manually accepted (or not - and some are more selective than others)\n    - invite only\n  - **NFT Minting only** (website uses its own smart-contract) vs **NFT Factory** (allows artist to own smart-contract, this can allow artist more control)\n  - Compatible with other platforms (e.g. list the same work on multiple platforms)\n- **Gas fee**: A fee one must pay (usually paid by the seller, i.e. artist) to be able to publish, i.e. mint (think ebay listing fee) on Ethereum. This fee goes not to the platform, but to Ethereum to compensate for the computing energy required to process and validate transactions. Currently Ethereum gas fees are very high and fluctuate (e.g. >$100-$1000) with network congestion. Some days and times are dramatically less or more due to current on-chain demand. There are some existing and WIP solutions discussed in the next section.\n- **Wallet**: A blockchain analog for a bank account on the blockchain, which contains your cryptocurrency. Different cryptocurrencies often require different wallets. Without going into too much detail, usually this is a piece of software, hardware (or browser extension) which gives you a **private seed** \\- which is typically a bunch of random words, like “red fox banana submarine tutu” (this is like your password for the wallet, which you should keep safe and never share with anyone!) and a corresponding ‘hashed’ version (e.g. 17ah2k25djhsa7974) which is your public facing **wallet address** (like an IBAN, so it’s what you share with others to get paid or trade).\n- **Consensus Algorithm**: The algorithm that underlies the blockchain. Details of this are irrelevant for this guide, except to say that Proof-of-Work (PoW) is the consensus algorithm that is hundreds of times more inefficient than the other ones (deliberately so), and is also the one which is the most common today unfortunately. For familiarity, here are some other consensus algorithms (how they work is not important for now): Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), Proof-of-Authority (PoA), Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT), etc.\n\n* * *\n\n## Ways to make it better\n\n[Permalink: Ways to make it better](https://github.com/memoakten/eco-nft#ways-to-make-it-better)\n\nHere are just some of the ways to improve the carbon footprint of NFTs:\n\n### Still using Ethereum:\n\n[Permalink: Still using Ethereum:](https://github.com/memoakten/eco-nft#still-using-ethereum)\n\n- **Lazy minting**: This is not necessarily dramatically better, around 2x, or maybe 3x less carbon footprint. This is done by not creating an NFT until its first purchase.\n- **Sidechains**: NFTs are minted on non-Ethereum PoS sidechains, but can be moved onto Ethereum later. If they are not moved, can be hundreds times more efficient.\n- **Bridges**: Are specifically for making one blockchain ecosystem compatible with another blockchain. This can also be referred to as interoperability and allows chains to interact which otherwise cannot. The advantage of this is you can go from ETH to another less impactful chain without loosing the data minted.\n- **Various Layer 2 (L2) scaling optimizations**: Can be up to 100x more efficient.\n\n### Using other blockchains:\n\n[Permalink: Using other blockchains:](https://github.com/memoakten/eco-nft#using-other-blockchains)\n\n- Instead of Ethereum, other blockchains are used. This can be up to hundreds of times better for the environment in terms of carbon footprint. Some of these chains include Algorand, Tezos, Polkadot, Hedera Hashgraph, and other PoS networks.\n\n* * *\n\n## NFT Platforms & Marketplaces\n\n[Permalink: NFT Platforms & Marketplaces](https://github.com/memoakten/eco-nft#nft-platforms--marketplaces)\n\nThese are the websites that you would use to upload, ‘mint’ and sell your works.\nFor sake of simplicity, we can say that from an ecological perspective, Ethereum (which uses PoW), is the worst (unless sidechains or L2 scaling is implemented).\n\nPlatforms using different blockchains (e.g. using PoS, PoA etc) will generally be hundreds times more efficient. For those wishing to not incur the immense footprints of Ethereum, look for - and support - alternatives. Sales may be lower for now (see the **Risks** section at the end). This document doesn’t aim to give advice, instead it is a **first step** in collecting this information in one place.\n\nHopefully if there is enough demand for **sustainable and transparent platforms**, this can encourage developers, investors and collectors to invest in and develop these more ecologically friendly alternatives and grow the market. (And hopefully the community can provide more feedback - perhaps in the [issues](https://github.com/memo/eco-nft/issues)).\n\n### Eco-friendly\n\n[Permalink: Eco-friendly](https://github.com/memoakten/eco-nft#eco-friendly)\n\n#### hic et nunc - open marketplace for digital art\n\n[Permalink: hic et nunc - open marketplace for digital art](https://github.com/memoakten/eco-nft#hic-et-nunc---open-marketplace-for-digital-art)\n\n- [https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/)\n- Blockchain: **Tezos** (XTZ)\n- Open application (not invite only or curated)\n- Note: The original Hic et Nunc (aka HEN) site is discontinued.

E.g. if you sell a NFT for 1 ETH, which is currently worth ~$1600, the value of ETH could later drop to a few hundred $ in a few months, or even in a few weeks (alternatively, it could rise to two or three thousand $$ too).\n- This becomes potentially even more risky (or potentially more rewarding) with cryptocurrencies that have a much smaller market cap (e.g. NEAR, XTZ, AVAX etc), which could die and drop to zero (or go to the moon) in a few weeks.\n- Please act responsibly. Seek financial advice if need be (preferably not from YouTube, TikTok, Elon Musk or Chamath Palihapitiya).\n- The smaller blockchains are likely to have fewer collectors. So expect smaller sales on these platforms. (Though as more people start to use these blockchains for NFTs the prices will likely rise with demand).\n\n* * *\n\n## Acknowledgements & Contributions\n\n[Permalink: Acknowledgements & Contributions](https://github.com/memoakten/eco-nft#acknowledgements--contributions)\n\nThe information in this document is a collective effort from many people including:\n\nMemo Akten, Primavera De Filippi, Joanie Lemercier, Addie Wagenknecht, Mat Dryhurst, Sutu\\_eats\\_flies, everybody in the [\"Clean-NFTs\" discord \\[5\\]](https://discord.com/invite/X2BefZVtWh)\nand many more.\n(Also see [https://github.com/memo/eco-nft/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/memo/eco-nft/graphs/contributors) )\n\nPlease submit a [pull-request](https://github.com/memo/eco-nft/pulls) or [issue](https://github.com/memo/eco-nft/issues) if you would like to make any changes or have any comments.\n\nPull requests:\n\n- Small and atomic (i.e. each pull request should be a change to one location, and in a separate branch if need be)\n- Please don’t send pull-requests which change whitespace or line-endings etc\n\n* * *\n\n## References\n\n[Permalink: References](https://github.com/memoakten/eco-nft#references)\n\n1.

Game is a work in progress and subject to change at any time.\n\n# Introduction to the Negation Game\n\n[Permalink: Introduction to the Negation Game](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#introduction-to-the-negation-game)\n\n## What is the Negation Game?\n\n[Permalink: What is the Negation Game?](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#what-is-the-negation-game)\n\n> A protocol layer for reasoned disagreement: powered by economic incentives, governed by epistemic values, and designed for minds willing to change.\n\nThe Negation Game is a discussion platform built on principles of epistemic accountability and honest intellectual discourse. Unlike traditional discussion platforms that rely solely on upvotes or likes, the Negation Game implements a sophisticated system of economic incentives designed to reward intellectual honesty, evidence-based reasoning, and the willingness to change one's mind when presented with compelling counterevidence.\n\nAt its core, the Negation Game is an implementation of epistocratic principles, creating a mechanism where users stake their reputation on claims and are rewarded for intellectual integrity rather than stubborn commitment to potentially false beliefs.\n\nYou can find the live site [here](https://negationgame.com/).\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n[Permalink: Key Concepts](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#key-concepts)\n\n### Points and Negations\n\n[Permalink: Points and Negations](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#points-and-negations)\n\n- **Points**: These are statements or arguments that users make in the system. When you make a point, you're essentially putting forward a claim or position.\n\n- **Negations**: These are counterarguments to points. A negation challenges a point directly, creating a paired relationship between the original point and its counterevidence. You can endorse your negation while creating it.\n\n\n### Cred and Favor\n\n[Permalink: Cred and Favor](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#cred-and-favor)\n\n- **Cred**: The primary resource in the system. Each user starts with a fixed allocation of Cred, which acts like a delegation power. You spend Cred to endorse Points and place Doubts; Restakes and Slashes do not cost additional Cred. When you Doubt, your earnings accumulate passively from the favor bonus until the Restaker Slashes, which cuts off further earnings. Use the \"Collect Earnings\" button in your profile to redeem any accumulated earnings. You must check in on it regularly to collect your earnings or you may miss out if the Restaker Slashes.\n\n- **Favor**: A measure of how much the community believes in a Point. It's calculated based on the point/negation Cred ratio and is boosted by Restakes, but reduced by Slashes and Doubts.\n\n\n### Rationales\n\n[Permalink: Rationales](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#rationales)\n\n- **Rationales**: These are structured collections of Points and Negations that represent complete arguments. They allow users to create and share comprehensive reasoning structures rather than isolated points.\n\n### Spaces\n\n[Permalink: Spaces](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#spaces)\n\nSpaces are separate communities or contexts within the Negation Game. Each space can have its own focus, culture, and set of discussions:\n\n- **Global Space**: The default space where all users can participate\n- **Specialized Spaces**: Topic, community, or DAO-specific spaces\n\nEach space has its own feed of Points, Negations, and Rationales, allowing communities to develop focused conversations around their specific interests or domains.\n\n## Advanced Mechanisms\n\n[Permalink: Advanced Mechanisms](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#advanced-mechanisms)\n\n### The Commitment Mechanism: Restakes, Slashes, and Doubts\n\n[Permalink: The Commitment Mechanism: Restakes, Slashes, and Doubts](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#the-commitment-mechanism-restakes-slashes-and-doubts)\n\n**Restaking**, **Slashing**, and **Doubting** form the system's commitment mechanisms with distinct Cred implications:\n\n- **Restaking**: Commit to reconsider your endorsement if a specific negation proves true. Restaking does not cost additional Cred; it allocates a portion of your existing Cred endorsed to the parent Point and grants a favor bonus to the parent Point. This bonus is at risk and can be claimed by Doubters until you Slash.\n- **Slashing**: Fulfill your Restake commitment by acknowledging the negation changed your mind. Slashing costs no additional Cred, removes the favor bonus, and you earn Cred based on the conditions you committed to.\n- **Doubting**: Bet against a Restaker's likelihood of Slashing. Doubting costs Cred to place; if the Restaker does not Slash when expected, you win your Doubt and earn Cred, redeemable via the \"Collect Earnings\" button. If they Slash, you lose your Doubted Cred.\n\n## How to Use the Negation Game\n\n[Permalink: How to Use the Negation Game](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#how-to-use-the-negation-game)\n\n### Getting Started\n\n[Permalink: Getting Started](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#getting-started)\n\n1. **Connect your account**: Use the connect button to authenticate. You can link your wallet, email, Google Account, or Farcaster.\n2. **Explore the feed**: Browse existing points and negations in your chosen space. Use the search feature to find specific content.\n3. **Make a point**: Create your first statement to start participating\n4. **Use the AI Assistant**: Navigate to the Chat tab to ask questions, generate points, and explore rationales with the built-in AI Assistant.\n\n### Basic Interactions\n\n[Permalink: Basic Interactions](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#basic-interactions)\n\n- **Endorse a point**: When you see a Point you agree with, you can endorse it with Cred\n- **Negate a point**: Create a counterargument to challenge an existing Point\n- **Create a rationale**: Organize multiple Points and Negations into a structured argument\n\n### Complex Interactions\n\n[Permalink: Complex Interactions](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#complex-interactions)\n\n- **Restake on a point**: Show your conviction by committing to change your mind if a negation proves true\n- **Slash your restake**: Acknowledge when a negation has changed your mind\n- **Doubt a restake**: Challenge someone's commitment to intellectual honesty\n\n## The Economic Game\n\n[Permalink: The Economic Game](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#the-economic-game)\n\nThe Negation Game creates a system where:\n\n1. Making strong claims without evidence is risky\n2. Being willing to change your mind is rewarded\n3. Intellectual honesty has real economic benefits\n4. Deep, evidence-based discussions are incentivized\n\nBy aligning economic incentives with epistemic values, the Negation Game creates an environment where the truth-seeking process itself becomes the core activity, rather than merely winning arguments.\n\n## Theoretical Foundations\n\n[Permalink: Theoretical Foundations](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#theoretical-foundations)\n\nThe Negation Game implements principles from epistocracy, which improves upon futarchy by:\n\n1. Integrating information dissemination directly into the market mechanism\n2. Making the reasons for beliefs transparent and disputable\n3. Creating economic incentives for revealing information that might falsify your own position\n4. Establishing a recursive system where claims can be examined at increasing levels of nuance\n5. Rewarding those who demonstrate willingness to change their minds based on evidence\n\nThe result is a discussion platform where the quality of your reasoning and your intellectual integrity matter more than merely holding popular opinions or having the most followers.\n\nBy participating in the Negation Game, you're joining a community dedicated to better collective reasoning, intellectual honesty, and the pursuit of truth through structured, incentive-aligned dialogue.\n\n## Running the project locally\n\n[Permalink: Running the project locally](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#running-the-project-locally)\n\nNegation Game is not intended to be run locally. It is a hosted service.\n\nHowever, if you would like to attempt to run it locally, you can do so by following these steps:\n\n1. Clone the repository\n2. Install dependencies `pnpm i`\n3. Run the development server using `pnpm dev`\n\nThe repository makes several assumptions about the environment it's running in.\n\n- It assumes that you are using postgre, privy for authentication, as well as Gemini and OpenAI for AI features.\n\n### Running the Yjs websocket server\n\n[Permalink: Running the Yjs websocket server](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#running-the-yjs-websocket-server)\n\nThe Negation Game uses Yjs for collaborative editing. The Yjs websocket server is hosted on Fly.io.\n\n`cd yjs-ws && ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3001 VERBOSE=1 node server.js` is for local development.\n\n## Contributing\n\n[Permalink: Contributing](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#contributing)\n\nWe welcome contributions to the Negation Game! We have a rough roadmap for the project [here](https://github.com/orgs/network-goods-institute/projects/1/views/1).\n\nFeel free to open an issue or a PR! Negation Game is being actively developed, so there are plenty of opportunities to contribute.\n\n## License\n\n[Permalink: License](https://github.com/network-goods-institute/negation-game#license)\n\nNegation Game is licensed under the MIT License.

There are a number of use cases including\n\n1. Coallition building\n2. Enabling metagoverance\n3. Diversifying a treasury\n\nmetaDAOs can also be used in conjunction with fundraising projects to allow a group of DAOs to package themselves as somewhat of an index - thereby increasing fundraising opportunities.\n\nPlease join us and contribute your use cases, questions, and degen DAO leadership:\n\n[https://discord.gg/2atZxZhRSK](https://discord.gg/2atZxZhRSK)\n\n## Technologies\n\n[Permalink: Technologies](https://github.com/not-that-metaDAO#technologies)\n\nmetaDAO technologies include the MTOTM project and the metaDAO user interface.\n\nMTOTM stands for Many to One to Many atomic swap. The underlying smart contracts enable many token owners to swap tokens at a fixed ratio in return for an equal share of governance tokens in a newly created metaDAO.\n\nThe following animation shows an example where, on the right side, independent contributors obtain metaDAO tokens in return for eth. Often a metaDAO will be established without a fundraising component. In the case the swaps and the creation of the metaDAO does not include contributions.\n\n[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d490fa7d27c777fc49cde1178b4d9655fc840acbf7ecfed126b27c1f82ea200b/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f43307479706c742e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d490fa7d27c777fc49cde1178b4d9655fc840acbf7ecfed126b27c1f82ea200b/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f43307479706c742e676966)[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d490fa7d27c777fc49cde1178b4d9655fc840acbf7ecfed126b27c1f82ea200b/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f43307479706c742e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d490fa7d27c777fc49cde1178b4d9655fc840acbf7ecfed126b27c1f82ea200b/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f43307479706c742e676966)[Open in new window](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d490fa7d27c777fc49cde1178b4d9655fc840acbf7ecfed126b27c1f82ea200b/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f43307479706c742e676966)\n\n## Use cases for metaDAOs:\n\n[Permalink: Use cases for metaDAOs:](https://github.com/not-that-metaDAO#use-cases-for-metadaos)\n\nAs mentioned above, there are at least a few emergent use cases for metaDAOs.\n\n### Coalition building:\n\n[Permalink: Coalition building:](https://github.com/not-that-metaDAO#coalition-building)\n\nDAOs themselves can be composable elements much as protocols themselves can be. We already see the emergent of subDAOs. metaDAOs are conceptually similar - though in the opposite direction.\n\nOne motivation for DAOs joining a metaDAO is to create a coalition of DAOs that have a shared purpose. For example, coallitions that share common approaches to addressing climate change, and yet are each based in a different ecosystem, may choose to create a metaDAO so that they can more easily share what they are doing while retaining their autonomy and decentralization as multiple DAOs.\n\n### Enabling metagovernance:\n\n[Permalink: Enabling metagovernance:](https://github.com/not-that-metaDAO#enabling-metagovernance)\n\nWhile meta governance is often recognized as valuable with DAOs such as Wildfire focused on delivering meta governance across the web3 ecosystem, to date there has not been a widely accepted way to provide incentives for this metagoverance.\n\nThe metaDAO primitive can be used to build meta governance into a group of DAOs from their creation. The DAO created by MTOTM - the metaDAO - itself will have small voting rights across the entire group of member DAOs that comprise the metaDAO. Through the governance of the metaDAO stewards can be elected from the member DAOs themselves or potentially from an organizer of the metaDAO or a meta governance DAO or elsewhere. These stewards would then be able to have votes delegated to them, both from other metaDAO members and from other holders of the member DAOs tokens, increasing their voice.\n\n### Diversification:\n\n[Permalink: Diversification:](https://github.com/not-that-metaDAO#diversification)\n\nEvery founder - and DAO - and many investors as well - eventually learn the value of diversification.\n\nEarly stage technology development is risky. And while every founder, and every DAO, is confident in their ability to become successful, most will not achieve their objects.\n\nStudies suggest that less than 20% of early stage venture investments, for example generate positive returns. Successful investors have been able to invest across enough early stage projects to achieve outsized returns. Founders, and DAOs, however, typically have not.\n\nThe results of this lack of diversification often show up years later. Founders look back on years of effort and may have little financial return to show for their efforts. Similarly, even DAOs that progress enough to issue a tradable token may find that their treasuries are almost entirely valued based on the day to day or hour to hour sentiment of token holders.\n\nmetaDAOs provide founders and DAOs diversification, so that they are more resilient irrespective of immediate sentiment. The same approach can make it easier for contributors to DAOs to spread their investments across many DAOs without the cost and effort of having to individually assemble a similar portfolio.\n\n### Governance options:\n\n[Permalink: Governance options:](https://github.com/not-that-metaDAO#governance-options)\n\nThere are a number of approaches that metaDAOs to establish their own governance. And the establishment of this governance is important because at creation the metaDAO will have certain responsibilities that need to be governed including:\n\n- securing a shared treasury\n- providing supporting services to member DAOs including meta governance\n\nWe intend to gather governance options into a simple structure that metaDAOs can select as they are created, incorporating options such as token weighted voting, the selection of operational stewards, oversight structures and tools such as steward report cards, and the use of non transferrable tokens to create an optional bicammeral structure.\n\n* * *\n\n## Appendix and FAQ\n\n[Permalink: Appendix and FAQ](https://github.com/not-that-metaDAO#appendix-and-faq)\n\nCommonly asked questions include:\n\n1. How atomic is the collective transaction?\n2. Could a metaDAO formation be orchestrated that as long as 5 out of 6 for example DAOs do send their tokens in a given time, the metaDAO will be created and otherwise it will be reverted?\n3. Who decides whether a metaDAO will decide to rebalance, for example shifting the ratios of the DAOs for fundraising or other purposes?\n\n## Popular repositories   Loading\n\n1.

Repository files navigation\n\n| description |\n| --- |\n| A template for DAO governance documentation |\n\n# 🔏 DAO State Repository Template\n\n[Permalink: 🔏 DAO State Repository Template](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#-dao-state-repository-template)\n\nA template for documenting DAO governance through version-controlled, transparent workflows.\n\n_This template is meant to serve as a starting place for developing your organization's governance documentation. You should copy this template and customize it to suit your organization's unique context._\n\n## What is a DAO State Repository?\n\n[Permalink: What is a DAO State Repository?](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#what-is-a-dao-state-repository)\n\nA DAO State Repository serves as the canonical source of truth for governance within a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Unlike traditional documentation that often becomes outdated or scattered across platforms, this centralized approach provides a transparent history of all governance decisions and documents. Members gain equal access to information about how the organization operates, makes decisions, and evolves over time.\n\nThe repository creates a complete governance ecosystem with transparent records of decisions, clear pathways for participation, and accountability for treasury management. By structuring governance information within a version-controlled system, DAOs can build institutional memory while maintaining flexibility for future evolution.\n\n## Git-Based Governance\n\n[Permalink: Git-Based Governance](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#git-based-governance)\n\nUsing git as the foundation for DAO governance documentation aligns naturally with decentralized principles. This approach leverages git's inherent properties to create governance systems that mirror blockchain technology's values.\n\nGit provides an ideal infrastructure for governance with its distributed nature allowing multiple participants to maintain complete history copies. Its transparency makes all changes visible and attributable, while immutability ensures historical records remain unaltered without detection. The branch-based collaboration model enables proposal processes that naturally align with governance workflows.\n\nFor DAOs with on-chain operations, this repository bridges smart contract actions with their human-readable context. This connection maintains alignment between technical implementations and their intended purposes, providing context that blockchain transactions alone cannot express.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n[Permalink: Getting Started](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#getting-started)\n\n### Setup\n\n[Permalink: Setup](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#setup)\n\nThe simplest way to use this template is through GitHub:\n\n1. Click the \"Use this template\" button on GitHub\n2. Name your repository (recommended: `governance`)\n3. Replace all instances of `<daoName>` with your organization's name\n4. Set appropriate access permissions for contributors\n\nIf you prefer command line setup, clone the repository and initialize it manually:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template.git governance\ncd governance\n# Configure your remote repository and push your initial commit\n```\n\n### Repository Structure\n\n[Permalink: Repository Structure](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#repository-structure)\n\nThe template organizes governance documentation into three main sections:\n\n**Agreements** contain commitments between participants including codes of conduct, community guidelines, and operating agreements. These documents establish the foundation for community interactions and decision-making.\n\n**Policies** house procedures and standards for various activities, organized into administrative, operational, and metagovernance categories. These formalize how the organization operates day-to-day.\n\n**Archives** maintain historical records including past proposals and approvals, providing institutional memory and accountability.\n\n## File Disposition Guide\n\n[Permalink: File Disposition Guide](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#file-disposition-guide)\n\nThis template contains several types of files, each serving a different purpose during implementation. This guide will help you understand what to do with each file type when deploying for your organization.\n\n### Files to Customize and Keep\n\n[Permalink: Files to Customize and Keep](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#files-to-customize-and-keep)\n\nThese files form the core of your governance documentation:\n\n- **index.md files** \\- Navigation pages for your members. Customize these with your organization's specific information.\n- **constitution.md** \\- Replace the template content with your organization's foundational principles.\n- **governance.md** \\- Adapt to reflect your documentation management processes.\n- **Agreement files** \\- (code\\_of\\_conduct.md, community\\_guidelines.md, operating\\_agreement.md): Customize with your organization's specific agreements.\n- **Policy directories** \\- Populate with your organization's specific policies.\n\n### Files to Either Customize or Remove\n\n[Permalink: Files to Either Customize or Remove](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#files-to-either-customize-or-remove)\n\nThese files may or may not be relevant to your deployed documentation:\n\n- **README.md** \\- Either replace with your organization-specific content or rename to something more appropriate for your members.\n- **contributing.md** \\- Either customize to reflect your technical contribution guidelines or remove if not needed.\n\n### Files to Remove\n\n[Permalink: Files to Remove](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#files-to-remove)\n\nThese files are only for implementation guidance and should be removed from your production deployment:\n\n- **All readme.md files** \\- These contain implementation guidance only and should be removed when deploying.\n- **Template instructions** \\- Any sections marked with customization comments should be replaced with your content.\n\n### Platform-Specific Deployment\n\n[Permalink: Platform-Specific Deployment](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#platform-specific-deployment)\n\n#### GitHub Pages\n\n[Permalink: GitHub Pages](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#github-pages)\n\nFor GitHub Pages deployment:\n\n- Keep the structure as is, with index.md files serving as landing pages for each directory.\n\n#### GitBook\n\n[Permalink: GitBook](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#gitbook)\n\nFor GitBook deployment:\n\n1. Rename the root index.md to SUMMARY.md\n2. Rename all other index.md files to readme.md\n3. Delete the existing readme.md files first to avoid conflicts\n\n## Customization Guide\n\n[Permalink: Customization Guide](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#customization-guide)\n\nAfter initial setup, begin customizing the repository to reflect your organization's specific governance model. Start by updating the essential files including README.md, operating agreements, and metagovernance policies. Remove all template instruction blocks and replace example text with your actual content.\n\n### Content Customization\n\n[Permalink: Content Customization](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#content-customization)\n\nWhen customizing the repository structure, maintain consistent document organization with clear relationships between different documentation types. Use standard formatting for headers, sections, and examples. Connect related documents through relative paths and section anchors for easy navigation.\n\nFor effective integration with your organization's operations, link documentation to external tools and discussion forums. Document how governance decisions flow to implementation and how responsibilities transition between stakeholders.\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\n[Permalink: Implementation Strategy](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#implementation-strategy)\n\nA phased approach to customization works best:\n\nBegin with initial setup focusing on basic identification and essential documents. Develop core documentation with fundamental agreements and policies. Extend the structure with additional categories and specialized documents as needed. Integrate with existing tools and workflows. Continuously refine documentation based on actual usage.\n\nWhen developing your governance documentation, prioritize discoverability by making important documents easy to find. Maintain consistency in naming and organization patterns. Ensure completeness by including all necessary governance information. Clarify document purposes and relationships. Design for future adaptation as your organization evolves.\n\n## Resources & Credits\n\n[Permalink: Resources & Credits](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#resources--credits)\n\n- Based on the [All In For Sport DAO State](https://state.allinforsport.org/)\n- Inspired by the [Krause House Governance State Repository](https://github.com/Krause-House/org)\n- Created by [rathermercurial.eth](https://rathermercurial.eth.xyz/) as part of the [DAO Primitives Project](https://superbenefit.org/dao-primitive-project) at [SuperBenefit](https://superbenefit.org/)\n\n## License\n\n[Permalink: License](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#license)\n\nThis template is unlicensed and free to use, edit, and distribute as needed.\n\n## About\n\nSimple template for DAO state documentation\n\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#readme-ov-file)\n\n### License\n\n[Unlicense license](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#Unlicense-1-ov-file)\n\n### Contributing\n\n[Contributing](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template#contributing-ov-file)\n\n### Uh oh!\n\nThere was an error while loading.

Repository files navigation\n\n| description |\n| --- |\n| A template for DAO governance documentation |\n\n# 🔏 DAO State Repository Template\n\n[Permalink: 🔏 DAO State Repository Template](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#-dao-state-repository-template)\n\nA template for documenting DAO governance through version-controlled, transparent workflows.\n\n_This template is meant to serve as a starting place for developing your organization's governance documentation. You should copy this template and customize it to suit your organization's unique context._\n\n## What is a DAO State Repository?\n\n[Permalink: What is a DAO State Repository?](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#what-is-a-dao-state-repository)\n\nA DAO State Repository serves as the canonical source of truth for governance within a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Unlike traditional documentation that often becomes outdated or scattered across platforms, this centralized approach provides a transparent history of all governance decisions and documents. Members gain equal access to information about how the organization operates, makes decisions, and evolves over time.\n\nThe repository creates a complete governance ecosystem with transparent records of decisions, clear pathways for participation, and accountability for treasury management. By structuring governance information within a version-controlled system, DAOs can build institutional memory while maintaining flexibility for future evolution.\n\n## Git-Based Governance\n\n[Permalink: Git-Based Governance](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#git-based-governance)\n\nUsing git as the foundation for DAO governance documentation aligns naturally with decentralized principles. This approach leverages git's inherent properties to create governance systems that mirror blockchain technology's values.\n\nGit provides an ideal infrastructure for governance with its distributed nature allowing multiple participants to maintain complete history copies. Its transparency makes all changes visible and attributable, while immutability ensures historical records remain unaltered without detection. The branch-based collaboration model enables proposal processes that naturally align with governance workflows.\n\nFor DAOs with on-chain operations, this repository bridges smart contract actions with their human-readable context. This connection maintains alignment between technical implementations and their intended purposes, providing context that blockchain transactions alone cannot express.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n[Permalink: Getting Started](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#getting-started)\n\n### Setup\n\n[Permalink: Setup](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#setup)\n\nThe simplest way to use this template is through GitHub:\n\n1. Click the \"Use this template\" button on GitHub\n2. Name your repository (recommended: `governance`)\n3. Replace all instances of `<daoName>` with your organization's name\n4. Set appropriate access permissions for contributors\n\nIf you prefer command line setup, clone the repository and initialize it manually:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template.git governance\ncd governance\n# Configure your remote repository and push your initial commit\n```\n\n### Repository Structure\n\n[Permalink: Repository Structure](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#repository-structure)\n\nThe template organizes governance documentation into three main sections:\n\n**Agreements** contain commitments between participants including codes of conduct, community guidelines, and operating agreements. These documents establish the foundation for community interactions and decision-making.\n\n**Policies** house procedures and standards for various activities, organized into administrative, operational, and metagovernance categories. These formalize how the organization operates day-to-day.\n\n**Archives** maintain historical records including past proposals and approvals, providing institutional memory and accountability.\n\n## File Disposition Guide\n\n[Permalink: File Disposition Guide](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#file-disposition-guide)\n\nThis template contains several types of files, each serving a different purpose during implementation. This guide will help you understand what to do with each file type when deploying for your organization.\n\n### Files to Customize and Keep\n\n[Permalink: Files to Customize and Keep](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#files-to-customize-and-keep)\n\nThese files form the core of your governance documentation:\n\n- **index.md files** \\- Navigation pages for your members. Customize these with your organization's specific information.\n- **constitution.md** \\- Replace the template content with your organization's foundational principles.\n- **governance.md** \\- Adapt to reflect your documentation management processes.\n- **Agreement files** \\- (code\\_of\\_conduct.md, community\\_guidelines.md, operating\\_agreement.md): Customize with your organization's specific agreements.\n- **Policy directories** \\- Populate with your organization's specific policies.\n\n### Files to Either Customize or Remove\n\n[Permalink: Files to Either Customize or Remove](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#files-to-either-customize-or-remove)\n\nThese files may or may not be relevant to your deployed documentation:\n\n- **README.md** \\- Either replace with your organization-specific content or rename to something more appropriate for your members.\n- **contributing.md** \\- Either customize to reflect your technical contribution guidelines or remove if not needed.\n\n### Files to Remove\n\n[Permalink: Files to Remove](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#files-to-remove)\n\nThese files are only for implementation guidance and should be removed from your production deployment:\n\n- **All readme.md files** \\- These contain implementation guidance only and should be removed when deploying.\n- **Template instructions** \\- Any sections marked with customization comments should be replaced with your content.\n\n### Platform-Specific Deployment\n\n[Permalink: Platform-Specific Deployment](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#platform-specific-deployment)\n\n#### GitHub Pages\n\n[Permalink: GitHub Pages](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#github-pages)\n\nFor GitHub Pages deployment:\n\n- Keep the structure as is, with index.md files serving as landing pages for each directory.\n\n#### GitBook\n\n[Permalink: GitBook](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#gitbook)\n\nFor GitBook deployment:\n\n1. Rename the root index.md to SUMMARY.md\n2. Rename all other index.md files to readme.md\n3. Delete the existing readme.md files first to avoid conflicts\n\n## Customization Guide\n\n[Permalink: Customization Guide](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#customization-guide)\n\nAfter initial setup, begin customizing the repository to reflect your organization's specific governance model. Start by updating the essential files including README.md, operating agreements, and metagovernance policies. Remove all template instruction blocks and replace example text with your actual content.\n\n### Content Customization\n\n[Permalink: Content Customization](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#content-customization)\n\nWhen customizing the repository structure, maintain consistent document organization with clear relationships between different documentation types. Use standard formatting for headers, sections, and examples. Connect related documents through relative paths and section anchors for easy navigation.\n\nFor effective integration with your organization's operations, link documentation to external tools and discussion forums. Document how governance decisions flow to implementation and how responsibilities transition between stakeholders.\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\n[Permalink: Implementation Strategy](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#implementation-strategy)\n\nA phased approach to customization works best:\n\nBegin with initial setup focusing on basic identification and essential documents. Develop core documentation with fundamental agreements and policies. Extend the structure with additional categories and specialized documents as needed. Integrate with existing tools and workflows. Continuously refine documentation based on actual usage.\n\nWhen developing your governance documentation, prioritize discoverability by making important documents easy to find. Maintain consistency in naming and organization patterns. Ensure completeness by including all necessary governance information. Clarify document purposes and relationships. Design for future adaptation as your organization evolves.\n\n## Resources & Credits\n\n[Permalink: Resources & Credits](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#resources--credits)\n\n- Based on the [All In For Sport DAO State](https://state.allinforsport.org/)\n- Inspired by the [Krause House Governance State Repository](https://github.com/Krause-House/org)\n- Created by [rathermercurial.eth](https://rathermercurial.eth.xyz/) as part of the [DAO Primitives Project](https://superbenefit.org/dao-primitive-project) at [SuperBenefit](https://superbenefit.org/)\n\n## License\n\n[Permalink: License](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#license)\n\nThis template is unlicensed and free to use, edit, and distribute as needed.\n\n## About\n\nSimple template for DAO state documentation\n\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#readme-ov-file)\n\n### License\n\n[Unlicense license](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/blob/main/LICENSE)\n\n### Contributing\n\n[Contributing](https://github.com/rathermercurial/state-template/tree/refizz/#contributing-ov-file)\n\n### Uh oh!\n\nThere was an error while loading.

This repository serves as the authoritative source for understanding how SuperBenefit organizes itself to create positive-sum outcomes for both participants and the broader ecosystem.\n\n## Our Approach to Governance\n\n[Permalink: Our Approach to Governance](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance#our-approach-to-governance)\n\nSuperBenefit operates on the principle that governance should enable rather than constrain effective coordination. Our governance model reflects this philosophy through minimum viable coordination - creating just enough structure to enable effective collaboration while preserving maximum autonomy for contributors to innovate and adapt their approaches to local contexts.\n\nThis repository embodies SuperBenefit's commitment to transparency and collective stewardship. Every agreement, policy, and decision record contained here represents our community's ongoing effort to align coordination mechanisms with our values. The git-based structure ensures that governance evolution remains participatory, with all changes visible and attributable to community processes rather than individual preferences.\n\n## Repository Architecture\n\n[Permalink: Repository Architecture](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance#repository-architecture)\n\nSuperBenefit's governance documentation organizes around three foundational elements that together create the infrastructure for effective coordination:\n\n- **[Agreements](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance/blob/main/agreements/readme.md)** establish the relational foundation that enables diverse participants to work together productively toward shared outcomes. These documents define how community members, contributors, and collaborators relate to SuperBenefit's mission and to each other. Community agreements create the cultural container for healthy participation, while operational agreements establish the structures through which coordinated work happens. Because agreements form the foundation of trust and mutual accountability, they evolve deliberately through inclusive processes that honor the input of affected participants.\n- **[Policies](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance/blob/main/policies/readme.md)** translate our foundational agreements into practical coordination mechanisms across SuperBenefit's various domains of activity. These frameworks operate with appropriate autonomy—metagovernance policies guide how we make collective decisions, operational policies coordinate work within and between teams, and platform policies ensure our digital infrastructure supports rather than hinders collaboration. Policies evolve more frequently than agreements, allowing SuperBenefit to adapt its coordination patterns as we learn and grow while maintaining alignment with our core commitments.\n- **[Proposals](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance/blob/main/proposals/readme.md)** preserve the institutional memory of how SuperBenefit has developed through collective decision-making. This archive contains not just the outcomes of governance processes but the deliberative context that informed them. By maintaining comprehensive records of proposals, discussions, and implementations, we create accountability mechanisms that enable current and future participants to understand how SuperBenefit's current form emerged from community choices rather than individual visions.\n\n## Engaging with SuperBenefit Governance\n\n[Permalink: Engaging with SuperBenefit Governance](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance#engaging-with-superbenefit-governance)\n\nSuperBenefit welcomes participation from community members at different levels of engagement, recognizing that effective coordination benefits from diverse perspectives and contributions. Whether you're exploring SuperBenefit's approach to organization, contributing to specific initiatives, or helping shape our governance evolution, this repository provides resources to support meaningful participation.\n\n- For newcomers to SuperBenefit, begin with our community [agreements](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance/blob/main/agreements/readme.md) to understand the cultural foundation of our work and how SuperBenefit's mission translates into organizational structure.\n- Active contributors will find detailed guidance in the [policies](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance/blob/main/policies/readme.md) section, organized by domain to support efficient navigation. Understanding the governance frameworks within your areas of contribution enables more effective coordination with other community members while preserving the autonomy necessary for innovative work.\n- Network neighbors can use this knowledge to inspire and inform their own governance evolution. Everything in this repository is free to use, share, modify and distribute as needed. You can use our [DAO state template](https://github.com/superbenefit/state-template) to replicate this repository structure for your own community, network or organizing framework.\n\nThe best way to find help or get involved is to [join our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d2EeszTvVm).\n\n## Contributing to Governance Evolution\n\n[Permalink: Contributing to Governance Evolution](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance#contributing-to-governance-evolution)\n\nSuperBenefit's governance evolves through the active participation of community members who understand that coordination mechanisms must adapt to serve changing circumstances while preserving alignment with our core values. Our governance framework creates multiple pathways for participation, recognizing that different contributors have varying levels of capacity and interest in formal governance processes.\n\nThose interested in participating in governance development can engage through our established proposal processes, which create pathways for community members to suggest improvements to coordination mechanisms while ensuring changes reflect collective wisdom rather than individual preferences. The proposal archive provides valuable context for understanding how similar challenges have been addressed previously, supporting more informed governance development.\n\n[Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance/blob/main/contributing.md)\n\n## Finding Your Way\n\n[Permalink: Finding Your Way](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance#finding-your-way)\n\nKey governance documents can be accessed through the [main navigation](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance/blob/main/index.md), while detailed [policies](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance/blob/main/policies/index.md) are organized by domain to support efficient reference during collaborative work. The [proposal archive](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance/blob/main/proposals/index.md) can be explored chronologically to understand governance evolution or topically to see how specific coordination challenges have been addressed over time.\n\nSuperBenefit's governance succeeds when it becomes a transparent foundation that enables rather than constrains effective work. By maintaining this repository as a living record of our coordination commitments, we create the conditions for effective collaboration that honors both individual autonomy and collective purpose in service of systems that benefit all participants.\n\n## About\n\nThe official state of SuperBenefit governance\n\n\n[governance.superbenefit.org](https://governance.superbenefit.org/ \"https://governance.superbenefit.org\")\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance#readme-ov-file)\n\n### License\n\n[CC0-1.0 license](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance#CC0-1.0-1-ov-file)\n\n### Code of conduct\n\n[Code of conduct](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance#coc-ov-file)\n\n### Contributing\n\n[Contributing](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance#contributing-ov-file)\n\n### Uh oh!\n\nThere was an error while loading.

The DAO Act, underlying smart contracts, certificate of formation, and limited liability company agreement (i.e., the operating agreement), if applicable, of a decentralized autonomous organization may define, reduce, or eliminate fiduciary duties and may restrict the transfer of ownership interests, withdrawal or resignation from the decentralized autonomous organization, return of capital contributions and dissolution of the decentralized autonomous organization._\n\nThis Operating Agreement (\"the Agreement\") of SuperBenefit DAO LLC, a non-profit limited liability company (the \"Company\") incorporated as per the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands pursuant to the Marshall Islands Limited Liability Company Act of 1996 (as amended, the \"LLC Act\"), the Marshall Islands Non-Profit Entities (Amendment) Act of 2021 (as amended, the \"Non-Profit Act\"), the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act (as amended, the \"BCA\") and the Decentralized Autonomous Organization Act, 2022 (as amended, the \"DAO Act\"), by and among the Company and the persons executing this Agreement (individually \"Member\" and collectively \"Members\"), causing the filing of the certificate of formation of the Company (the \"Certificate of Formation\"), with the Marshall Islands Registrar of Corporations shall be effective as of the date of the issuance of the Certificate of Formation (\"the Effective Date\"). Capitalized terms have the same meaning as those defined in the relevant law.\n\n**WHEREAS**, in pursuit of compliance with a fit-for-purpose legal regime that seeks to protect members and support innovation, the Members of the Company approved the incorporation of the Company as a Marshall Islands non-profit limited liability company and decentralized autonomous organization.\n\n**NOW, THEREFORE**, for and in consideration of mutual covenants contained and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:\n\n## ARTICLE I - ORGANIZATION\n\n[Permalink: ARTICLE I - ORGANIZATION](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance/blob/main/agreements/dao/operating-agreement.md#article-i---organization)\n\nI.1 **Organization.** The Members hereby agree to organize as a Marshall Islands non-profit, member-managed decentralized autonomous organization limited liability company (\"DAO LLC\") pursuant to the provisions of the DAO Act, the LLC Act, the Non-Profit Act and the BCA upon the terms set forth in this Agreement.\n\nI.2 **Decentralized Autonomous Organization.** The Company is a decentralized autonomous organization within the meaning of §102(c) and §104(1) and (3) of the DAO Act, whereby the notice of restrictions on duties and transfers appears conspicuously at the beginning of this Agreement.\n\nI.3 **Registered Office; Registered Agent.** The registered office of the Company in the Marshall Islands shall be the initial registered office designated in the Certificate of Formation or such other office as provided by law.

The Company shall maintain a Digital Infrastructure Policy in the DAO State that establishes official online venues, repository management procedures, and public access protocols. All governance activities shall utilize the digital infrastructure established in such policy. For purposes of this Agreement, \"DAO State\" refers to the Company's comprehensive governance repository containing all agreements, policies, proposal archives, and related documentation that constitute the current state of the Company's governance framework.\n\nI.5 **Term.** The Company shall commence upon the date of the filing of the Certificate of Formation and shall continue in existence until dissolved pursuant to this Agreement.\n\nI.6 **Relationship to SuperBenefit Community.** The Company exists as a distinct governance body within the broader SuperBenefit network and shall maintain operational separation from the SuperBenefit community. The Company shall participate in governance coordination with other bodies within the SuperBenefit network, including the SuperBenefit Community and coordination bodies as established in this Agreement. This organizational structure shall:\n\nA. Enable the Company to maintain exclusive authority over business operations while the SuperBenefit Community retains autonomous authority over cultural and social matters;\n\nB. Permit persons who participate in SuperBenefit community activities but who are not Members of the Company to engage in such activities without thereby incurring liability for or legal association with the Company's business operations;\n\nC. Provide for the Company to receive specified rights and benefits through agreements with the SuperBenefit Community, which rights may include but are not limited to trademark and brand usage, access to community platforms, and participation in community support systems, all as may be established through governance agreements between the respective bodies;\n\nD. Establish coordination mechanisms through onchain governance infrastructure that enables shared governance authority among the various bodies within the SuperBenefit network.\n\n## ARTICLE II - PURPOSES AND POWERS\n\n[Permalink: ARTICLE II - PURPOSES AND POWERS](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance/blob/main/agreements/dao/operating-agreement.md#article-ii---purposes-and-powers)\n\nII.1 **Nonprofit Character.** The Company shall be a non-profit entity within the meaning of the Non-Profit Act and may exercise the powers and privileges conferred upon limited liability companies by the laws of the Marshall Islands only in furtherance of and subject to its company purpose.\n\nII.2 **Purposes of the Company.** To research and incubate initiatives that harness emerging technologies and practices in pursuit of systems transformation.\n\nII.3 **Authority of the Company.** The Company shall have and exercise all of the powers and authority conferred by Marshall Islands law on an entity recognized as a decentralized autonomous organization limited liability company with non-profit status, and insofar as this entity form is recognized by foreign laws as a legal person separate and distinct from its Members, then the Company shall also have all of the powers and authority as conferred by those foreign laws.\n\nII.4 **No Private Inurement.** No part of its assets, income, or earnings shall inure to the benefit of, or be distributable to, any person or individual, including a Member or non-Member or any private individual of the Company, during the life or upon dissolution of the Company, except:\n\nA. In accordance with the advancement of the Company's purpose;\nB. So that reasonable compensation may be paid for services rendered to or for the Company advancing its purpose; and\nC. For reimbursement of expenses incurred on behalf of the Company for advancing its purpose where the Company has provided prior approval of the amount and nature of expenses to be reimbursed and to whom.\n\nII.5 **Limitation of Non-Profit Activities.** In accordance with the Non-Profit Act, the Company maintains non-profit status if it exclusively engages in raising or disbursing funds for charitable, religious, scientific, educational, social, fraternal, or any other types of \"good works\" if:\n\nA. No part of the net earnings inures to the benefit of any person or individual;\nB. Its activities do not exclusively involve disseminating propaganda or otherwise attempting to influence legislation; and\nC. It does not participate in, intervene in, or disseminate statements on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate running for public office.\n\nThe Company shall never be operated for the primary purpose of carrying on a trade or business for profit.\n\n## ARTICLE III - MEMBERS\n\n[Permalink: ARTICLE III - MEMBERS](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance/blob/main/agreements/dao/operating-agreement.md#article-iii---members)\n\nIII.1 **Participant Classes.** The Company recognizes two classes of participants:\n\nA. **Cells**: Autonomous teams that carry out SuperBenefit's purpose, which constitute the Company's Members. Cells are identified by ownership of permissioned multisignature wallets, and participate in operational governance through consensus mechanisms established in the DAO State. Technical implementation details for Cell identification shall be specified in the Cell Policy.\n\nB. **Contributors**: Individuals who participate in the Company's activities through Cells. While Contributors do not hold direct Company membership, they exercise collective governance through their Cells. Contributors are identified by Cell-issued role badges and participate in Cell governance as established in the DAO State. Technical implementation details for Contributor identification shall be specified in the Contributor Eligibility Policy.\n\nIII.2 **Eligibility and Accountability.** The Company shall maintain eligibility criteria for all participants through policies in the DAO State. Cells shall ensure their operations and Contributors' conduct comply with applicable Company policies. Contributors remain accountable to their Cells for role performance within Company policy constraints.\n\nIII.3 **Transparency and Documentation.** The Company shall maintain a public directory of Members and transparency requirements in accordance with the DAO Act. All operational policies, formation processes, and accountability structures shall be detailed in the Cell Eligibility Policy, Contributor Eligibility Policy, Cell Policy, and DAO Member Policy in the DAO State.\n\nIII.4 **Voting Rights.** Only Cells exercise voting rights in Company governance. Contributors possess no direct voting rights and participate in governance exclusively through their Cell relationships. Cells shall ensure their contributor eligibility criteria provide Contributors with access to community governance, enabling direct participation in community matters distinct from Company operations. Voting mechanisms, delegation procedures, and decision-making frameworks shall be established in the Voting Policy and Cell Policy in the DAO State.\n\n## ARTICLE IV - RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF MEMBERS\n\n[Permalink: ARTICLE IV - RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF MEMBERS](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance/blob/main/agreements/dao/operating-agreement.md#article-iv---rights-and-duties-of-members)\n\nIV.1 **Management Rights.** All Cell Members who have not Dissociated (as defined in Article VIII) shall be entitled to vote on any matter submitted to a vote of the Members in accordance with the Voting Policy in the DAO State.\n\nIV.2 **Liability of Members.** No Member shall be liable for the liabilities of the Company unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement or any governance rules approved in accordance with this Agreement. The failure of the Company to observe any formalities or requirements relating to the exercise of its powers or management of its business or affairs under this Agreement shall not be grounds for imposing personal liability on the Members for liabilities of the Company.\n\nIV.3 **No fiduciary duties unless expressly approved.** In accordance with §109 of the DAO Act, no Member shall have any fiduciary duty to the Company or any Member unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement or any governance rules approved in accordance with this Agreement.\n\nIV.4 **Good faith and fair dealing.** In accordance with §109 of the DAO Act, Members are subject to the implied contractual covenants of good faith and fair dealing in respect of their interactions with the Company or any Member.\n\nIV.5 **Miscellaneous Obligations.** Each Member shall be duty-bound to act consistently and in compliance with each of the provisions of this Agreement and with all policies, rules, and decisions of the Company adopted in accordance with the DAO State governance framework.\n\n## ARTICLE V - MANAGEMENT\n\n[Permalink: ARTICLE V - MANAGEMENT](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance/blob/main/agreements/dao/operating-agreement.md#article-v---management)\n\nV.1 **Member-Managed.** The Company shall be member-managed. Members shall make decisions through governance processes established in the DAO State, including the Voting Policy and other metagovernance policies. Governance activities carried out by the Members of the Company constitute \"Operational Governance\" for purposes of this Agreement. The General Circle, further defined in Article V.5, serves as a coordination body within Operational Governance.\n\nV.2 **Policy Domains.** The Company's activities shall be organized through policy domains as established in the DAO State. Operational governance has authority over Operational Policies, which govern work coordination, resource allocation, and contributor activities. Operational governance may create sub-domains within Operational Policies and delegate authority to create or update policies within those sub-domains.\n\nV.3 **Authority Delegation.** The Company shall maintain an Authority Delegation Policy in the DAO State that establishes procedures for delegating policy-making authority to the General Circle or other groups. All delegations must remain revocable and subject to Member oversight as established in such policy. Members are bound by the delegation procedures and oversight requirements established in such policy.\n\nV.4 **Authority to Bind Company.** Only Members acting in accordance with the governance processes established in the DAO State shall have the authority to bind the Company. Operational governance may create governance bodies with authority to bind the Company within defined scopes, or delegate such authority to specific roles or entities within particular boundaries. The Authority Delegation Policy in the DAO State shall establish the specific procedures, limitations, and accountability mechanisms for binding the Company.\n\nV.5 **Operational Governance and Delegation.** Operational governance authority is exercised by Cells through consensus mechanisms established in Company policies. Recognizing the coordination requirements of multi-Cell consensus:\n\nA. Operational governance may delegate specific authorities to facilitate effective coordination, as detailed in the Authority Delegation Policy.\n\nB. The General Circle, as established in the General Circle Policy, serves as the default delegate for all operational authorities that are not otherwise delegated or reserved for formal Cell consensus processes. This ensures operational effectiveness while maintaining Member oversight.\n\nC. All delegations remain revocable and subject to Member oversight through mechanisms established in Company policies.\n\n## ARTICLE VI - ACCOUNTING AND RECORDS\n\n[Permalink: ARTICLE VI - ACCOUNTING AND RECORDS](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance/blob/main/agreements/dao/operating-agreement.md#article-vi---accounting-and-records)\n\nVI.1 **Required Records.** The Company shall maintain records as required by the DAO Act and as detailed in the DAO State. The following records shall be kept and maintained for a minimum of five (5) years:\n\nA. A complete list of current and former Members or the mechanism by which membership can be determined;\nB. A copy of the Certificate of Formation and all amendments thereto;\nC. A copy of this Agreement, including all amendments thereto;\nD. The DAO State governance documentation as maintained in the Company's governance repository;\nE. Any meeting minutes, accounting records, and financial statements of the Company;\nF. Records of all governance decisions as maintained in the Proposal Archive within the DAO State.\n\nThe Company shall maintain a Data Management Policy in the DAO State that establishes data collection, retention, privacy protection, and access control procedures. All record keeping and data management activities shall comply with such policy.\n\nVI.2 **No Separate Rights to Access Public Information.** In accordance with §111 of the DAO Act, except for relevant government officials with reasonable grounds to investigate a violation of the laws of the Marshall Islands, no one shall have the right under the LLC Act to demand to separately inspect or copy records of the Company, and it shall have no obligation to furnish any information to anyone concerning its activities, financial condition or other circumstances to the extent the information is publicly available on a distributed ledger or already publicly available such as in the DAO State governance repository.\n\nVI.3 **Public Member Directory.** The Company shall maintain in an obvious and conspicuous location within the DAO State either:\n\nA.

We use a \"digital gardening\" approach, where technical tools support the organic growth of our shared understanding.\n\nOur [public knowledge garden](https://knowledge.superbenefit.org/) shares curated artifacts and insights from this work, while this repository contains the complete workspace where that knowledge develops. This dual nature - private workspace and public garden - enables us to balance open sharing with the messy reality of knowledge development.\n\n### Key Features\n\n[Permalink: Key Features](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base#key-features)\n\n- **Local-First Markdown:** All content is stored as plain markdown files, giving you full control over your data.\n- **Obsidian Integration:** Designed for use with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a powerful knowledge management application.\n- **GitHub Version Control:** Leverages [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control, collaboration, and backup.\n- **Networked Knowledge:** Connects ideas through wiki-links and metadata, creating a rich and interconnected web of knowledge.\n- **Progressive Documentation:** Supports the evolution of knowledge from rough drafts to polished artifacts.\n\n* * *\n\n## Getting Started\n\n[Permalink: Getting Started](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base#getting-started)\n\n1. **Install Obsidian:** [Download Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) and familiarize yourself with its basic features.\n2. **Clone This Repository:**\n\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base.git\ncd knowledge-base\n```\n\n3. **Open as Obsidian Vault:** In Obsidian, select \"Open folder as vault\" and choose the cloned `knowledge-base` directory.\n4. **Configure Obsidian (Recommended):**\n   - Enable \"Automatically update internal links\" in Obsidian settings (inside Options/Files and links).\n5. **Start Exploring:** Browse the repository structure and start exploring the existing content.\n\n### Repository Structure\n\n[Permalink: Repository Structure](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base#repository-structure)\n\n- **[Artifacts](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/artifacts/readme.md)**: Published, refined content that represents our collective understanding. Contains finished research, documentation, and community-validated knowledge.\n- **[Notes](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/notes/readme.md)**: Working documents organized by project. This is where active development happens and where ideas mature through collaboration.\n- **[Drafts](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/drafts/readme.md)**: Private workspace for developing thoughts and initial research. This is where new ideas begin before they're ready for wider collaboration.\n- **[Links](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/links/readme.md)**: External references and resources, enriched with community commentary and analysis.\n- **[Tags](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tags/readme.md)**: Our shared vocabulary and conceptual framework, including term definitions and relationships.\n- **[Tools](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tools/readme.md)**: Knowledge management utilities, including:\n\n  - `templates/`: Standard document structures\n  - `types/`: Metadata schemas and definitions\n- **Attachments**: Media files, images, diagrams, and other supporting content used throughout the knowledge base.\n\n### Documentation\n\n[Permalink: Documentation](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base#documentation)\n\nEach directory contains two types of documentation to serve different audiences:\n\n- **README Files (e.g., `artifacts/readme.md`):** These files are primarily for contributors and knowledge managers working directly with the repository. They provide information on the directory's purpose, how to contribute, and any specific guidelines for that area. They are \"inner-facing\" documentation.\n- **Folder Notes (e.g., `artifacts/artifacts.md`):** These files are equivalent to index files and are published to the SuperBenefit Knowledge Garden to be displayed publicly. They provide an overview of the directory's content and guide readers on how to use and get the most value from the resources within. Folder notes always have the _same name as their parent directory_ (e.g., the folder note for `/artifacts` is `/artifacts/artifacts.md`).

Unlike simple editing which focuses primarily on correctness and style, refizzing involves a more holistic transformation that considers the end user's needs, the broader context, and the ultimate purpose of the information. This practice acknowledges that knowledge creation is iterative and that initial documentation often benefits from focused refinement to reach its full potential.\n\nThe concept embodies the spirit of continuous improvement that characterizes effective knowledge communities. By normalizing and celebrating the refizzing process, organizations create a culture where ideas are allowed to evolve through collaboration rather than emerging fully-formed. This approach reduces barriers to initial contribution while ensuring that collective intelligence can be applied to enhance and clarify information over time, resulting in knowledge assets that benefit from diverse perspectives and experiences.\n\n* * *\n\n## Uses of \"Refizz\"\n\n[Permalink: Uses of \"Refizz\"](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tags/refizz.md#uses-of-refizz)\n\n### Refizz in Knowledge Management\n\n[Permalink: Refizz in Knowledge Management](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tags/refizz.md#refizz-in-knowledge-management)\n\nIn knowledge management contexts, refizzing describes the process of revisiting and improving documentation to increase its clarity, accessibility, and usefulness. This often involves synthesizing complex information, adding missing context, reorganizing content structures, or simplifying language to make knowledge more approachable for its intended audience.\n\nKnowledge workers use refizzing to transform initial brain dumps, meeting notes, or technical documentation into more structured and accessible resources. The practice acknowledges that first drafts rarely serve all needs effectively and that deliberate refinement creates significantly more value from existing information assets.\n\n### Refizz in Collaborative Documentation\n\n[Permalink: Refizz in Collaborative Documentation](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tags/refizz.md#refizz-in-collaborative-documentation)\n\nWithin collaborative teams and communities, refizzing serves as a community practice where members improve each other's contributions without diminishing the value of initial documentation efforts. This collaborative approach to refinement allows specialists to contribute domain expertise while enabling others to enhance how that information is structured and presented.\n\nAs seen in the SuperBenefit community's practices, members explicitly \"do a refizz\" on documents, reports, and knowledge assets to simplify concepts, improve clarity, and ensure information serves its intended purpose. This normalized practice creates psychological safety around sharing early-stage work with the understanding that collective refizzing will enhance rather than replace individual contributions.\n\n### Refizz in DAO Operations\n\n[Permalink: Refizz in DAO Operations](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tags/refizz.md#refizz-in-dao-operations)\n\nIn decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) contexts, refizzing plays a particularly important role in governance documentation and proposal development. As DAOs operate through distributed decision-making processes, clear documentation becomes essential for informed participation.\n\nRefizzing governance documents, proposals, and technical specifications helps ensure that diverse stakeholders with varying levels of context can meaningfully engage with important decisions. The practice supports more inclusive governance by transforming specialist knowledge into formats accessible to the broader community while maintaining accuracy and depth.\n\n## Related Concepts\n\n[Permalink: Related Concepts](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tags/refizz.md#related-concepts)\n\n- **Progress**: Refizzing contributes to progress tracking by improving how work and achievements are documented and communicated\n- **Practices**: Refizzing represents a specific knowledge management practice that enhances collaborative work\n- **Agreements**: Refizzing often clarifies and improves documentation of formal agreements between parties\n- **Patterns**: Similar to how patterns capture reusable solutions, refizzing creates more reusable knowledge assets\n\n## References and Resources\n\n[Permalink: References and Resources](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tags/refizz.md#references-and-resources)\n\n- Community usage demonstrates refizzing as an active practice within SuperBenefit's collaborative workflow\n- The term's origin appears in the referenced image (refizz-genesis.png), which provides historical context for this community practice\n\nYou can’t perform that action at this time.",

We use a \"digital gardening\" approach, where technical tools support the organic growth of our shared understanding.\n\nOur [public knowledge garden](https://knowledge.superbenefit.org/) shares curated artifacts and insights from this work, while this repository contains the complete workspace where that knowledge develops. This dual nature - private workspace and public garden - enables us to balance open sharing with the messy reality of knowledge development.\n\n### Key Features\n\n[Permalink: Key Features](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main#key-features)\n\n- **Local-First Markdown:** All content is stored as plain markdown files, giving you full control over your data.\n- **Obsidian Integration:** Designed for use with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a powerful knowledge management application.\n- **GitHub Version Control:** Leverages [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control, collaboration, and backup.\n- **Networked Knowledge:** Connects ideas through wiki-links and metadata, creating a rich and interconnected web of knowledge.\n- **Progressive Documentation:** Supports the evolution of knowledge from rough drafts to polished artifacts.\n\n* * *\n\n## Getting Started\n\n[Permalink: Getting Started](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main#getting-started)\n\n1. **Install Obsidian:** [Download Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) and familiarize yourself with its basic features.\n2. **Clone This Repository:**\n\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base.git\ncd knowledge-base\n```\n\n3. **Open as Obsidian Vault:** In Obsidian, select \"Open folder as vault\" and choose the cloned `knowledge-base` directory.\n4. **Configure Obsidian (Recommended):**\n   - Enable \"Automatically update internal links\" in Obsidian settings (inside Options/Files and links).\n5. **Start Exploring:** Browse the repository structure and start exploring the existing content.\n\n### Repository Structure\n\n[Permalink: Repository Structure](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main#repository-structure)\n\n- **[Artifacts](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/artifacts/readme.md)**: Published, refined content that represents our collective understanding. Contains finished research, documentation, and community-validated knowledge.\n- **[Notes](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/notes/readme.md)**: Working documents organized by project. This is where active development happens and where ideas mature through collaboration.\n- **[Drafts](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/drafts/readme.md)**: Private workspace for developing thoughts and initial research. This is where new ideas begin before they're ready for wider collaboration.\n- **[Links](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/links/readme.md)**: External references and resources, enriched with community commentary and analysis.\n- **[Tags](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tags/readme.md)**: Our shared vocabulary and conceptual framework, including term definitions and relationships.\n- **[Tools](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tools/readme.md)**: Knowledge management utilities, including:\n\n  - `templates/`: Standard document structures\n  - `types/`: Metadata schemas and definitions\n- **Attachments**: Media files, images, diagrams, and other supporting content used throughout the knowledge base.\n\n### Documentation\n\n[Permalink: Documentation](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main#documentation)\n\nEach directory contains two types of documentation to serve different audiences:\n\n- **README Files (e.g., `artifacts/readme.md`):** These files are primarily for contributors and knowledge managers working directly with the repository. They provide information on the directory's purpose, how to contribute, and any specific guidelines for that area. They are \"inner-facing\" documentation.\n- **Folder Notes (e.g., `artifacts/artifacts.md`):** These files are equivalent to index files and are published to the SuperBenefit Knowledge Garden to be displayed publicly. They provide an overview of the directory's content and guide readers on how to use and get the most value from the resources within. Folder notes always have the _same name as their parent directory_ (e.g., the folder note for `/artifacts` is `/artifacts/artifacts.md`). They are \"outward-facing\" documentation.\n\n* * *\n\n## Contributing\n\n[Permalink: Contributing](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main#contributing)\n\nWe welcome contributions to the SuperBenefit Knowledge Base! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines on how to contribute.\n\nHere are some ways you can contribute:\n\n- **Create new content:** Share your knowledge and insights by creating new notes and artifacts.\n- **Improve existing content:** Help us improve the quality and accuracy of our existing content by clarifying explanations, fixing errors, and adding new information.\n- **Connect ideas:** Create links between related notes and artifacts to build a rich and interconnected web of knowledge.\n- **Help others:** Welcome new contributors and help them find their way around the knowledge base.\n\n### Publishing & Syndication\n\n[Permalink: Publishing & Syndication](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main#publishing--syndication)\n\nSelect content from this knowledge base is published in the [SuperBenefit Knowledge Garden](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-garden).\n\nPages in the knowledge based with their `publish` property set to `true` may be imported to the knowledge garden and updated periodically. We're exploring [Plausibly Permanent Syndication](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fptaoYuqcwp85jsrVrIaSbbQlTzjfu5LVZMdWtWClNo/) as a way to share published content with the universal knowledge commons.\n\n### Building Your Own\n\n[Permalink: Building Your Own](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main#building-your-own)\n\nThis system is designed to be adaptable. You can fork this repository to create your own knowledge garden, customizing the structure and tools to match your needs. Our approach to knowledge management can be adapted to many different contexts while maintaining the core benefits of progressive documentation and networked learning.\n\n* * *\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n[Permalink: Additional Resources](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main#additional-resources)\n\n- Directory-specific guides in local readme files\n- Technical details in [tools](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tools/readme.md)\n- Templates for different content types in [tools/templates](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tools/templates/readme.md)\n- Metadata schemas in [tools/types](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tools/types/readme.md)\n\nFor support:\n\n1. Check existing documentation\n2. Ask in community channels\n3. Open GitHub issues\n\n* * *\n\nThis knowledge base grows through community contribution.

See the [SuperBenefit Knowledge Base README](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/artifacts/README.md) for a general overview of the project.\n\n## Contributing Artifacts\n\n[Permalink: Contributing Artifacts](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/artifacts#contributing-artifacts)\n\nReady to contribute a polished piece? Follow these steps:\n\n1. **Develop Ideas:** Start in `/drafts/` or `/notes/`, refining content with [community](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/artifacts/tags/community.md) input.\n2. **Polish & Validate:** Ensure content is well-structured, thoroughly reviewed, and linked to relevant sources.\n3. **Move to Artifacts:** Once complete and validated, move the content here.\n4. **Update Metadata:** Ensure all metadata fields are complete and accurate.\n\n### Maintaining Artifact Integrity\n\n[Permalink: Maintaining Artifact Integrity](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/artifacts#maintaining-artifact-integrity)\n\nThe documents in `/artifacts/` represent mature, carefully reviewed knowledge. As such, they require special consideration to maintain their integrity and usefulness. Once published, these files may be linked to and relied upon by others, both within SuperBenefit and in the wider community.\n\n- **Stable Locations:** To ensure the longevity of these resources, the location and filenames of artifacts should be considered permanent. Changing a filename or directory may break existing links and disrupt users.\n\n- **Semantic Filenames:** Filenames become URL slugs, so they should be clean and semantic using this name convention `file-name.md`. Use lowercase, dashes as word separators, and avoid special characters.\n\n- **Respect Authorial Intent:** Artifacts often represent a significant investment of thought and effort. Changes should be made with care and respect the original author's intention. Before making substantial edits, consult with the author and/or their team to ensure alignment.\n\n- **Content Review and Updates:** Regularly review artifacts for accuracy and relevance. If updates are needed, ensure they align with the original purpose and scope of the document.\n\n- **Contribution Guidelines:** All contributions to the knowledge base, including edits to artifacts, should follow the guidelines outlined in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/artifacts/CONTRIBUTING.md). This includes proper formatting, clear communication, and adherence to established conventions.\n\n- **Handling Deprecated Content:** If an artifact becomes outdated or irrelevant, consider archiving it instead of deleting it. Clearly mark the artifact as \"deprecated\" or \"archived\" and provide a link to the updated or replacement resource, if available.\n\n- **Image Optimization:** Optimize images within artifacts for web use. Use appropriate file formats (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`) and compress images to reduce file size without sacrificing quality. This improves page load times and enhances the user experience.\n\n- **Link Verification:** Regularly check for broken links within artifacts. Use a link checker tool to identify and fix any broken links to ensure that users can access all referenced resources.\n\n- **Metadata Consistency:** Ensure that metadata associated with artifacts (e.g., [index](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/artifacts/tags/index.md), categories, authors) is consistent and accurate. This helps users find and understand the content more easily.\n\n- **Additional Instructions:** When in doubt, seek guidance from experienced contributors or SuperBenefit admins.\n\n\n## Support\n\n[Permalink: Support](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/artifacts#support)\n\nFor general support and contribution guidelines, see the [SuperBenefit Knowledge Base README](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/artifacts/README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/artifacts/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nYou can’t perform that action at this time.",

(IYF)](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund#impact-yield-fund-iyf)\n\n## Project Definition\n\n[Permalink: Project Definition](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund#project-definition)\n\nThe Impact Yield Fund (IYF) is a novel financial structure that preserves capital while generating sustainable returns for investors and continuous support for community initiatives. The fund directs excess yield from secure DeFi protocols to support impactful social and environmental projects.\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n[Permalink: Directory Structure](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund#directory-structure)\n\nThis directory contains the following resources for understanding and implementing the Impact Yield Fund:\n\n- **[I.01-impact-yield-fund-concept.md](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund/I.01-impact-yield-fund-concept.md)** \\- Detailed explanation of the fund concept, structure, and key components\n- **[I.03-diagrams-and-visuals.md](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund/I.03-diagrams-and-visuals.md)** \\- Visual representations of the fund structure and flows\n- **[I.04-project-plan.md](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund/I.04-project-plan.md)** \\- Implementation roadmap and action items\n- **[I.05-discussion-paper-outline.md](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund/I.05-discussion-paper-outline.md)** \\- Structure for formal presentation to funders\n- **[I-Fund.md](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund/index.md)** \\- Comprehensive overview of the fund purpose and design\n\n## Discussion Paper Development\n\n[Permalink: Discussion Paper Development](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund#discussion-paper-development)\n\nThe next major milestone is developing a comprehensive discussion paper (7-8 pages) that articulates:\n\n- What an Impact Yield Fund is and how it works (6 pages)\n- The compelling case for this approach at this moment\n- Benefits for all stakeholders\n- Technical implementation details\n- Risk analysis and mitigation strategies\n- Pilot implementation plan\n- Potential application with Community Exchange (1 page max)\n- Clear next steps for interested partners (0.5 page)\n\n## Connection to Community Exchange\n\n[Permalink: Connection to Community Exchange](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund#connection-to-community-exchange)\n\nWhile the Impact Yield Fund and Community Exchange Commitment Pools (CCC) are distinct projects that can be pursued independently, they have significant synergistic potential. The excess yield from the fund can seed commitment pools, creating a powerful multiplier effect where each dollar of yield can support 5-10x its value in community exchange commitments.\n\n## Potential Applications\n\n[Permalink: Potential Applications](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund#potential-applications)\n\nThe Impact Yield Fund is designed to support various types of social impact initiatives. One possible application (to be discussed briefly at the end of the paper) is supporting Community Exchange Commitment Pools. Other potential applications include:\n\n1. **Environmental Restoration**: Funding habitat restoration and conservation\n2. **Social Enterprise**: Supporting impact-focused businesses\n3. **Education**: Funding scholarships and educational programs\n4. **Food Security**: Supporting sustainable agriculture initiatives\n5. **Digital Commons**: Maintaining open-source infrastructure\n\n## Key Partners\n\n[Permalink: Key Partners](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund#key-partners)\n\n- SuperBenefit (fund administration and technical design)\n- Boann Finance (potential seed investor)\n- ICS (local implementation partner)\n\n## Current Status\n\n[Permalink: Current Status](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund#current-status)\n\nThe fund concept has been developed and discussed internally at SuperBenefit and with potential partners. Initial conversations with Boann Finance indicate potential interest in this approach. The next steps are:\n\n1. Creating a formal discussion paper for potential funders\n2. Finalizing the technical architecture\n3. Developing a small-scale pilot in London, Ontario\n4. Establishing the governance framework\n5. Creating the legal structure\n\n## Resources Needed\n\n[Permalink: Resources Needed](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund#resources-needed)\n\nTo advance this project, SuperBenefit needs:\n\n- Technical development capacity\n- Legal expertise in financial structures and securities\n- Governance design input\n- Impact measurement framework\n- Marketing and communication support\n\n## Contact\n\n[Permalink: Contact](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/notes/ics/ccc/docs/I-Fund#contact)\n\nFor questions or contributions to this project, contact:\n\n- Project Lead: \\[Name\\]\n- Technical Lead: \\[Name\\]\n- Email: \\[Email\\]\n\n* * *\n\n_This documentation serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing the Impact Yield Fund. Each document can be read independently, but together they provide a complete picture of the fund's purpose, structure, and implementation path._\n\nYou can’t perform that action at this time.",

Guide\n\n[Permalink: SuperBenefit Lexicon: Contribution Guide](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tags#superbenefit-lexicon-contribution-guide)\n\nThe SuperBenefit Lexicon serves as the foundation of our shared understanding about decentralized organizations (DAOs), self-governance, and social impact. It creates a common language that helps us communicate complex ideas with precision and clarity. Beyond simple definitions, our lexicon builds connections between concepts, revealing relationships and patterns that might otherwise remain hidden.\n\nAs a navigational tool, the lexicon helps users discover related ideas through a web of interconnected terms. It serves as an educational resource for newcomers while also capturing our community's evolving understanding of key concepts. Think of it as our collective memory, documenting how our thinking develops over time.\n\nThis directory contains our shared vocabulary and conceptual framework. This guide will help you understand how our lexicon works and how you can contribute effectively to its growth and refinement.\n\n## Understanding the Lexicon's Purpose\n\n[Permalink: Understanding the Lexicon's Purpose](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tags#understanding-the-lexicons-purpose)\n\nBecause the language we use to describe decentralized systems is complex, we need a way to store, display and inter-relate this knowledge in a manner that's accessible to both human and machine readers as they navigate the jargon and complex concepts used in our work and conversations. This lexicon aims to aid communication and content creation in the following ways:\n\n- Individual tag pages serve as a place to organize related artifacts and concepts, helping readers find relevant content and navigate the knowledge garden\n- Term definitions are used to abstract tedious and distracting definitions away from artifacts and working documents, making them easier to read, understand and compose\n- When used with language models, the lexicon can augment generation of content to improve its accuracy and relevance\n\n### Origins of the Lexicon\n\n[Permalink: Origins of the Lexicon](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tags#origins-of-the-lexicon)\n\nThe lexicon was created to address contributor pain points and feedback from the community related to the difficulty of using web3 language within multi-disciplinary teams and audiences with varied backgrounds.\n\nA summary of the process used to create the lexicon:\n\n- Several dozen common topics were pulled from various published artifacts and working documents stored in the knowledge base.\n  - Lexicon entries were created manually by defining the topics in a manner relevant to the SuperBenefit community in a consistent format\n- A machine-assisted workflow was created using commercial LLM's to enhance and replicate the manually-established pattern, based on published works from SuperBenefit contributors for cultural context.\n  - More terms were added to expand the lexicon to a useful scope, then run through the AI workflow with humans in the loop for error correction (not much) and formatting fixes (quite a few)\n\nIn its current form, the lexicon can be used to enhance AI-assisted text generation enough to make general-purpose models like Claude of ChatGPT useful for working with knowledge at SuperBenefit.\n\n* * *\n\n## Creating Effective Lexicon Entries\n\n[Permalink: Creating Effective Lexicon Entries](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tags#creating-effective-lexicon-entries)\n\nWhen crafting a new lexicon entry, begin by thoroughly researching the concept. Understand not just what the term means, but how it relates to other concepts in our knowledge ecosystem. This understanding will help you create connections that enhance the value of your entry.\n\nYour definition should be clear enough for newcomers while remaining technically precise. Finding this balance can be challenging, but it's what makes our lexicon truly useful. Be thorough but efficient with language, avoiding unnecessary jargon while still maintaining accuracy.\n\nOne of the most valuable aspects of our lexicon is how it connects ideas. As you write, look for opportunities to link to related concepts using wiki-links (e.g., `[decentralization](tags/decentralization.md)`) or metadata tags (e.g., `tags: decentralization` ). Consider whether your term is a subtype or supertype of other concepts, and note these relationships explicitly where appropriate. If there are relevant artifacts that demonstrate the concept in practice, link to those as well. When terms might be confused with similar concepts, take time to highlight how they differ.\n\nThe tone of lexicon entries should be informative rather than promotional. Present concepts neutrally, helping readers form their own understanding. Where possible, include concrete examples that illustrate abstract concepts, making them more accessible and relatable\n\n### How Lexicon Entries Work\n\n[Permalink: How Lexicon Entries Work](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tags#how-lexicon-entries-work)\n\nEach term in our lexicon has its own markdown file with a consistent structure. We use the Tag Page Template found at [/tools/templates/Tag Page Template.md](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tools/templates/Tag%20Page%20Template.md) as the starting point for all new entries. This template ensures consistency across our lexicon and makes it easier for users to find the information they need.\n\nThe metadata schema for lexicon entries is defined in [/tools/types/tag.md](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tools/types/tag.md). This file specifies the required fields for each entry's frontmatter.\n\nThe title field contains the primary name of the concept. Your description should provide a brief (1-2 sentence) definition that will appear in previews and search results. The harvester field can include your name if you created or maintain the entry. Setting publish to true makes the entry visible in the public knowledge garden. The type is usually \"tag\" for lexicon entries. Under aliases, include alternative names for the concept, always including the term with a hashtag (e.g., \"#decentralization\"). The tags field categorizes your entry using existing categories.\n\nThe content of a lexicon entry typically begins with a concise definition in italics that captures the essence of the concept in 1-3 sentences. This is followed by an extended explanation that provides additional context and nuance. Most entries include sections that explain how the term is used in different contexts, particularly in relation to Web3, DAOs, and organizational design.\n\n### Style Guidelines\n\n[Permalink: Style Guidelines](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tags#style-guidelines)\n\nWrite in a way that welcomes both newcomers and experienced practitioners. Begin with clear, concise definitions before exploring complexity. Use straightforward language where possible, taking care to define technical terms when they're necessary. Your entry should flow logically, with a structure that guides readers through the concept naturally.\n\nMaintain a neutral tone throughout your entry, presenting the concept objectively rather than advocating for a particular viewpoint. Where relevant, acknowledge different interpretations and perspectives. Don't shy away from discussing tensions and trade-offs within the concept—these nuances often provide the most valuable insights.\n\nShow how the concept applies in specific domains like DAOs, Web3, and social impact work. Ground abstract ideas with concrete examples that illustrate how the concept functions in practice. Take time to explain how context might shift the concept's meaning or implementation across different settings.\n\nCreate explicit links to related concepts using wiki-links. Explain how terms relate to each other—whether one concept builds upon another, contrasts with it, or serves a complementary function. These connections help build a coherent knowledge network rather than isolated definitions.\n\nFormat the primary definition in italics at the beginning of your entry. Use level-two headings (##) for main sections and level-three headings (###) for subsections. Include a \"Related Concepts\" section that links to connected terms. Maintaining this consistent structure across entries helps readers navigate the lexicon efficiently.\n\n* * *\n\n## Getting Help\n\n[Permalink: Getting Help](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tags#getting-help)\n\nIf you have questions about contributing to the lexicon, check existing entries for examples of similar concepts, review the knowledge base documentation in [README.md](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base), ask in our community channels, or reach out to experienced contributors.\n\nOur lexicon grows through community contribution. Every addition enriches our collective understanding by adding not just content, but new connections and perspectives to our shared knowledge.\n\nYou can’t perform that action at this time.",

Think of them as design principles that can be applied across different contexts. For example, the \"Cell\" pattern describes how small autonomous teams can operate within larger networks.\n\n**Case Studies** provide real-world evidence of patterns in action. They document actual experiments and implementations, showing how abstract patterns play out in practice. These are created through the Experiment Documentation Framework's synthesis phase, following a structured narrative from initial discovery through implementation to outcomes and lessons learned.\n\n**Guides** offer detailed, step-by-step implementation instructions for specific governance approaches. Unlike patterns (which are conceptual) or playbooks (which combine multiple patterns), guides provide practical \"how-to\" instructions for implementing particular governance structures. The attached implementation guides for community, operational, and multi-stakeholder governance exemplify this format.\n\n**Playbooks** combine multiple patterns and reference relevant guides to create comprehensive implementation strategies. They take the conceptual frameworks of patterns, the practical evidence of case studies, and the detailed instructions of guides to create complete implementation pathways for specific use cases.\n\n## The Foundation: Playbook Context Document\n\n[Permalink: The Foundation: Playbook Context Document](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tools/workflows/artifacts/playbooks#the-foundation-playbook-context-document)\n\nSince the content creation framework is subject-agnostic, each playbook requires a detailed context document that captures the specific strategic, audience, and implementation context. This context document serves as the foundation for all subsequent content decisions.\n\n### Creating or Reviewing the Context Document\n\n[Permalink: Creating or Reviewing the Context Document](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tools/workflows/artifacts/playbooks#creating-or-reviewing-the-context-document)\n\nBefore any content creation begins, ensure you have a comprehensive Playbook Context document. This can be created through a 45-minute collaborative session using the playbook context worksheet.\n\n**Example Human Prompt to Create Context:**\n\n> \"I need to create a Playbook Context document for our DAO Cell and Community Governance Playbook. Can you provide the context gathering worksheet and guide me through capturing:\n>\n> 1. Strategic foundation (problem, theory, success vision)\n> 2. Audience profile and constraints\n> 3. Content strategy and tone\n> 4. Implementation pathways\n>    Based on our RPP experiments and stakeholder feedback.\"\n\n**Example Human Prompt if Context Exists:**\n\n> \"Here's our existing Playbook Context document for the DAO Cell and Community Governance Playbook \\[attach document\\]. Please review it and help me:\n>\n> 1. Identify any gaps or areas needing clarification\n> 2. Ensure it aligns with insights from our recent experiments\n> 3. Confirm the audience profile still matches our stakeholder needs\"\n\nThe AI uses the context document as the lens through which all content decisions are made - from language choices to pattern organization to example selection.\n\n## Leveraging the Experiment Documentation Framework\n\n[Permalink: Leveraging the Experiment Documentation Framework](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tools/workflows/artifacts/playbooks#leveraging-the-experiment-documentation-framework)\n\nThe RPP project uses a sophisticated Experiment Documentation Framework that progressively builds content through four phases. Understanding this framework is crucial because it generates much of the content needed for the playbook automatically.\n\n### How the Framework Works\n\n[Permalink: How the Framework Works](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tools/workflows/artifacts/playbooks#how-the-framework-works)\n\nThe framework transforms real-world experiments into documented knowledge through:\n\n- **Discovery Phase**: Understanding context and challenges\n- **Intervention Phase**: Designing experiments and implementation approaches\n- **Reflection Phase**: Capturing learning from what actually happened\n- **Synthesis Phase**: Creating comprehensive case studies\n\nEach phase builds on the previous ones without duplication, creating a natural flow of information that culminates in polished case studies ready for the playbook.\n\n### What This Means for Content Creation\n\n[Permalink: What This Means for Content Creation](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tools/workflows/artifacts/playbooks#what-this-means-for-content-creation)\n\nInstead of creating content from scratch, much of your playbook content already exists within experiment documentation:\n\n- **Case studies** are produced by the synthesis phase\n- **Pattern identification** happens throughout the documentation process\n- **Implementation details** for guides are captured in intervention and reflection phases\n- **Stakeholder perspectives** are woven throughout all phases\n\n## The Integrated Collaborative Workflow\n\n[Permalink: The Integrated Collaborative Workflow](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tools/workflows/artifacts/playbooks#the-integrated-collaborative-workflow)\n\n### Step 1: Context-Informed Content Inventory\n\n[Permalink: Step 1: Context-Informed Content Inventory](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tools/workflows/artifacts/playbooks#step-1-context-informed-content-inventory)\n\nUsing the Playbook Context document as a guide, the human reviews existing experiment documentation to understand what content aligns with the playbook's strategic foundation and audience needs.\n\n**Example Human Prompt:**\n\n> \"Based on our Playbook Context document showing we're targeting nonprofit leaders with limited web3 experience, I need to inventory our experiment documentation. Please help me:\n>\n> 1. Identify case studies that demonstrate success with similar audiences\n> 2. Find experiments that address the key problems our audience faces (bureaucracy, tech overwhelm, etc.)\n> 3. Extract patterns that align with our 'minimum viable permissionless' approach\n> 4. Note which experiments show clear before/after transformation relevant to social impact orgs\"\n\nThe AI filters the content inventory through the context lens, prioritizing materials that match the audience profile and address their specific pain points.\n\n### Step 2: Pattern Development Aligned with Context\n\n[Permalink: Step 2: Pattern Development Aligned with Context](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tools/workflows/artifacts/playbooks#step-2-pattern-development-aligned-with-context)\n\nThe human and AI develop patterns that resonate with the specific audience and theory of change outlined in the context document.\n\n**Example Human Prompt:**\n\n> \"Our context document emphasizes 'composability, transparency, and solidarity' as core principles. Based on our case studies showing participatory budgeting and multi-stakeholder coordination, please:\n>\n> 1. Draft patterns using Grade 9 reading level language\n> 2. Avoid crypto jargon while explaining web3 concepts\n> 3. Include examples from social impact contexts rather than DeFi\n> 4. Show how these patterns help shift power dynamics in traditional organizations\"\n\nThe AI crafts patterns that speak directly to the audience's context, using appropriate language and examples that connect to their experience.\n\n### Step 3: Guide Extraction Addressing Specific Constraints\n\n[Permalink: Step 3: Guide Extraction Addressing Specific Constraints](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tools/workflows/artifacts/playbooks#step-3-guide-extraction-addressing-specific-constraints)\n\nThe human identifies guides needed based on where the target audience typically gets stuck, as documented in the context.\n\n**Example Human Prompt:**\n\n> \"Our context shows people get stuck with:\n>\n> - Wallet safety and on-ramping\n> - Getting organizational buy-in\n> - Avoiding recreation of old hierarchies\n>\n> Can you extract implementation insights from our experiments to create guides that:\n>\n> 1. Address these specific friction points\n> 2. Acknowledge time and bureaucracy constraints\n> 3. Provide 'minimum viable' starting points\n> 4. Include risk mitigation for common fears\"\n\nThe AI develops guides that directly address the constraints and stuck points identified in the context document.\n\n### Step 4: Context-Driven Playbook Assembly\n\n[Permalink: Step 4: Context-Driven Playbook Assembly](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tools/workflows/artifacts/playbooks#step-4-context-driven-playbook-assembly)\n\nWith the context document guiding decisions, the human outlines how to organize content for maximum impact with the target audience.\n\n**Example Human Prompt:**\n\n> \"Given our audience includes busy nonprofit executives who need to see impact quickly, please create a playbook structure that:\n>\n> 1. Opens with compelling transformation stories from similar organizations\n> 2. Provides a clear 0 → 0.5 → 1 progression pathway\n> 3. Groups patterns by implementation phase rather than technical complexity\n> 4. Highlights quick wins before diving into deeper governance changes\n> 5. Includes decision trees for different organizational contexts (foundation vs grassroots vs co-op)\"\n\nThe AI assembles the playbook following the strategic approach and success vision from the context document.\n\n### Step 5: Supplementary Materials for Audience Success\n\n[Permalink: Step 5: Supplementary Materials for Audience Success](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tools/workflows/artifacts/playbooks#step-5-supplementary-materials-for-audience-success)\n\nBased on the success metrics and implementation context, the human identifies what additional support the audience needs.\n\n**Example Human Prompt:**\n\n> \"Our context document defines success as users being able to understand AND implement these approaches. Our audience faces time constraints and complexity overwhelm. Please create:\n>\n> 1. One-page visual summaries of key patterns\n> 2. Comparison charts showing web3 vs traditional approaches\n> 3. ROI calculators for common use cases\n> 4. 'Red flag' checklists to avoid scams\n> 5. Template pitch decks for getting board buy-in\"\n\nThe AI creates materials specifically designed to help the audience overcome their unique constraints and achieve the success metrics defined in the context.\n\n### Step 6: Context Validation and Refinement\n\n[Permalink: Step 6: Context Validation and Refinement](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tools/workflows/artifacts/playbooks#step-6-context-validation-and-refinement)\n\nThroughout the process, the human and AI continuously validate content against the context document to ensure alignment.\n\n**Example Human Prompt:**\n\n> \"Please review our assembled playbook content against our context document to ensure:\n>\n> 1. Language matches Grade 9 reading level throughout\n> 2. Examples resonate with social impact practitioners\n> 3. The progression matches how our audience actually seeks and uses guidance\n> 4. Success stories demonstrate the specific transformations we envision\n> 5. Tone bridges both 'social impact essence and tech essence' as specified\"\n\n## The Power of Context-Driven Creation\n\n[Permalink: The Power of Context-Driven Creation](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tools/workflows/artifacts/playbooks#the-power-of-context-driven-creation)\n\nThe Playbook Context document transforms a generic framework into a powerful tool for specific transformation. It ensures every content decision - from word choice to example selection to structural organization - serves the actual humans who will use the playbook.\n\nThis context-first approach means:\n\n- **Patterns** are explained in language that resonates with your specific audience\n- **Case studies** highlight transformations relevant to their situation\n- **Guides** address their actual constraints and stuck points\n- **Playbooks** follow a journey that matches how they naturally progress\n\n## Maintaining Context Alignment\n\n[Permalink: Maintaining Context Alignment](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tools/workflows/artifacts/playbooks#maintaining-context-alignment)\n\nAs experiments complete and new insights emerge, regularly revisit the context document:\n\n**Quarterly Context Review Prompt:**\n\n> \"Based on feedback from playbook users and newly completed experiments, please help me:\n>\n> 1. Update our audience profile with new insights about their needs\n> 2. Refine our understanding of where they get stuck\n> 3. Adjust our success metrics based on actual outcomes\n> 4. Identify new implementation contexts that have emerged\"\n\nThis ensures the playbook remains a living document that evolves with your community's understanding and needs.\n\n## Integration Best Practices\n\n[Permalink: Integration Best Practices](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/tree/main/tools/workflows/artifacts/playbooks#integration-best-practices)\n\n**Start with context**: Never begin content creation without a clear context document. If one doesn't exist, creating it is the essential first step.\n\n**Filter everything through context**: Every content decision should reference back to the strategic foundation, audience profile, and implementation context.\n\n**Use context as a quality check**: When reviewing content, the context document provides the criteria for evaluation.\n\n**Update context as you learn**: The context document should evolve as experiments reveal new insights about your audience and their journey.\n\nThe result is a playbook perfectly tuned to its intended audience - using their language, addressing their specific challenges, and guiding them along a journey that makes sense for their context. This transforms a collection of patterns and case studies into a powerful tool for real transformation.\n\nYou can’t perform that action at this time.",

Garden](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-garden#superbenefits-knowledge-garden)\n\n> \"\\[One\\] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but \\[they\\] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.\" — Richard Hamming\n\nKnowledge from the SuperBenefit community and its projects is stored here. You can use this space to learn, record and share what matters to you in your journey with SuperBenefit.\n\n## Using This Repo\n\n[Permalink: Using This Repo](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-garden#using-this-repo)\n\nThis repo is maintained using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and published using [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz). Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.\nQuartz v4 features a from-the-ground rewrite focusing on end-user extensibility and ease-of-use.\n\n🔗 Check out the [docs](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-garden/blob/v4/docs) directory or the official [Quartz documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) to learn more.\n\n## Customizations\n\n[Permalink: Customizations](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-garden#customizations)\n\nThis repository extends the default Quartz v4 template with several custom features and modifications tailored for the SuperBenefit Knowledge Garden.\n\n### 🎨 Type-Aware Layout System\n\n[Permalink: 🎨 Type-Aware Layout System](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-garden#-type-aware-layout-system)\n\n**Files:**`quartz/types/`, `quartz/plugins/emitters/artifactPage.tsx`, `quartz/plugins/emitters/referencePage.tsx`\n\n**Commits:** [5212cb11](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-garden/commit/5212cb11), [30cab1af](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-garden/commit/30cab1af), [3dab4957](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-garden/commit/3dab4957)\n\nA sophisticated content management system that automatically applies different page layouts based on content type detection:\n\n- **Dynamic Type Loading**: Loads type definitions from `content/tools/types/*.md` (Obsidian Metadata Menu format)\n- **Type Hierarchy**: Supports inheritance (`note` → `artifact`/`reference` → specific types)\n- **Category-Based Routing**: Routes content to specialized emitters based on type category\n- **Graceful Fallback**: Unknown types fall back to default Quartz layouts\n- **TypeBadge Component**: Visual indicators for content types (⚡ Pattern, 📖 Playbook, etc.)\n\n### 📚 Citation Management\n\n[Permalink: 📚 Citation Management](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-garden#-citation-management)\n\n**Files:**`quartz/components/CitationGenerator.tsx`, `quartz/components/CitationStyles.ts`, `quartz/components/CitationExports.ts`\n\n**Purpose:** Academic citation generation and management\n\nComprehensive citation system supporting multiple academic formats:\n\n- **Multiple Styles**: APA, MLA, Chicago, IEEE, and Harvard citation formats\n- **Export Options**: Copy to clipboard, download as BibTeX, or export as formatted text\n- **Frontmatter Integration**: Automatically generates citations from page metadata\n- **Smart Formatting**: Handles author lists, dates, URLs, and DOIs intelligently\n\n### 📜 License Information Display\n\n[Permalink: 📜 License Information Display](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-garden#-license-information-display)\n\n**Files:**`quartz/components/LicenseInfo.tsx`\n\n**Purpose:** Creative Commons license visualization\n\nVisual license display component:\n\n- **CC License Icons**: Displays appropriate Creative Commons license badges\n- **License Links**: Direct links to license deeds\n- **Frontmatter-Driven**: Reads license info from page metadata\n- **Visual Clarity**: Clean, recognizable CC iconography\n\n### 🎯 Custom Header Navigation\n\n[Permalink: 🎯 Custom Header Navigation](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-garden#-custom-header-navigation)\n\n**Files:**`quartz/components/Header.tsx`\n\n**Purpose:** Customized site navigation\n\nEnhanced header with SuperBenefit-specific navigation:\n\n- **Custom Links**: Direct links to Artifacts, Projects, Lexicon, and Library sections\n- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly navigation\n- **Configurable**: Easy to modify links and structure\n\n### 🖼️ Banner Images\n\n[Permalink: 🖼️ Banner Images](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-garden#%EF%B8%8F-banner-images)\n\n**Files:**`quartz/components/BannerImage.tsx`\n\n**Purpose:** Obsidian-compatible banner/hero images\n\nSeamless integration with Obsidian's banner system:\n\n- **Obsidian Wiki-link Support**: Parses `banner: \"![[attachments/image.webp]]\"` format\n- **Multiple Formats**: Supports wiki-links, direct paths, and external URLs\n- **Graceful Fallback**: Conditionally renders only when images are specified\n- **Legacy Support**: Falls back to `image` property for backward compatibility\n- **Responsive Design**: Optimized display for desktop and mobile devices\n\n### 🎨 Visual Customization\n\n[Permalink: 🎨 Visual Customization](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-garden#-visual-customization)\n\n**Files:**`quartz.config.ts`\n\n**Configuration Changes:**\n\n- **Custom Fonts**:\n\n  -

This repository provides a framework for creating comprehensive governance documentation that supports transparency and effective collaboration.\n\n## Our Governance Approach\n\n[Permalink: Our Governance Approach](https://github.com/superbenefit/state-template#our-governance-approach)\n\nThis template recognizes that DAOs function as purpose-aligned communities rather than traditional institutional structures. Effective governance emerges from clear agreements, transparent processes, and accessible documentation that enables diverse contributors to coordinate while preserving their unique perspectives and contributions.\n\nThe governance model creates frameworks that allow different types of participants to contribute meaningfully without forcing uniform approaches. Purpose alignment serves as the unifying mechanism that enables diverse contributors—from core teams to community participants to external collaborators—to coordinate effectively while maintaining their distinct characteristics and methods.\n\nThis approach distributes decision-making authority appropriately rather than centralizing control. The git-based structure reflects this inclusive design, ensuring that all voices can contribute to governance evolution through transparent, collaborative processes.\n\n## Repository Structure\n\n[Permalink: Repository Structure](https://github.com/superbenefit/state-template#repository-structure)\n\nThe governance documentation is organized into three interconnected sections:\n\n**Agreements** establish the foundation for how different participants work together productively. These documents create clarity about how contributors relate to the shared purpose and to each other while respecting appropriate autonomy for different types of engagement.\n\n**Policies** translate agreements into practical systems that enable coordination across different scales and domains. These frameworks evolve more frequently than agreements, allowing the governance system to adapt to changing needs while preserving foundational coordination mechanisms.\n\n**Proposals** maintain institutional memory of governance decisions and their outcomes. This section preserves records that demonstrate how collective decisions have shaped the organization, creating accountability and enabling new participants to understand the organization's development.\n\nTogether, these sections create a governance ecosystem that supports meaningful participation while ensuring coordination occurs in ways that advance shared purpose.\n\n## Using This Template\n\n[Permalink: Using This Template](https://github.com/superbenefit/state-template#using-this-template)\n\nOrganizations implementing this template should adapt it to reflect their specific purpose, participant composition, and coordination needs. Focus on authentic representation of how different groups actually coordinate rather than imposing external frameworks.\n\nThe template supports various coordination patterns while providing a foundation for purpose-aligned collaboration. Adapt the language and structures to reflect your community's specific context and relationships.\n\nWhen implementing, consider these coordination scales:\n\n**Team coordination** occurs when small groups work together directly on specific initiatives. Governance focuses on maintaining alignment while preserving the unique contributions that diversity brings.\n\n**System coordination** manages relationships between different groups and functions within the organization. This involves creating transparent interfaces that enable effective collaboration while respecting appropriate autonomy.\n\n**Organization coordination** addresses direction-setting and resource allocation that affects the entire community. This scale creates mechanisms for diverse groups to participate meaningfully in collective decisions.\n\n## Contributing to Governance\n\n[Permalink: Contributing to Governance](https://github.com/superbenefit/state-template#contributing-to-governance)\n\nGovernance evolves through the active participation of all community members. This template encourages participants to engage with governance documentation as contributors to its ongoing development.\n\nChanges follow established decision-making procedures that preserve the integrity of collective agreements while enabling adaptive evolution based on changing circumstances and emerging needs.\n\n* * *\n\n_This template provides a foundation for governance documentation. Organizations should adapt its language, structures, and examples to reflect their specific purpose and coordination methods._\n\n## About\n\nA customized template for DAO state documentation\n\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/superbenefit/state-template#readme-ov-file)\n\n### License\n\n[CC0-1.0 license](https://github.com/superbenefit/state-template#CC0-1.0-1-ov-file)\n\n### Contributing\n\n[Contributing](https://github.com/superbenefit/state-template#contributing-ov-file)\n\n### Uh oh!\n\nThere was an error while loading.

Coordinated by [Windfall Ecology Centre](https://windfallcentre.ca/), the pilot will serve [Durham Region](https://www.durham.ca/en/index.aspx) in Southern Ontario, Canada, providing owner/occupant controlled building data ledgers to 200,000 homes as part of [Canada's Greener Homes Initiative](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/energy-efficiency/homes/canada-greener-homes-initiative/24831).\n\nOrganizations and community representatives participating in the Pilot Stakeholder group include:\n\n- [Durham Region](https://www.durham.ca/en/index.aspx)\n- [Indigenous Aware](https://www.indigenousaware.com/)\n- [Alectra Utilities](https://alectrautilities.com/)\n- [Clean Air Partnership](https://www.cleanairpartnership.org/)\n- [Volta Research](https://voltaresearch.org/)\n- [Toronto and Region Conservation Authority](https://trca.ca/)\n- [Oshawa Power](https://www.oshawapower.ca/)\n- [Six Nations of the Grand River](https://www.sixnations.ca/)\n\n### Stakeholder Discussions\n\n[Permalink: Stakeholder Discussions](https://github.com/superbenefit/WREEP-docs#stakeholder-discussions)\n\nTo inform the development of the litepaper, the [Protocol Research Group](https://github.com/superbenefit/WREEP-docs/blob/main/#protocol-research-group) held a series of discussions with key stakeholders in the proposed Durham Region pilot. These discussions included an overview of the protocol design at key points in its development and provided an open space for questions and discussion among the Research and Stakeholder groups.\n\nRecordings and other information related to these discussions can be found below. Direct feedback and questions from stakeholders, as well as their identities, have been redacted to ensure an open environment for discussion.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| :-: | :-: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Session #1** | Protocol Overview |  | [**Video Recording**](https://vimeo.com/911712812) | [**Proof of Attendance**](https://poap.gallery/event/167375) | [wpshd-1-thumbnail.png](https://github.com/superbenefit/WREEP-docs/blob/main/.gitbook/assets/wpshd-1-thumbnail.png) | [https://lu.ma/g4m2o2wb](https://lu.ma/g4m2o2wb) |\n| **Session #2** | Technical Deep-Dive |  | [**Video Recording**](https://vimeo.com/914631253) | [**Proof of Attendance**](https://poap.gallery/event/168306) | [wpshd-2-thumbnail.png](https://github.com/superbenefit/WREEP-docs/blob/main/.gitbook/assets/wpshd-2-thumbnail.png) | [https://lu.ma/bipzjjr5](https://lu.ma/bipzjjr5) |\n| **Session #3** | Litepaper Presentation |  | [~~Video Recording~~](https://github.com/superbenefit/WREEP-docs#user-content-user-content-fn-1-f3f2efa34ae6cc7c6e7a444ecb32759e) | [**Proof of Attendance**](https://poap.gallery/event/168937) | [wpshd-3-thumbnail.png](https://github.com/superbenefit/WREEP-docs/blob/main/.gitbook/assets/wpshd-3-thumbnail.png) | [https://lu.ma/8m55tp6w](https://lu.ma/8m55tp6w) |\n\n* * *\n\n## [Windfall Protocol Community](https://github.com/superbenefit/WREEP-docs/blob/main/community)\n\n[Permalink: Windfall Protocol Community](https://github.com/superbenefit/WREEP-docs#windfall-protocol-community)\n\nThe goal of the community is to contribute ideas and feedback to the development of the protocol itself, as well as promoting innovation on top of the protocol.\n\nCommunity Membership is open to all individuals who wish to participate.

Vitalik has talked about the idea of [commitment pools](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/06/12/nonfin.html) before, the problem is simple: you want to sign or endorse some idea, but you're only comfortable doing it publicly if enough other people also do so. Maybe it's some cancelable take, like \"based is an annoying word shouldn't be used\" (it's not, it's a great word, but you can imagine for things that are unpopular or more controversial people would only be comfortable sharing their endorsement if enough other people also do so), or something you don't feel comfortable initially sharing the idea of etc.\n\n**How do we do this in a trust-minimized way**?\n\nzkPIN is a basic implemention of this with snarks: users create commitment pools (call them the operator), anyone can then sign it and generate a zkSNARK proof (that attests to certain properties we'll elaborate on below), **but their affiliation remains anonymous to the server, operator, and public until the threshold is reached** (hence the name zkPIN or power in numbers). Note that by design, zkPIN only requires an **honest minority trust assumption between the operator and the server**. We'll elaborate on this construction more below, but both the server and the operator have to collude in order to dox signatures of people before a threshold for a commitment pool has been reached. Assuming one party is honest, this is effectively not possible (more details in the better guarantees section) i.e. the server has no knowledge of who signed it and neither does the operator until the threshold is reached.\n\n### Basic flow and demo\n\n[Permalink: Basic flow and demo](https://github.com/zk-pin/pin#basic-flow-and-demo)\n\nHome page shows a list of commitment pools.\n\n- To interact with one or create your own, you need to log in.\n- When you log in, a new private, public keypair is generated for you, and your private key is stored in local storage. No private key ever touches our server, only the public keys are stored on our end.\n- Once you log in, you can create a commitment pool (this will generate a new operator private, public keypair which is stored in local storage) and set the threshold of signers required to reveal all endorsements.\n- Anyone who wants to sign a commitment pool can navigate to the pool on the home page, click it, then sign it. When you sign it, a new zkSNARK proof is generated that enforces some conditions which we describe below to ensure your attestation is valid.\n- Once enough signatures have accumalated (past the the size of the threshold), the operator will when they navigate back to the commitment pool see a \"Reveal\" button which they can now click to reveal all affiliations (note as a result, this does assume the operator is live for the full process to work, although there is no time limit for when the reveal needs to happen currently).\n\nFull video of the demo is here:\n\nzkpin-compressed.mp4\n\n### Important notices about the construction\n\n[Permalink: Important notices about the construction](https://github.com/zk-pin/pin#important-notices-about-the-construction)\n\nIn order to distribute the trust assumption before the threshold of signatures is reached, we designed the app in a trust-minimzed way, taking advantage of zkSNARKs to do so. The rough idea is that when we generate a signature, we create a SNARK proof that attests this signature was valid, keeping all revealing inputs private, **but allowing the operator + server to work together to derive the original signer after the threshold is reached**. When a user signs a commitment pool, we generate a zkSNARK proof and a ciphertext that is the symmetric encryption of the message (the commitment pool id) and a shared secret (between the operator and the signer). We'll explain some of this in more detail in the zkSNARK construction, but for now, we just need to know that the act of \"signing\" a commitment pool creates a zkSNARK proof (which we store on IPFS) and a ciphertext, which we store on our server.\n\nThe reason this app is **trust-minimized** by design, is that **neither the server nor the operator can alone figure out at any point in time before the threshold is reached who has signed a commitment pool without both colluding**. The reason is because the ciphertexts are stored on the server, but the server has no knowledge of the operator's private key. Similarly, the operator can decrypt the ciphertexts and find out who has signed it, but the operator has no knowledge of what the ciphertexts are nor the range of possible people who could have signed it. So the short summary is that we have two parts of data that both need to be used together to figure out who has signed a commitment pool, but each part is kept separate from the other until the threshold is reached. **Thus zkPIN has an honest minority trust assumption between the operator and the server**. Assuming one is honest, it's impossible to dox who has signed a commitment pool, both must collude in order to do so.\n\nNote as a small point of nuance, the app will know once the threshold is reached by counting the number of ciphertexts i.e. for a new incoming signature before threshold is reached, the server checks if the list of ciphertexts is now equal to the\n\n### zkSNARK Circuit Construction\n\n[Permalink: zkSNARK Circuit Construction](https://github.com/zk-pin/pin#zksnark-circuit-construction)\n\nThe exact construction of this circuit is shown below.\n\n```\nI generate a snark proof that:\n\nprivate input my_priv, my_pub, c\npublic inputs pool_pub, merkle_root, msg, chash\n\nshared_secret = ecdh(my_priv, pool_pub)\nc = sym_enc(msg, shared_secret)\nmy_pub in merkle_root\nmy_pub = pubkeygen(my_priv)\nchash = hash(c)\n```\n\nThe high level idea is as follows:\n\n- for every commitment pool, the creator of the pool is designated as the \"operator\" and a new private, public keypair is generated for that pool\n- for a signer coming in to sign this commitment pool, we generate a shared secret between their key and the operator's key with [Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)\n- to provide some weak sybil resistance, we verify that the signer's public key is in a merkle root of all known \"sybil-resistant\" public keys. These are public keys which have\nverified their account by logging into Twitter (when you log in with Twitter for the first time, we add your generated public key to a merkle root of these \"sybil-resistant\" addresses we've lossely verified)\n- we verify the relationship between your private key and your public key (that the public key is in fact correctly derived from the private key)\n- finally, we verify the ciphertext hash provided is mapped correctly to the ciphertext\n  - note the resaon we do this as opposed to just providing the ciphertext as a public input is because proofs are stored on IPFS, so if an operator was able to access these proofs before the threshold was reached (if we wanted to have some more complex escrow scheme with better properties below), they'd be able to learn the ciphertexts themselves and \"dox\" the signers from the public signals. So instead the hash of the cihertext is a public input and the ciphertext is a private input\n\n### Better guarantees\n\n[Permalink: Better guarantees](https://github.com/zk-pin/pin#better-guarantees)\n\nzkPIN has as we've discussed before, an honest minority trust assumption between the server and the operator, but implements no censorship-resistance. There are two ways we can get better guarantees\n\n- some escrow style system which requires staking and slashes the server/operator if they don't reveal their part of the data when the threshold is reached.\n  - currently, a malicious operator may choose to never reveal their private key when the threshold is reached or vice versa with the server and the ciphertexts, preventing us from \"revealing\" the commitment pool. Implementing a basic contract which requires operators and the server to stake some money and then slashes them if they don't provide the data (within some time frame) would provide a better economic incentive for censorship-resistance. Some brief explorations for this can be found under `commit_reveal` but these are currently incomplete (although very possible and feasible to implement).\n- to remove the need for an operator entirely, the gold standard would be having [threshold encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_cryptosystem) inside of a SNARK, that way we minimize trust at the lowest cryptography level, without the need for an operator.\n\n### Disclaimer\n\n[Permalink: Disclaimer](https://github.com/zk-pin/pin#disclaimer)\n\nNote this app is provided as a proof of concept, it has not been formally audited and as such there can be no assurance they will work as intended, and users may experience delays, failures, errors, omissions or loss of transmitted information.

I have video content from the past that need to see the light of the future. From collection of High 8s, mini DVS, VHS, to modern day digital cameras, we can find support for equipment that can turn these oldies into new money. We can collaborate for film projects that can be monetized for the community to share.\n\nPainting, Art, Music, Sports are ways to attract the youth away from harmful temptations of drugs , gangs, or illegal activities found in society when we are lost to roam with no guidance. By adding this platform to be an option for families, it has proven to spark positive changes. Basketball courts had been used for exercise, meetings, evacuation centers, town hall meetings, concerts, and sporting events, outside of basketball. By focusing on developing and monitoring each court, we can use it's growth as an example for all to get inspired. By creating this center of communication, a hub for all the courts we built up, we were able to connect each other, and were able to do exchanges that helped bridge movements together. Our design is focused on creating revenue streams, that will continue to contribute without asking government or corporate funding. To be as self sufficient as possible, powered by the same people being rewarded. To discover talent in entertainment and sports, To be able to contribute goodness to the world by planting trees, clothing the homeless, feeding the hungry, we will push through it starting with these Basketball Courts and their dreams.

They can be pretty much any­thing, such as memes or game objects, although much of the cur­rent hype about NFTs relates to blue-chip col­lec­tions, like an ape from the Bored Ape Yacht Club col­lec­tion that NBA player Stephen Curry pur­chased in August for a whop­ping 55 ETH (roughly US$180,000 at the time), and wears as his cos­metic Twit­ter avatar.\n\nObserv­ers may won­der if NFTs are a passing trend: Why should a meme, which drives cul­ture, betreated like an asset, which drives eco­nom­ies? Maybe all the noth­ing we do on the inter­net is worth a little something after all. Inter­net-nat­ive tech­no­lo­gies, cur­ren­cies, iden­tit­ies and social organ­iz­a­tions are spread­ing the idea that the digital lives we lead can be as valu­able to us as the lives we lead IRL (in real life).\n\nTo some, NFTs show­case a future for the inter­net where we can all own and token­ize pieces of it using tech­no­logy such as the block­chain (a pub­lic ledger). As deeply social sites of block­chain cul­ture, NFT com­munit­ies help to con­vert digital nat­ives into crypto nat­ives who might want to live in a uni­verse of wal­lets.\n\nWhen cre­at­ors, col­lect­ors and com­munity mem­bers build and pop­ular­ize NFT projects, they are also doing the proofs of concept for how block­chain pro­to­cols could work in tomor­row’s inter­net. The key aes­thet­ics of block chains are immut­ab­il­ity (unchange­ab­il­ity), trans­par­ency and decent­ral­iz­a­tion. As a tech­no­logy eth­no­grapher, I’ve been immersed in NFT com­munit­ies since the sum­mer, when Dave Jaf­fer, an early adop­ter of many inter­net cul­tures, intro­duced me to buy­ing pieces from dif­fer­ent col­lec­tions (some of which are men­tioned in this essay). NFT cre­at­ors are strategiz­ing and exper­i­ment­ing with how well those con­cepts work, as com­pet­ing future vis­ions of the inter­net gradu­ally come into focus.\n\nWhen cre­at­ors, col­lect­ors and com­munity mem­bers build and pop­ular­ize NFT projects, they are also doing the proofs of concept for how block­chain pro­to­cols could work in tomor­row’s inter­net.

NFT cre­at­ors are strategiz­ing and exper­i­ment­ing with how well those con­cepts work, as com­pet­ing future vis­ions of the inter­net gradu­ally come into focus.\n\nBlock­chains, such as the Eth­ereum block­chain most NFT com­munit­ies use, are giant data stores of trans­ac­tion records that nobody owns, and any­one can access. Any­one can look up a wal­let by its address on the block­chain, and see what crypto cur­ren­cies or digital assets it con­tains. Sim­il­arly, any­one can pay to have their trans­ac­tions logged as an immut­able record on a block­chain. Your iden­tity on the block­chain is your wal­let, but you might asso­ciate your wal­let with your social iden­tity. NFTs bridge that gap between the tech­nical defin­i­tion of what you own, and the cul­tural bene­fit of own­ing it. For example, the most pop­u­lar use case for NFTs are avatar projects, which people buy and wear as their pro­file pic­tures on social-media plat­forms, such as to sig­nal status or group mem­ber­ship. As Lana Swartz, Quinn DuPont and other schol­ars argue, new money tech­no­lo­gies cre­ate new forms of iden­tity and power, and they map onto devel­op­ments in social com­mu­nic­a­tion and co-ordin­a­tion.\n\nIf the block­chain rep­res­ents the mas­ter ledger under­ly­ing this new vis­ion of the inter­net, users com­ing together in these online com­munit­ies rep­res­ent indi­vidual cus­tom­ers con­greg­at­ing in mar­ket­places. In the NFT world, there are rituals for bond­ing, online and in-per­son events, and even phys­ical mer­chand­ise for sale. NFTs are gate­ways to immers­ive com­munit­ies, social clubs, art col­lec­tions, games, spec­u­lat­ive fin­ance, gambling and a range of other pur­poses. Prac­tic­ally speak­ing, they dress up crypto­cur­ren­cies, such as Ether (ETH), in objects with more relat­able aes­thet­ics, such as cute Winter Bears.\n\nIf the block­chain rep­res­ents the mas­ter ledger under­ly­ing this new vis­ion of the inter­net, users com­ing together in these online com­munit­ies rep­res­ent indi­vidual cus­tom­ers con­greg­at­ing in mar­ket­places.

NFT com­munit­ies grow on plat­forms such as Dis­cord and Twit­ter, with products that sup­port people who live more of their lives online, in con­trast to Face­book and LinkedIn, which are bet­ter for help­ing people knit together digital con­nec­tions into their phys­ical lives. Just as suc­cess­ful NFT com­munit­ies find ways to reward their mem­bers, com­munity-focused plat­forms are think­ing about how they can reward the con­tent con­tri­bu­tions that their users make to the inter­net eco­nomy by token­iz­ing them. Red­dit, for example, is explor­ing how to token­ize karma points, which users can earn from con­trib­ut­ing use­ful com­ments that are upvoted by other mem­bers of the com­munity. They pro­pose to turn social cap­ital into actual cap­ital, and they are pro­mot­ing a vis­ion for the inter­net that is to some extent owned by com­munit­ies of users and gov­erned by token-hold­ers. (To be sure, this vis­ion impli­citly anti­cip­ates that plat­forms such as Red­dit, Face­book, You­Tube, Twit­ter and oth­ers are less respons­ible for mak­ing decisions about speech or the spread of dis­in­form­a­tion).\n\nWhile the block­chain is a tool that helps NFTs restruc­ture the value of digital objects, there are clear pit­falls in the prac­tice of trans­par­ency, immut­ab­il­ity and decent­ral­iz­a­tion. It can work as inten­ded, such as when the former head of product for OpenSea, the dom­in­ant NFT mar­ket­place, was accused of using con­fid­en­tial inform­a­tion to trade NFTs based on his trans­par­ent wal­let activ­it­ies (he resigned). Own­er­ship records are too abstract out­side of niche set­tings to verify iden­tity, so it’s easy for imposters to use avatars that sig­nal clout and status in order to scam oth­ers. Of course, that could change. For example, cent­ral­ized plat­forms such as Twit­ter might start to integ­rate and verify wal­lets that help people pro­tect and use their digital iden­tit­ies in mean­ing­ful ways. Sur­pris­ingly, when you buy an NFT, you aren’t actu­ally buy­ing a digital object — you’re buy­ing a link that points to that digital object. The record is what’s stored on the block­chain, not the image data, which can be more eph­em­eral.\n\nWhile the block­chain is a tool that helps NFTs restruc­ture the value of digital objects, there are clear pit­falls in the prac­tice of trans­par­ency, immut­ab­il­ity and decent­ral­iz­a­tion.

GxngYxng, the co-cre­ator and artist behind the GHXSTS col­lec­tion, told me that the per­man­ence of digital art on the block­chain is bet­ter than tra­di­tional paint­ing, both because you don’t have to main­tain and phys­ic­ally store it, and because it’s port­able. Tim Cara­m­bat, a soft­ware developer, took a more con­trarian approach when he cre­ated Decay­Punks, a small col­lec­tion of pieces that decay (lose pixels) every time they are sold or traded through a script embed­ded in them. He explained to me that every­one’s buy­ing NFTs because their asset own­er­ship is per­man­ent on the block­chain, but he adds, “I wanted to have it to where you have a piece and the more it’s manip­u­lated and traded between people, it fades away. It’s giv­ing less per­man­ence to the whole idea of the NFT, which is per­man­ence.”\n\nBlock­chains do not have to be the centre of a new inter­net, but NFTs are test­ing the broader pub­lic appet­ite for that idea. Des­pite flaws in the block­chain the­ory of own­er­ship, there is power­ful enthu­si­asm behind a vis­ion for a world that rewards the cul­ture com­munit­ies driv­ing the inter­net eco­nomy. NFTs and other tokens simply show us one method to get us there, and they give us an early glimpse into a fra­gile future where all digital objects are token­ized and owned. As early adop­ters take risks in their pur­suit of new mod­els, many of their ambi­tions will inev­it­ably res­ult in fail­ure. But the social tech­no­lo­gies they cre­ate are also ask­ing us to ima­gine inter­ven­tions that can help us build a web that works for more of us.\n\nBlock­chains do not have to be the centre of a new inter­net, but NFTs are test­ing the broader pub­lic appet­ite for that idea.

To incorporate this pattern in your DAO, [equip the mod](https://zodiac.wiki/index.php/Category:Exit_Pattern) through the Zodiac App available on Gnosis Safe, and then members can visit [exit.gnosisguild.org](https://exit.gnosisguild.org/) when they choose to exit.**_\n\n_**To learn more about and participate in the Zodiac ecosystem, follow [@gnosisguild](https://www.twitter.com/gnosisguild) and join the [Gnosis Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/gnosisguild).**_\n\nDAOs often prioritize their entrances, but what about their exits?\n\nIn late 2021, [ConstitutionDAO](https://www.constitutiondao.com/) memed itself into history when it bid on a copy of the U.S. Constitution. The speedrun DAO broke the record for the largest crowdfund for a physical object in a 72-hour period, onboarding thousands into crypto and raising nearly $43 million from 17.5K contributors. But after its failed bid, the lack of clarity over the refund process resulted in [confusion](https://twitter.com/ConstitutionDAO/status/1462588701410615300). Its exit plan, as it turns out, was not nearly as clear as its entrance.\n\nTo create new patterns around onboarding and offboarding, Gnosis Guild debuted the [Zodiac Exit Module](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-exit/get-started/), a modular exit mechanism similar to MolochDAO's rageQuit() functionality. Had ConstitutionDAO equipped its multisig Safe with the Exit Module, supporters could have redeemed their $PEOPLE tokens for a proportion of the Safe treasury’s digital assets, instantly and permissionlessly.\n\nThe good news is that exit patterns are already experiencing swift cultural development. Not even three months later, [AssangeDAO](https://assangedao.org/) [announced](https://assangedao.substack.com/p/updates-on-juicebox-funding-and-justice?utm_source=url) that it would equip the Exit Module to its Safe if its [historic bid](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/1491413075341512707) had not won, signaling perhaps the beginning of a new model.\n\nTwitter Embed\n\n[Visit this post on

New Exit Patterns\n\nToday, we continue to nurture new exit patterns with our latest contribution to the Zodiac open standard: the **[Exit App](https://exit.gnosisguild.org/)**. While the Exit Module allowed DAO operators to enable an exit mechanism, the Exit App provides DAO members a friendly interface to even more easily exit. This companion app now completes the Zodiac Exit pattern by offering interfaces for all of its functionalities.\n\n**Most significantly, the Zodiac Exit pattern now also supports NFT exits**. This means that, for the first time, members can redeem an NFT for their proportion of a Safe's treasury, a feature that would greatly benefit those currently unable to exit organizations whose membership is based on holding an NFT. One could imagine this in the case of storied NFT projects like [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/): the exit from one quest to spark the start of another.\n\n![NFT Exit](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jvck1Eu8ZGyAJVPqhSuyt.png)\n\nNFT Exit\n\n### A brief summary of what the Exit App enables:\n\n◍ **EASY EXITS:** While redeeming tokens was always possible on a contract level for Safes equipped with the Exit Module, the Exit App provides members a nice user interface to initiate the transaction. Exiting members can now simply log into the standalone Exit App at [exit.gnosisguild.org](https://exit.gnosisguild.org/) and leave a DAO with their proportion of tokens.\n\n◍ **NFT EXITS:** Members can now use NFTs to exit from organizations that use non-fungible tokens for membership. In this case, a Safe's assets are divided equally per NFT among an entire NFT collection. For example, if the circulating supply of an NFT collection is 2, the account redeeming one NFT will receive 50% of the Safe's assets.\n\n◍ **SAFE EXITS:** Members who hold a DAO's designated token in their own Safe can now easily exit too. In order to redeem, the member simply opens the Exit App as a Safe App, inputs the DAO's Safe address, and then selects the token(s) they want to claim.\n\n◍ **EXPERIMENTAL \"EXITS\":** The Exit Module, as a reminder, also has custom settings that can introduce new forms of DAO co-ownership and [holding in common](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/l3pGN7TOUgPkzeurDlllIaAocaVqQuZkN98-BLAhKRc), including decentralized token swaps and other DAO-to-DAO innovations. ✨ Experimentation is welcome. ✨\n\n## How to Use the Exit App\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lFtChXUQ7SkWliZ-ns-VM.png)\n\n1. **Navigate to the Exit App**\n\n• If you are a member exiting with a web3 wallet, visit the standalone version of the Exit App here: [exit.gnosisguild.org](https://exit.gnosisguild.org/).\n\n• If you are a member exiting a Safe while using a Safe account to store your redeemable assets, find the Exit App through the Safe Apps list in your Gnosis Safe.\n\n2. **Attach Safe and wallet**\n\nTo attach an Exit-enabled Safe, select the correct network at the top dropdown menu and enter the Safe's address into the `Account Address` field. (Note: The Exit App can only be used with Safes equipped with the Exit Module.) Next, attach your web3 wallet (e.g. MetaMask) by clicking on \"Connect Wallet\" in the left panel.\n\n3. **Designate token**\n\n• If exiting with an ERC-20 token, enter the amount that you would like to claim in the `Exit Amount` field in the left panel and click on the appropriate checkbox(es) under \"Select assets to claim\" in the right panel.\n\n• If exiting the DAO by redeeming an NFT (ERC-721), you must select the intended NFT to redeem by using the dropdown menu under \"Exit Token\" in the left panel and click on the appropriate checkbox(es) under \"Select assets to claim\" in the right panel.\n\n4. **Verify transaction details**\n\nVerify that the transaction details are correct, including the `Exit Token` and `Amount`, the claimable asset(s), and the `Claimable Value`.\n\n5. **Initiate & execute transaction**\n\nClick \"Exit and Claim Assets\" and then approve & execute the transaction with your web3 wallet. Once the transaction is completed, the transaction button in the Exit App will now say \"Exit Successful!\" The Exit App will update the values of both your balance and the attached Safe account's treasury.\n\n\n_For detailed step-by-step instructions, visit the [Zodiac documentation](https://zodiac.wiki/index.php/Category:Exit_Pattern)._\n\n## Exit as Emergence\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HnnBic8v12CX3jBLqXVXh.png)\n\nExiting a DAO remains a critical operating principle for decentralized organizations. As DAOs continue to experiment with new membership arrangements and engagement levels, their exit mechanisms should become as simple and as transparent as their entrance. The Exit App is another vital step on this pathway.\n\n_**The Zodiac Exit App completes the Zodiac Exit pattern, which allows DAO members to redeem a designated token for a proportion of a Safe’s treasury. To incorporate this pattern in your DAO, [equip the mod](https://zodiac.wiki/index.php/Category:Exit_Pattern) through the Zodiac App available on Gnosis Safe, and then members can visit [exit.gnosisguild.org](https://exit.gnosisguild.org/) when they choose to exit.**_\n\n_**To learn more about and participate in the Zodiac ecosystem, follow [@gnosisguild](https://www.twitter.com/gnosisguild) and join the [Gnosis Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/gnosisguild).**_\n\n_**Security:**_ _The Zodiac Exit Mod and App audit has been performed by the G0 group.

The question of how we should be living differently is a gift.\n\nReflecting on the work of the past year, it’s clear that attention is building. As a [recent tweet said](https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1473146566768693256), “The first rule of Web3 fight club is you must always talk about Web3 fight club”. The signal-to-noise ratio may be lower than ever, but at the same time, acronyms like DAOs begin to take on public meaning. The question of how we should be working differently repeats.\n\nChoosing to spend my time working on DAOs, I have to continually revisit, reevaluate, and reinvigorate my aims. There are the short-term measurable indicators of success: total value managed by our tools. There are also mid-term navigation points: what will organizational forms look like in three decades from now, and what coordinated feats will they support? I embrace one theory of change that cultural norms, even more so than technical capabilities, influence our sphere of action. That is, while technical capabilities play a role in determining the possible, cultural norms curtail it more than we usually think.\n\nThough these technical capabilities do not usually ship with a sealed fate, they have cultural _potential_, a wide range of propensities from which some can be encouraged more than others. On this subtly charted course, more decisions do not always equal better decisions. Greater coordination can be to ill ends. The values we can encourage steer us toward rough consensus and running _worlds_. These worlds are not built on compliance but something more wild. What is wild can also be what is common.\n\nReflecting on the tools of the last year, web3 makes apparent the financialization that already influences our lives. The difference may be that we’re more aware of participating in it, for better and worse. Calls to fractionalize everything are a cultural potential of the technical capabilities that will over the next five years deeply reorient how we construe value. With this cultural potential, it may be important to remember: _holding in common_ does not mean dividing what is in practice valuable.\n\nFractionalization of artworks, for instance, does not inherently transgress the practice of holding in common, provided owners participate in shared events. However, the cultural norm of fractionalization may have runoff effects out of step with valuable experience, leading to equating granular ownership rights with ever more granular resources due to seemingly limitless address space. We do have an opportunity to reorient epistemological mappings through cryptonetworks. We only have to quickly turn to Elinor Ostrom’s [design principles of common pool resource management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom#Design_principles_for_Common_Pool_Resource_(CPR)_institution) to find alternative inspiration. These principles emphasize methods for clear definitions, dispute resolution, and collective self-determination. A key quality: in this mapping, access is collective, and responsibility is granular yet shared.\n\nIn most forms of law, the right to be a “legal person” also confers responsibility, such as the duty to represent oneself legally. A land rights action brought forward by the Onondaga Nation takes this one step further:\n\n> On March 11, 2005, the Onondaga Nation filed a complaint in a federal court in Syracuse seeking title to their lost homelands. \\[...\\] The lawsuit is not a land “claim,” because to the Onondaga land has far greater significance than the notion of property. Sid Hill, the Tadodaho, or spiritual leader, of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, has said that the Onondaga Nation will never seek to evict people from their homes. The Onondaga people know the pain of displacement too well to inflict it on their neighbors. Instead the suit is termed a “land rights action.” When they finally got their day in court last October, members of the Onondaga Nation argued that the land title they’re seeking is not for possession, not to exclude, but for the right to participate in the well-being of the land. Against the backdrop of Euro-American thinking, which treats land as a bundle of property rights, the Onondaga are asking for freedom to exercise their responsibility to the land. \\[ [1](https://orionmagazine.org/article/the-rights-of-the-land/)\\]\n\nWe can see in the Onondaga Nation’s land rights action how the idea of ownership becomes more variegated: a form of _holding in common_. As a collection of rights, ownership inextricably relates the concept of rights and responsibility. This widespread lack of disambiguation on the idea of ownership may be why the notion of art that remains publicly accessible but privately owned confounds so many. It also may be why the vision of the “ownership economy” requires further articulation.\n\nReflecting on long-term navigation points, I imagine scenarios based on the socio-technical infrastructure that will still exist in the next 200 years or even 2000 years. At the end of each imagination, I conclude that what may have the most impact on the future isn't decentralized digital technology alone but the governance patterns it culturally normalizes. Because even if the specific technical capabilities don't survive, but the broader network does, the cultural norms could remain too. In an essay from earlier this year, [A Prehistory of DAOs](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/t4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q), I tried to retrace the lineage of DAOs from dangerous roots to more convivial forms. In part, I intended to help a governance pattern seeded by others\\[ [2](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3356774)\\]\\[ [3](https://thereboot.com/beyond-cryptoeconomics-platform-cooperativism-and-the-future-of-blockchain-governance/)\\]\\[ [4](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3979223)\\] flourish more widely: DAOs should be in closer dialogue with cooperative models. As with all encouraged governance patterns, the chance persists that it could remain more superficially embraced, and cooperative models do not ultimately inform a greater number of DAOs on a [deeper operational level](https://resources.uwcc.wisc.edu/Business%20Conversion/Becoming%20Employee%20Owned%20Toolkit.pdf). As others have glibly noted, the impetus to place cooperatives on top of global capitalism looks paltry at best. These truths neglect an opportunity that needs to be reinforced, however, which new terms like DAOs create: spawning tremendous energy that could go toward stellar megaprojects and [cultivating community in empty lots](https://www.ustreetcommunity.org/temperance-alley). Structural change often proceeds at the pace of simple memes and right timing, provided there are tools available to sustain it.\n\n![James Webb Space Telescope (2021)](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/webb_spacecraft_sep_12.25.png)\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope (2021)\n\nChoosing to spend my time working on DAOs, my theory of change operates at a very slow pace, despite the fast tempo of “the space”. I do believe that governance patterns must begin relationally in the responsibilities we have to each other. These responsibilities are not burdens but something more wild. Power is necessary, and the tools are secondary. We have shared memories of history, however, precisely because of our relationships with tools we built to preserve those memories. Tools are important reinforcements, bound in a feedback loop with history. In trying to be a good ancestor, we can choose what governance patterns, along with their rights, responsibilities, and remembrances, to reinforce for those who come after us.\n\n_Thanks to Marvin Lin, Andy Tudhope, and the Other Internet Peer Review for sharing feedback on this reflection._\n\n_Cover Image: Max Ernst, Summer Night in Arizona (1944)_\n\n_This essay is by [@keikreutler](https://twitter.com/keikreutler?lang=de).

The first essay [Inventories, Not Identities](https://blog.gnosis.pm/inventories-not-identities-7da9a4ec5a3e) focuses on collective, composable web3 identity._\n\n_We at Gnosis Guild build Zodiac, the expansion pack for DAOs. **Join the [Gnosis Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/wwmBWTgyEq) today to continue the conversation.**_\n\nThe year is 1996. John Perry Barlow is about to declare, “The internet consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself” ( [1](https://www.eff.org/de/cyberspace-independence)).\n\nFrom the vantage point of today’s web, someone might argue that only the first part of Barlow’s statement is correct. The spectacle surrounding digital assets suggests that we’ve reached a new level of financialization, continuing a trajectory in which more of our actions online become direct economic interactions. While blockchain-based digital assets are amenable to speculative financial markets, they are not the only application of the technology. During this crest of the hype cycle, we could see relationships forged by new peer-to-peer institutions take root underneath.\n\n![An early world computer?

Ruzname-i dairevi astronomical tables for both the Arebi (Islamic) and Rumi (Julian) calendars providing chronological accounts of seasonal change, entry of the sun into signs of the zodiac, and times of summer and sunset. Image: Wellcome Collection\n\nOne of the first applications of public blockchains is global digital assets. Global in the sense that they do not rely on institutions to prove they are not being [double spent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending): the mystical cat on the moon NFT is, verifiably, the only mystical cat on the moon NFT corresponding to its token. The utility of provable uniqueness also extends to types of relations beyond direct economic exchange, which has led many people to think as much about new forms of finance as about new forms of organizations.\n\nYet the promise of new organizational forms aided by information technology cannot be separated from the context of the internet’s invention. In 1995, a year before John Perry Barlow’s [Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace](https://www.eff.org/de/cyberspace-independence), another written work that would impact the political ideology of the early internet appeared: [Tribes, Institutions, Markets, Networks (TIMN)](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2005/P7967.pdf) by David Ronfeldt. The TIMN report was funded by the RAND Corporation. Darkly parodied in _Dr. Strangelove_ as the BLAND Corporation, it is a non-profit, research and development think tank founded in 1948, which is responsible for informing the policies of the United States military, government, and industry to the present day. Because the internet begins amidst this militarized context, we will start here too ( [2](https://www.rand.org/about/history/baran.list.html)).\n\nThe TIMN report creates a narrative of societal evolution in which humans have progressed through four distinct organizational forms:\n\n![(T) Tribes have the societal organizing principle of kinship, clans, and lineages. (I) Institutions have the societal organizing principle of hierarchy. (M) Markets have the societal organizing principle of competitive exchange. (N) Networks have the societal organizing principle of heterarchic collaborative exchange. Heterarchic here denotes organizations that are non-hierarchical, unranked, or possess the ability to be ranked in multiple ways.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ccfc3b17-2054-4305-b705-bd23ec2e5598.png)\n\n(T) Tribes have the societal organizing principle of kinship, clans, and lineages. (I) Institutions have the societal organizing principle of hierarchy. (M) Markets have the societal organizing principle of competitive exchange. (N) Networks have the societal organizing principle of heterarchic collaborative exchange. Heterarchic here denotes organizations that are non-hierarchical, unranked, or possess the ability to be ranked in multiple ways.\n\nWhile new organizational forms evolve over time, preceding organizational forms “grow within their scope of activity, even though that scope is newly circumscribed”, citing how markets increased tax revenues to bolster the institutional state despite curtailing its participation in direct economic exchange ( [3](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2005/P7967.pdf)).\n\n![Sam Hart, Laura Lotti, Toby Shorin, Squad Wealth, 2020](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/80498627-0fad-4e56-9afe-848f8f50a539.png)\n\nSam Hart, Laura Lotti, Toby Shorin, Squad Wealth, 2020\n\nThe report’s institutional biases are clear, such as equating progress with Western liberal democracy, and its narrative of societal evolution may appear reductive at best. Its argument, however, provides an historical background to the political ideology from which decentralized organizations draw, knowingly or not. This is most apparent in the report’s identification of the newest organizational form: networks.\n\nThe report defines networks somewhat open-endedly. A key distinguishing feature between networks and the organizational forms preceding them is that networks are described as _**multi-organizational**_, emphasizing collaboration between “small, scattered, and autonomous” groups over larger distances. These groups do not necessarily share a distinct organizational unity. While networks have existed throughout history, new information technology emphasizes cooperative relations that greatly impact institutions by cutting across jurisdictions, “facilitating the growth of [keiretsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiretsu) and other distributed, web-like global enterprises and, increasingly, so-called ‘virtual corporations’”, Ronfeldt notes ( [4](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2005/P7967.pdf)). Yet multi-organizational networks’ primary domain is neither the public nor private sector, at least as both are traditionally conceived. Instead, they will most transform a third, “autonomous social sector” (5), identified in the report as civil society. Painted in the 1995 landscape to include non-governmental organizations (NGOs), grassroots organizations, and private voluntary organizations, civil society will be strengthened by multi-organizational networks and perhaps address issues surrounding inequality, bureaucracy, and accessibility where preceding organizational forms failed.\n\nThe report presents a saccharine political image of networks: “While the development of the institutional and market forms of organization led to an emphasis on competitive advantages, development of the multi-organizational network form may shift the emphasis to cooperative advantages” ( [6](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2005/P7967.pdf)). The underside of this political presentation is the imperial soft power NGOs would globally export in the following decade. For those currently working on web3, all of this language may feel familiar, although this questionable ideological inheritance often goes unremarked ( [7](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703983004575073911147404540)). By surfacing ideological lineages, we stand a greater chance to change their course.\n\nWith the report’s final emphasis on civil society’s three letter acronyms for organizations, NGOs, NPOs, and PVOs, a future one is naturally missing: DAOs.\n\n## A Chimeric Term\n\nDAO stands for _decentralized autonomous organization_.\n\nDAO comes from imagining how features of decentralized technology, such as global digital assets, censorship resistance, and automated actions, will change how organizations operate. Initially called _[decentralized autonomous corporations](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bootstrapping-a-decentralized-autonomous-corporation-part-i-1379644274)_ (DACs), the more generalizable term DAO emerged from the Ethereum blockchain community. Based on Vitalik Buterin’s [DAOs, DACs, DAs and More: An Incomplete Terminology Guide](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/) from 2014, a DAO could be described then as a capitalized organization in which a software protocol informs its operation, placing automation at its center and humans at its edges. For example, a software protocol could specify the conditions upon which an organization automatically distributes capital to its members. This led to the idea that organizational values could be automated and executed by code, a lingering idea that perhaps falsely suggests [tacit knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge) can be fully expressed in a software protocol. While the term’s hypothetical ideas abounded, by the time a DAO went from theory into experiment, the community largely reframed the term DAO to indicate “unstoppable”, or censorship-resistant, businesses. The first DAO, called [The DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)), became one of the biggest spectacles in the Ethereum blockchain community to date when in 2016 it raised over $150m equivalent in ETH as a decentralized venture fund (8). However, the experiment proved short-lived when The DAO was hacked one month after launch.\n\nLarger initiatives related to DAOs would not gain traction again for several years. From then until now, DAO strayed from its initial signifiers to continue as a chimeric term, with both the term and its implementations varying depending on its cultural context. Each speculative run in the market, for all its noise, creates new signals of what DAOs can be deployed towards, bringing descriptive, technical, and cultural refinement to the concept in practice. While some quip that a group splitting a lunch bill may be a DAO, in order to avoid its overgeneralization ( [9](https://j.mirror.xyz/RUeJfZEZxr-hkuzUCakQyUuf2kOJVMPPiAWBaQFhhqc)), the focus on DAOs will be limited to examples in the Ethereum blockchain community, despite the importance of other [communities similarly coordinating](https://twitter.com/helveticade/status/1400946733249662978). In 2021, a DAO _could_ be described as a voluntary association with the operating principles of digital cooperativism. As voluntary associations, they are a cross-jurisdictional way for strangers, friends, or unlikely allies to pseudonymously come together toward common goals, supported by a token model, incentives, and governance. Members of a DAO can have representative ownership of its digital assets through a token, which often simultaneously acts as a governance right and network utility.\n\nAlthough many DAOs would not embrace the label of digital cooperative, one could say DAOs embrace cooperativism as a _protocol_, meaning an evolving set of relational practices that are distinct from traditional corporate structures or decentralized autonomous corporations, because they prioritize member ownership. The label cooperative can be qualified by digital because today DAOs act primarily to coordinate around digital assets. However, as the concept of DAOs evolves in practice, [its digital primacy will fade](https://medium.com/regen-network/community-stake-governance-model-b949bcb1eca3). DAOs, as we will see, also introduce new dimensions that exceed what the operating principles of a digital cooperative notionally encompass.\n\nDecentralized technology ecosystems tend to describe a phenomenon through its technical products. Yet as Ruth Catlow, co-founder of Furtherfield and DECAL decentralized arts lab, notes, “We need to be building cultures before structures” ( [10](https://so-far.online/many-headed-hydras/)). While the overview below of DAO tools provides a concrete description of the concept in practice, it feels critical to keep in mind that DAOs ultimately coordinate through collective vibes.\n\n![DAO Starter Pack, 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b277c810-3d61-4766-979c-af9d8b063e7e.png)\n\nDAO Starter Pack, 2021\n\nIn its simplest form, DAO tools have been described as a group chat and a bank account ( [11](https://www.patreon.com/posts/wyoming-dao-bill-51387956)). In 2021, this generally takes the form of a Discord server and a [Gnosis Safe Multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/), which is a web3 platform for creating [multi-signature accounts](https://blog.gnosis.pm/inventories-not-identities-7da9a4ec5a3e). Multi-signature accounts allow pseudonymous groups, across jurisdictions, to pool and manage funds within minutes, a capacity far beyond a [traditional joint bank account](https://twitter.com/ctbeiser/status/1399196774967898113). This “minimum viable” DAO tooling shone in the first half of 2021 with initiatives like PleasrDAO.\n\n[PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/pleasrdao?lang=de) is a collective that came together to bid on an NFT by the artist [pplpleasr](https://foundation.app/pplpleasr). Given escalating digital art auction prices, the idea behind PleasrDAO was simple: a collective of fans using a multi-signature account could pool funds to place bids, and through holding in common, compete with other major bidders to win the auction. After winning their first eponymous auction, PleasrDAO went on to collect other works such as [Stay Free](https://foundation.app/Snowden/stay-free-edward-snowden-2021-24437), the NFT by Edward Snowden charitably supporting independent press, for a total of 2.2K ETH or USD 5.4 Million equivalent at the time. Their repeatedly successful missions means that while still acting as collectors, PleasrDAO will [broaden their scope](https://decrypt.co/66933/why-this-dao-bought-snowden-nft) to begin incubating projects by their community. Initiatives like PleasrDAO most promisingly challenge institutional collectors through their expanded membership, inviting artists they collect like pplpleasr to become members of the collective in turn. However, for this to be the case, it is vital this ownership remains collective rather than institutional.\n\n![Gnosis Safe multi-signature account owned by PleasrDAO, in which they hold collected NFTs in common.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c9904c31-747e-4b83-aee1-0a2208b1f338.png)\n\nGnosis Safe multi-signature account owned by PleasrDAO, in which they hold collected NFTs in common.\n\nThough a group chat and multi-signature account may be enough to initialize a DAO mission, a token often becomes the next step toward embracing the principles of a digital cooperative. For example, PleasrDAO issued $PEEPS, a token distributed internally to represent members’ stake in the collection ( [12](https://foundation.app/blog/pleasrdao)), which they are considering making public to fractionalize ownership of their collection. Similar experiments like [PartyDAO](https://twitter.com/prtydao?lang=de) employ a token, with the $PARTY token representing membership to a group chat, governance rights, and co-ownership of productive value managed by the DAO. It’s important to note PleasrDAO and PartyDAO are not flat hierarchies, as they both have elected groups of individuals that manage their multi-signature account treasuries. Though PleasrDAO and PartyDAO focused on shorter missions initially, they are both evolving toward a longer term vision, as collectors, investors, and incubators that use tokens to represent co-ownership in the spirit of a digital cooperative. Tokenization creates both opportunities and challenges for the networks to come.\n\n### A New Dimension in the Cooperative Movement\n\nReturning to their origin, DAOs today resemble _The_ _DAO_ mainly in their emphasis on open participation and economic value creation, while their culture has shifted much more toward specific niches and social connection. In the examples above, one term has been left intentionally vague: governance. Many DAOs today use the lightweight [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) platform for governance ( [13](https://deepdao.io/#/deepdao/dashboard)). On Snapshot, DAOs each have a space to create and vote on proposals. For example, both [PleasrDAO](https://snapshot.org/#/pleasrdao.eth) and [PartyDAO](https://snapshot.org/#/partydao.eth) have a Snapshot space, on which they hold public votes for collective decisions. Snapshot weights votes by the amount of DAO-specific tokens an address holds, such as $PEEPS tokens in PleasrDAO.\n\n![PleasrDAO Snapshot space displaying the vote on whether to acquire the Dreaming at Dusk NFT benefitting the Tor Project. The vote passed with a total of 396.69k $PEEPS tokens voting in favor. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f09da5e4-c7e9-4dd4-b736-f6a504f02606.png)\n\nPleasrDAO Snapshot space displaying the vote on whether to acquire the Dreaming at Dusk NFT benefitting the Tor Project. The vote passed with a total of 396.69k $PEEPS tokens voting in favor.\n\nThe [topic of governance](https://technosphere-magazine.hkw.de/p/The-Byzantine-Generalization-Problem-Subtle-Strategy-in-the-Context-of-Blockchain-Governance-8UNNcM8VShTpBGWRuob1GP) has its own history within the crypto ecosystem that won’t be fully expounded upon here. Notably the initiative [MolochDAO](https://www.molochdao.com/), which uses the classic font Papyrus and heavily references gaming guilds, rekindled the fire of decentralized governance after The DAO hack. MolochDAO went on to inspire a legion of new DAOs, many direct forks of its codebase, in its wake.\n\nThis essay’s history of DAOs is far from complete, as other projects like [Aragon](https://aragon.org/), [Colony](https://colony.io/), [DAOhaus](https://daohaus.club/), and [DAOstack](https://daostack.io/) continue to develop their platforms for DAOs and modular initiatives like [Block Science](https://block.science/) and [Commons Stack](https://commonsstack.org/) arise. These projects offer DAO tools supporting many [governance mechanisms](https://blog.gnosis.pm/a-brief-discussion-of-the-protocol-governing-the-dxdao-7331407a2555). However, a prehistory of DAOs is also incomplete without its less frequently mentioned relation to platform cooperativism.\n\nBuilding on decades of commons initiatives, the term “platform cooperativism” coined by Trebor Scholz as well as the concept “ [exit to community](https://hackernoon.com/startups-need-a-new-option-exit-to-community-ig12v2z73)” outlined by Nathan Schneider have intersected with the crypto space through essays like Jesse Walden’s [The Ownership Economy](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/). These catchphrases advocate for platforms owned, developed, and stewarded by their community of users. Specifically, the concept “exit to community” influenced decentralized governance through its clear exposition of a third way for companies to evolve their ownership.\n\n![Nathan Schneider, Startups Need a New Option: Exit to Community, 2019](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d14efc42-4c3c-4e7b-a6c9-b760a118e7c5.jpeg)\n\nNathan Schneider, Startups Need a New Option: Exit to Community, 2019\n\nExit to community grew in practice through initiatives such as [DXdao](https://twitter.com/dxdao_?lang=de), which launched with the aim to give community ownership, governance, and value to software protocols. Today, with many decentralized finance software protocols guiding their development through DAOs, it's become clear that software protocols can both exit to and [build with community](https://twitter.com/VENTURE_DAO/status/1395544596550062080). Because DAOs use early stage software tools, it makes sense that their first users and use cases would involve the governance of digital assets, such as software protocols. DAOs’ digital primacy is perhaps one reason that their resemblance to earlier cooperative movements often goes unremarked.\n\nToday, the International Cooperative Alliance defines cooperatives as “an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise” ( [14](https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity)). A cooperative can also be defined by the structure of its legal entity, which dictates that cooperatives are companies not owned by shareholders but by their members. The establishment of the [Rochdale Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles), formulated by a society of weavers in 1844, marked a key moment in the history of cooperatives. The International Cooperative Alliance adopted these operating principles, which still guide cooperatives globally:\n\n1. Voluntary and Open Membership\n2. Democratic Member Control\n3. Member Economic Participation\n4. Autonomy and Independence\n5. Education, Training, and Information\n6. Cooperation among Cooperatives\n7. Concern for Community\n\nWhile these operating principles have evolved over the last two centuries, they could easily have been formulated by some DAOs today. The principles of Voluntary and Open Membership, Member Economic Participation, and Concern for Community translate to the examples of DAOs above. The principles of Autonomy and Independence and Cooperation among Cooperatives are key for DAOs to flourish as multi-organizational networks, strengthening an autonomous social sector built through cross-DAO collaboration.\n\nDAOs could set more thoughtful norms around democratic member control, which cooperatives typically define as one member, one vote. Most DAOs employ token voting, that is, one token, one vote. DAOs reason that token ownership represents stakeholdership, with the token model often directly economically tied to the DAO, for example through fees on software protocols it owns. This allows DAO members with greater financial stake to have proportionally greater influence. Token voting does not directly contradict cooperative principles, as there are some cooperatives that weight votes by qualities such as production ( [15](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3356774)). In certain cases this may feel apt, but as some DAOs evolve toward maintaining basic infrastructure such inequality becomes clearly undesirable. In part, this is because not all stakeholders have the purchasing power representative of their stake, and their practical knowledge may be excluded from governance. This should be solved by shifting the culture toward more decision making mechanisms that [decouple economic interest from governance rights](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html).\n\nUntil then, projects such as Tornado Cash privacy protocol have approached this distribution problem by retroactively sending tokens to prior users, in a step toward making users stakeholders of the protocol ( [16](https://tornado-cash.medium.com/tornado-cash-governance-proposal-a55c5c7d0703)). The [Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/) project, a public blockchain for ecosystem services, takes another approach to this distribution problem. They have set aside 30% of their tokens for land stewards, climate scientists, and other stakeholders in regenerative land management to form [community DAOs](https://medium.com/regen-network/community-stake-governance-model-b949bcb1eca3) that participate in network governance. Because tokens can be distributed more easily than traditional corporate interests, memberships, or shares, this creates the possibility for a new form of token holder company, which can incorporate deeper practical knowledge in governance without increasing operational transaction costs. Stakeholders with practical knowledge, or [“tacit” knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge), like land stewards in the case of Regen Network, benefit governance by incorporating informal practices in decision making. Here, DAOs begin to introduce new dimensions that exceed what the operating principles of a digital cooperative notionally encompass. For this reason, as much innovation and emphasis should be placed on token distribution mechanisms that identify broader stakeholder participation as on decision making mechanisms.\n\nThe tokenization of online communities could be the subject of a longer debate. Far from the best answer to the social media woes of web 2.0, tokenization introduces more awareness of financialized relations. As a guiding star, web3 applications could aim to introduce value in relations which have been historically denied it, such as labor and environment, rather than creating new financialized relations. In this context, for DAOs with the mission of economic value creation, a token becomes a useful mechanism on three fronts:\n\n1. Bootstrapping Funding\n2. Distributing Governance Rights\n3. Aligning Ecosystem of DAOs\n\nTokenization introduces a powerful _cultural_ norm into early stage organizations: the expectation of transparent co-ownership of its assets from the start. The tension between more traditional corporate structures that pay dividends and DAOs persists ( [17](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/)). Because most DAOs represent governance rights through a token, in some sense tokens have the ability to Trojan horse principles of cooperatives directly into highly financialized spaces. These are two important sides of, quite literally, one coin, and for this reason, tokenization should not be dismissed. Tokens may be one key to unlock the ownership economy, but to reach a more equitable version of this future, we must participate in crafting the culture around token distribution, mediation, and governance now. This becomes important because, unlike shares in cooperatives, many tokens that double as governance rights can be sold on secondary markets. While this makes the conditions for entrance into an organization easier, DAOs can learn from cooperatives’ emphasis on long termism, through establishing more cultural patterns around token vesting, limited transferability, or more experimental mechanisms.\n\nJust as DAOs can learn from case studies of cooperatives, in a two-way exchange DAOs could introduce more forms of decentralized governance into cooperatives. This is the case made by Morshed Mannan in [Fostering Worker Cooperatives with Blockchain Technology: Lessons from the Colony Project](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3356774), which cites how cooperatives often face “coordination problems as the entity scales across borders,” with a “negative trend in participatory management, mutual monitoring, and solidarity” as they internationalize. Dilemmas that cooperatives face, such as funding, governance, and alignment across jurisdictions, DAOs directly address. Embracing cooperativism as a _protocol_ rather than as a corporate structure, DAOs could, in their neologism, encourage a cultural space that can be crafted beyond traditional divides.\n\n## The Guilded Age\n\nAs much as DAOs may accidentally embrace the operating principles of cooperatives preceding them, they also slyly resemble enclaves from other online cultures. They have the most to learn from guilds in massively multiplayer online games (MMOs).\n\nAs role playing computer games went online in the 1990s, this meant large numbers of players could share in one game world: an environment with a diverse array of objectives, activities, and subplots. Early integral examples of MMOs include The Realm Online, Ultima Online, and EverQuest, which lead to more classics like World of Warcraft and EVE Online. In many of these examples, players are mostly free to set their own goals loosely guided by the open game world narrative, affordances, and risks ( [18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_game)), and because of this narrative freedom, players form groups to accomplish common goals out of the reach of single players. Referred to broadly as guilds, clans, or alliances, these groups can range from 40 to 1000 participants, and their goals could include defeating difficult enemies or constructing useful tools.\n\nTo accomplish these goals, cultural patterns emerge in guilds, and there can sometimes be a mismatch between the tools game world developers release for guilds and their actual needs. In an example from EVE Online, the game world developers created an interface for players to create corporations that allowed players to distribute shares. In practice, this feature to distribute shares was rarely used because it did not enhance existing cultural patterns. Instead, using EVE Online’s in-game browser and data API, many guilds developed their own tools needed to accomplish specific goals (19). A parallel between gaming guilds and DAOs could be drawn here, as the current wave of DAOs tend to use a combination of composable tools, such as bridging the Snapshot voting platform to a Gnosis Safe multi-signature account, rather than platforms which overly anticipate use cases for participants.\n\nThough the specific feature to distribute corporate shares may not have taken off in EVE Online, gaming guilds frequently embrace economic practices of redistribution. The vast importance of MMO marketplaces, from [Varrock](https://runescape.salmoneus.net/archived-projects-and-content/site-content/tips/world-1-trading.html) to [gold farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming), for decentralized finance will be the subject of a later essay, but one economic practice may be keenly relevant for DAOs: Dragon-kill points (DKP). Taking their name historically from when dragons were the most frequently encountered enemies in MMOs, DKP emerged as an allocation system within and sometimes across guilds.\n\nComplex, sustained missions undertaken by guilds, such as killing a dragon, are usually referred to as raids, and can range in length from several hours to several days. At the end of a raid, the slain enemy drops in-game items called loot, and guilds must decide how to distribute it. Because guilds require diverse and complementary player skill sets over extended time periods, “It matters that the same people work together again” ( [20](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958945)) and it’s important that guilds distribute loot in a way that members perceive as fair. As guilds grow in maturity, they often evolve different systems of loot distribution, for example beginning with random distribution, moving toward random distribution weighted by participation, and commonly arriving at distribution through an informal scoring system such as DKP. DKP act as a private money system, separate from existing currency in a game world, and guild members earn them based on their participation in raids ( [21](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958945)). Guild members can then choose to spend these points in exchange for loot after a raid.\n\nInitially designed by a guild in 1999 for the EverQuest MMO, the [practice of DKP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_kill_points) has been embraced by many guilds across many game worlds, albeit with slight adjustments. Ed Castranova and Joshua Fairfield detailed one example in [Dragon Kill Points: A Summary Whitepaper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958945): the Leftovers DKP system, which maximizes the number of participants in the system not being tied to one specific guild. As Castranova and Fairfield write, “Indeed, this organization is effectively the highest allocative body in the population. If there is an emergent government on \\[the World of Warcraft server\\] Silver Hand, it is The Leftovers.” The Leftovers DKP system arises from a few limitations: loot can only be picked up at the aftermath of battle and, in World of Warcraft, cannot be transferred between players. The Leftovers DKP system has a small group of informally appointed governors: players who laboriously, through public dialogue, set and maintain a database of loot item prices in DKP. When loot drops, players with DKP can choose to spend them for a specific item, with all bids and transactions public. Being zero sum, the Leftovers DKP system then equally distributes _spent_ DKP points to all other guild members that participated in the raid.\n\nAs Castranova and Fairfield note, DKP supplements the existing currencies of a game world, as much for efficient allocation as for social cohesion, “making possible the exchange of time (spent on those raids in which an individual is not compensated) for goods (obtained on those raids in which an individual wins loot)” ( [22](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958945)). Especially in the case of World of Warcraft, because loot cannot be transferred between players, having loot also serves a strong signalling function itself, showing a player has meaningfully participated in raids over time. This DKP system precedes the mechanics of DAO platforms in development today, such as Aragon, Colony, and DAOstack, which all offer mechanisms to distribute reputational tokens based on the participation of members, who are rewarded for successful proposals, grants, or campaigns: what might be called raids in other game worlds. These reputational tokens complement other economic systems enabled by DAO platforms, such as DAO-specific tokens or other assets in their multi-signature account treasuries. Often used as an alternative model to the plutocratic one token, one vote model, reputational tokens, earned through participation rather than purchasing power, provide greater voting power in DAOs that amasses over time. DAOs can learn from DKP, which in contrast, acts as a private money system based on participation that can be spent on other digital assets, instead of only amassing over time.\n\nIn addition to efficient allocation, contextual reputation, and signalling functions, the DKP system holds another significance for DAOs: generally all guilds resolve disputes independently from traditional court systems, despite these disputes involving expensive stakes. This becomes highly relevant for DAO tooling like Aragon’s digital jurisdictions or [Kleros](https://kleros.io/)’s decentralized arbitration service that aim to provide internet native dispute resolution tools. In fact, DAO tooling often tries to technically solve problems that gaming guilds have already culturally refined for several decades, and it may be time for DAOs and gaming guilds to merge their practical knowledge more closely.\n\n![A collage of alliance logos in EVE Online, 2006](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5504ac03-20c1-4dba-83a6-efda8d3a4077.jpg)\n\nA collage of alliance logos in EVE Online, 2006\n\nAnother subtle cultural pattern of gaming guilds relates to their articulated economic structure. As researcher Joshua Citarella points out, many DKP systems resemble a form of market socialism, in which goods are publicly owned but allocated by markets ( [23](https://soundcloud.com/joshuacitarella/memes-as-politics-ep-13-dkp-is-market-socialism)). Citarella also goes on to note that despite the resemblance of DKP systems to market socialism, and the general happiness of players who participate in them, many of those players would decidedly not politically embrace the label market socialism. Shadow economics may be an apt term for when a group operates through an economic form it would not label itself as: DAOs as cooperative protocols and gaming guilds as market socialism. This tendency leaves interesting political territory like gaming guilds underexplored, because gaming guilds do not often need to wear their own flags. In one light, this could be more of a feature than a bug, as the invention of new terms like DAO, rather than reliance on canon, in part fuels their enthusiastic embrace.\n\nWhile it may result in ignoring their prehistory, DAOs still retain a powerful ambiguity, in which their burgeoning political ambitions do not yet possess fully familiar aesthetic articulations. This could be co-opted toward several different ends. For example, one could imagine a DAO whose treasury self-destructs, [like terra0's NFT](https://terra0.medium.com/two-degrees-nft-5af1263bfcc), when global temperatures rise over 2 degrees Celsius, accompanied by a sparkly, unassuming mascot avatar.\n\nSuch a DAO might attract participation from those not drawn to the familiar green aesthetics of most climate initiatives, and it could have the effect of broadening participation in a political objective through creating new cultures around it. The momentum of the questionably new can always be good for something, and the question becomes how to cultivate DAOs that can build surreptitious solidarity across ideological divides.\n\n## A Constellation is Born\n\n![Actually, it might be.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/482156a6-7f32-475a-b467-0e0b8c4648c7.png)\n\nActually, it might be.\n\nWhile a comprehensive prehistory of decentralized autonomous organizations could take us much further into the past ( [24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_Saint_Benedict)), many proponents of DAOs have a core belief about their impact on the future: DAOs could out-compete by out-cooperating the modern firm.\n\nIn the twentieth century, many economists asked why companies arose when services priced by the market should, in theory, be more efficient. Ronald Coase explored the answer to this question in [The Nature of the Firm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm), coming to the conclusion that markets create unaccounted for transaction costs. These transaction costs could arise from price discovery, contract negotiation, or onboarding for a service, which can be mitigated by retaining services in a company. Following from this theory, the size of firms may have practical limits they won’t exceed, because eventually transaction costs increase through developments like departmental bureaucracy. Though this theory has many critiques, the promise of DAOs can be positioned in relation to it: DAOs aspire to become _more_ efficient as they scale ( [25](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-daostack/blob/master/dxdao_whitepaper_v1.pdf)). While in practice this aspiration has been far from proven, in some respects the promise of DAOs lies in using technical governance protocols to reduce transaction costs. To return to an example above, DAO tooling like Gnosis Safe enables pseudonymous groups, across jurisdictions, to pool and manage funds within minutes. The equivalent process to establish a traditional joint bank account could take months, and in some cases, it wouldn’t be possible for individuals from different jurisdictions to jointly manage a bank account. Through the affordances of public blockchains, DAOs can incorporate deeper practical knowledge in governance without increasing operational transaction costs: aspiring to become “more efficient” as they scale.\n\nWhile DAO tooling like Gnosis Safe enables this today, overall the promise of infinitely scalable organizations still has a long way to go. Often even the promise of DAOs can obscure their utility in practice. In [The Dissensus Protocol: Governing Differences in Online Peer Communities](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fhumd.2021.641731/full), Jaya Klara Brekke, Kate Beecroft, and Francesca Pick focus on a case study of the Genesis DAO, a collective centered around the DAOstack platform. They write:\n\n> The Genesis DAO is a good example of a unique trait common to many DAOs, namely, that they comprise highly motivated groups that have formed around a set of ideas about governance, rather than governance being a means in order to achieve some shared mission. In other words, it was tool-centric and focused on one main action: allocating funds to proposals. It is unusual for people who are strangers to start making financial decisions together immediately without having time to develop coherence and trust. And this was in fact the very promise of projects like the Genesis DAO: that the technology would bypass the need to develop trusted relationships, meaning thousands of people would be able to coalesce around objectives, take actions, and even spend money together as a group ( [26](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fhumd.2021.641731/full)).\n\nMuch like the earlier example above of EVE Online players not using the interface to distribute corporate shares released by the game developers, tool-centric development, as well as the assumption that tools automatically create useful cultural patterns, must be reconsidered. Rather than technical protocols for governance that diminish the need for trusted relationships, DAOs can be approached through iteratively developing highly composable tools to coordinate across different levels of coherence and trust. Ultimately, the efficiency DAOs aspire to may not be defined as an economic function but as a matter of “better,” situated governance: one supported by deeper practical knowledge within an [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games).\n\n## Layers of the DAO\n\nDAOs will not be the uniformly non-hierarchical networks some imagine. Instead, DAOs coordinate across different levels of coherence and trust. In [Ownership in Cryptonetworks](https://blog.curvelabs.eu/ownership-in-cryptonetworks-96f13f4a113e), Patrick Rawson argues that for DAOs, “distributing ownership to squadlike entities with more specialized objectives is the key long-term problem to solve” in order to enable meaningful work. These “squadlike entities” are smaller teams with trust relationships, perhaps not unlike the gaming guilds in the examples above, which execute on value aligned missions with DAOs. At a closer look, effective DAOs start behaving much more like networks of teams, like the [MONDRAGON Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation) network with 100 affiliated cooperatives, rather than the loosely coordinated swarm intelligence that they might appear as from a distance. Inspired by Rawson’s analysis, we can roughly sketch three layers of a DAO:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e7260512-1458-4aac-bc0a-cbca9d6d532d.png)\n\n1. **Token**: Multi-organizational networks aligned by token ownership\n2. **Teams**: Teams, guilds, and squads represented by token ownership\n3. **Missions**: Missions, milestones, and raids financed by token ownership\n\nFrom these layers, a _**heterarchical**_ network emerges, meaning an organization that possesses the ability to be ranked in multiple ways.\n\n![An example of DAOs in which tokens, teams, and missions are distributed across several DAO networks, which can be ranked or assorted in multiple ways.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3aedd8d4-58c2-4273-bc91-3761d7f8a995.png)\n\nAn example of DAOs in which tokens, teams, and missions are distributed across several DAO networks, which can be ranked or assorted in multiple ways.\n\nIn ecosystems that prioritize distributing ownership, tokens encourage DAO networks to be managed by their members. Tokens, teams, and missions are not confined to the quasi-institutional boundaries of a single DAO but can and, in order to meaningfully decentralize the control network, _should_ be represented by token ownership in multiple DAOs. An ecosystem not unlike the control networks of transnational corporations emerges, but importantly, one without monocentric command and with reduced transaction costs across different levels of trust. As Rawson writes, “As long as the collective memory freely circulates within a given \\[DAO network\\], discovered solutions to problems can be reused.” When we view DAOs as multi-organizational networks aligned by token ownership, the purpose of DAO tooling becomes not only to support the operations of one team but to facilitate collaborations across many. Funded by PrimeDAO, [DAO-to-DAO (D2D) collaboration mechanisms](https://medium.com/primedao/exploring-dao2dao-collaboration-mechanisms-c37218a17a21) appear the most forward thinking work along these lines, which may eventually overtake traditional business-to-business (B2B) products. A new squadlike entity emerging from stealth mode, the [Gnosis Guild](https://twitter.com/gnosisguild?lang=de) team embraces a similar emphasis on DAO-to-DAO tools, with a new constellation of DAO tools called [Zodiac](http://).\n\nRevisiting the promise of DAOs, their potential to incorporate deeper practical knowledge in governance does not mean that decision making must involve an ever-larger number of members in every proposal, but rather that within a DAO network, teams who possess the most relevant expertise can easily share it with the ecosystem. When we view DAOs as constellations of teams, not monoliths, DAOs become networks to allow collective memory to flow freely.\n\n## The Networks to Come\n\nThe TIMN RAND report this essay began with closes on a curious note. It reads:\n\n> Much of the literature about redesigning organizations for the information-age focuses on production—on improving productivity, or manufacturing something new like the Boeing 777 jetliner. Yet, does this not reflect a lingering industrial-age mentality? Production organizations remain a crucial part of the organizational ecology. However, we should also be thinking about “sensory organizations.” Sensory functions are quite different from production functions, and require different modes of organization—e.g., more networks connected to the world outside an office’s boundaries. Determining appropriate designs for all manner of sensory organizations may become a good meta-theme for innovative research and development in the years ahead ( [27](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2005/P7967.pdf)).\n\nThis closing sentiment echoes the popularity in that era of the twentieth century media theorist Marshall McLuhan, who emphasized how digital media impacts our sensory nervous systems. If digitally prime networks like DAOs operate on our nervous system first, it does not mean they won’t come to reorganize, reshape, and redistribute our material world. Some still refuse to take seriously the fact that cooperative principles, gaming guilds, and odd imaginaries like DAOs present an emergent organizational form with legitimate political relevance. We must take them politically seriously now, so that they don’t remain shaped only by those on one side of the digital divide. The days of DAOs versus [PACs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee), political action committees that fundraise for electoral candidates in the United States, will be with us soon. Just as markets did not make states obsolete, but diminished some of their operations while strengthening others, DAOs introduce new forms into traditional political participation that emerge from the autonomous social sector: [the network union](https://1729.com/network-union/).\n\n![Character from Trust’s Mascot Streams, ARB  and GVN908, 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f59011fe-b6aa-42e6-9344-daab85c5976a.jpg)\n\nCharacter from Trust’s Mascot Streams, ARB and GVN908, 2021\n\nTo call attention to the chimeric’s term failings at seriousness, many return to its misnomer: the “A” in DAO does not live up to the meaning of autonomous; while others like researcher [Aude Launay invoke](https://twitter.com/audelau/status/1413731529042321410) the political, rather than the technical, spirit of autonomy in DAOs. Even though the term DAO remains poetically correct, we could propose an occasional replacement: decentralized avatar organizations. Such organizations would take their political stakes both lightly and heavily. As poetitician and Digital Minister of Taiwan Audrey Tang notes, the days of avatar politicians are already here ( [28](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/radical-transparency-humor-disinformation-poetry-for-machines-avatar-politicians-and-giving-non-human-entities-a-vote-with-digital-minister-of-taiwan-audrey-tang-X36XnWVg)). Avatar politicians are [virtual beings](https://www.virtual-beings-summit.com/) that represent, rally, and advocate on behalf of political platforms, and when automation increases, they may even spawn their own political platforms. A decentralized avatar organization would recognize the coming virtual zeitgeist: this could look like a [collectively managed cyborg](https://twitter.com/cjliu49/status/1345110226744184833) like [Lil Miquela](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Miquela) or an entire environment shaped by members, like [Trust’s moving castles](https://trust.support/). Decentralized avatar organizations will have collectively developed, interoperable game worlds, engines, or virtual being mascots at their core, which co-creates the culture around which their members organize.\n\n![Jay Springett, worldrunning.guide: A Speculative Document About Worlding Worlds, and Running Them, 2020-](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6fa40349-2cd0-41c2-8680-ffde9154743b.png)\n\nJay Springett, worldrunning.guide: A Speculative Document About Worlding Worlds, and Running Them, 2020-\n\nBy learning from their prehistory, DAOs can move towards a syncretic theory of organizations, meaning a theory which incorporates a wide range of cultural patterns, practices, and influences while recognizing its inherited political biases. To escape the tendency to fetishize technical protocols for governance, decentralized avatar organizations must cultivate compelling environments players want to inhabit, recognizing narratives, aesthetics, and goals held in common are key to their success. Making the internet a place not only for transactions but for relationships and thought itself, as Barlow wrote, relies on the depth of these narratives. As is the case with massively multiplayer online games, DAOs are less technical protocols for governance and more high stakes game worlds that interweave.\n\nWe should aim for rough consensus and running worlds.\n\n_This essay is the second in a [Gnosis Guild](https://twitter.com/gnosisguild?lang=de) series by [@keikreutler](https://twitter.com/keikreutler?lang=de) bridging cryptonetworks, web3, and gaming._\n\n_**Join the [Gnosis Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/wwmBWTgyEq) today to continue the conversation.**_\n\n_Cover Image: Leonora Carrington, El mundo mágico de los mayas (1964) meets CLIP.
