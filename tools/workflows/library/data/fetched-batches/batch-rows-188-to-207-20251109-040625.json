If a quorum is not reached that is a failure of the governance process in general and not of the proposal specifically. If people don’t like a proposal they should be voting against it and not just not voting. So my thinking would be that it would be acceptable for someone to repost a proposal that didn’t achieve a quorum without having to wait the 60 days. If there is agreement on this we can update the governance docs to make this clear.\nBut [@rathermercurial.eth](https://common.xyz/all-in-for-sport/account/0x3FAD8Bcd2AEa732d02a203c156B19205253F2a06) you might have a different take on this.\n\n2\n\nView upvotes\n\nShare\n\n[Anonymous  \\\\\n\\\\\nAdmin](https://common.xyz/profile/id/95002)\n\n•\n\nEdited 08/03/2023\n\nA proposal which doesn’t meet quorum is considered “invalid” according to the Voting Policy rather than “failed”. The proposal can be re-submitted, though there may be some utility in changing or clarifying this in the future since failure to meet quorum might not be a result of governance failure (we can’t predict voter behavior around undesirable proposals, especially without private voting).\n\nIf multiple proposals fail to meet quorum, there’s a mechanism to circumvent quorum requirements in order to reduce the quorum parameter by no more than 10%.\n\n2\n\nView upvotes\n\nShare\n\n[MBaldwin  \\\\\n\\\\\nModerator](https://common.xyz/profile/id/96178)\n\n•\n\nEdited 08/03/2023\n\nGM - thx for this pre-share process.
