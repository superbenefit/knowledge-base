# Discord Link Scraper Primitive - Project Plan

## üéØ Project Overview

**Type**: Primitive
**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 hours
**Target Completion**: End of Week 2

### Purpose
Document and refine the Discord link scraping primitive that automates extraction of community-shared links for knowledge base curation. This primitive enables communities to systematically harvest the collective intelligence embedded in their Discord conversations.

### Context
During SuperBenefit's knowledge base expansion, we discovered that Discord servers contain treasure troves of community-curated links - research papers, articles, tools, and resources that members naturally share during conversations. Manual extraction of these links is time-intensive, but they represent pre-filtered, community-validated content ideal for knowledge base inclusion.

## üîÑ Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Initial conversation and requirements gathering
- [x] Created simplified Discord bot script
- [x] Walked through complete setup process with user
- [x] Validated working implementation
- [x] Identified key use cases and benefits

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] Document the complete primitive
- [ ] Create setup guide with screenshots
- [ ] Add error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Include best practices for link curation

### üìã Todo
- [ ] Test script with different Discord server configurations
- [ ] Add metadata extraction options
- [ ] Create filtering and categorization features
- [ ] Document integration with AI summarization tools
- [ ] Create example workflows for knowledge base population

---

## üìù Key Artifacts to Create

### 1. Primary Documentation
**File**: `discord-link-scraper-primitive.md`

## üåü Potential Extensions

### Future Enhancements
- **Multi-platform support**: Extend to Slack, Telegram, etc.
- **Real-time monitoring**: Continuous link extraction vs batch processing
- **AI-powered filtering**: Automatic relevance scoring
- **Community feedback loops**: Integration with link rating systems
- **Cross-server aggregation**: Mining links across multiple community servers

### Integration Opportunities
- **Knowledge Graph Building**: Links as nodes in semantic networks
- **Trend Analysis**: Tracking community interest over time
- **Source Authority Mapping**: Identifying trusted link sources
- **Collaborative Curation**: Community voting on extracted links

---

## üìã Notes & Considerations

### Technical Considerations
- Discord API rate limits and best practices
- Privacy and permissions (only extracting from accessible channels)
- Data retention and storage considerations
- Error handling for deleted messages, restricted channels, etc.

### Community Considerations  
- Transparency about link extraction (community consent)
- Attribution to original sharers when appropriate
- Respect for private vs public channels
- Clear guidelines on how extracted links will be used

### Legal/Ethical Considerations
- Discord Terms of Service compliance
- Community server rules and guidelines
- Data privacy and member consent
- Fair use of extracted content

## üéØ Key Learning Questions

1. **Scalability**: How does performance change with server size and message volume?
2. **Quality**: What percentage of extracted links prove valuable for knowledge base inclusion?
3. **Community Impact**: How does systematic link mining affect community sharing behavior?
4. **Integration**: What's the most efficient workflow from extracted links to curated knowledge?
5. **Maintenance**: How often do Discord API changes require script updates?
