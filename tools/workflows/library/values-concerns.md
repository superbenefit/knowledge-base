# Values Concerns - Borderline Cases

These articles present complex values alignment questions that merit documentation for future reference and consistency.

## Borderline Cases Requiring Discussion

### Design for Secure Governance (Vitalik Buterin)
**Status**: REJECTED - Values Failure
**Concern**: While technically sophisticated, the article focuses on technical security measures without addressing social justice implications or community empowerment. Represents "governance from above" mentality that conflicts with SuperBenefit's participatory approach.
**Future Precedent**: Reject articles that treat governance as purely technical problem without considering power dynamics.

### Governance Minimization (Stefan George)
**Status**: REJECTED - Values Failure  
**Concern**: The minimization approach, while elegant technically, can enable capture by reducing community voice and oversight. Conflicts with SuperBenefit's emphasis on community participation and transparent decision-making.
**Future Precedent**: Be cautious of "hands-off" governance approaches that may reduce democratic participation.

### Diogenes DAO (Diogenes)
**Status**: REJECTED - Quality Failure
**Concern**: Philosophically interesting with some alignment to alternative economic thinking, but lacks practical implementation guidance. The "cynic DAO" approach is provocative but offers limited actionable insights.
**Future Precedent**: Require practical applicability even from philosophical/theoretical pieces.

### Trust & Coordination in DAOs (Leen/Nouns)
**Status**: REJECTED - Values Failure
**Concern**: While the research methodology appears sound, basing analysis on Nouns DAO is problematic. Nouns represents exclusive, high-barrier community (expensive NFTs) that doesn't align with SuperBenefit's accessibility values.
**Future Precedent**: Consider the values alignment of case study organizations, not just research quality.

## Values Alignment Questions for Future Reference

### When Technical Excellence Conflicts with Values
- Articles by respected technologists (like Vitalik) may have high technical quality but miss social justice considerations
- **Decision Framework**: Values alignment takes precedence over author reputation or technical sophistication

### Corporate/VC-Influenced Sources
- Many web3 resources come from corporate-backed research or VC-influenced organizations
- **Decision Framework**: Scrutinize funding sources and business models of source organizations

### Academic vs. Practical Balance
- Some academic papers provide theoretical depth but lack practical application
- **Decision Framework**: Require clear pathways from theory to implementation

### Historical/Archive Value
- Some articles capture important moments in web3 evolution but may not meet current values standards
- **Decision Framework**: Create separate archival collection if needed, but don't dilute main library

## Red Flags Identified

### Language Patterns That Signal Values Misalignment
- "Disruption" without consideration of harm
- "Scaling" without addressing externalities  
- "Efficiency" as primary value over equity
- "Innovation" without social benefit analysis
- "Governance minimization" that reduces community voice

### Source Organization Red Flags
- Organizations with extractive business models (like Hats.finance bug bounty profiteering)
- VC-backed entities promoting tokenization for its own sake
- Corporate research that serves business interests over community needs

### Perspective Red Flags
- Treating complex social issues as purely technical problems
- Ignoring power dynamics and justice implications
- False binaries that legitimize extractive approaches
- Solutions that primarily benefit already-privileged groups

## Establishment of Precedents

### Accepted Patterns
- **Commons-focused approaches**: Explicit community stewardship
- **Regenerative frameworks**: Environmental and social restoration
- **Academic rigor with practical application**: Theory that leads to action
- **Progressive community focus**: Explicitly serving social justice goals

### Rejected Patterns  
- **Technical solutionism**: Ignoring social/political dimensions
- **Corporate capture**: Research serving business over community interests
- **Extraction enablement**: Tools that primarily benefit wealth concentration
- **Elite accessibility**: High-barrier or exclusive community models

## Future Application Guidelines

1. **When in doubt about values alignment**: Err on the side of rejection
2. **Document all borderline decisions**: Build precedent database
3. **Consider source organization values**: Not just content quality
4. **Prioritize community benefit**: Over individual wealth or technical elegance
5. **Require social justice awareness**: Not just technical sophistication
