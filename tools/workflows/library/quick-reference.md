# Library Curation Quick Reference

This guide provides quick access to essential information for daily library curation work.

## Current Status

### Active Queue
- **Evaluation Queue**: See `data/final-ready-to-write.md` for approved articles ready for library entry creation
- **Discord Mining Progress**: See `data/link-analysis-progress.json` for current mining status
- **Rejection Log**: See `data/rejected-articles-log.md` for transparency documentation

### Key Metrics
- **Target Acceptance Rate**: Maximum 15% of evaluated resources
- **Priority Distribution**: 
  - ESSENTIAL (90-100): Maximum 5% of evaluated resources
  - VALUABLE (75-89): Maximum 10% of evaluated resources
- **Success Rate**: Discord mining achieves ~80% access rate, ~57% evaluation success

## Daily Workflow Checklist

### Starting a Session
- [ ] Review current queue in `data/final-ready-to-write.md`
- [ ] Check Discord mining progress in `data/link-analysis-progress.json`
- [ ] Determine session focus: evaluation, creation, or discovery

### For Resource Evaluation
- [ ] Apply triple-gate system (values, quality, uniqueness)
- [ ] Use evaluation template for systematic assessment
- [ ] Document all decisions with clear reasoning
- [ ] Update appropriate tracking files

### For Library Entry Creation
- [ ] Review link template structure
- [ ] Study existing entries for style consistency
- [ ] Ensure regenerative values emphasis
- [ ] Create meaningful SuperBenefit connections
- [ ] Save to `/links/` directory

### For Discord Mining
- [ ] Process 20-30 links per session
- [ ] Use tool hierarchy (obsidian-mcp-tools:fetch primary)
- [ ] Save progress every 5 links
- [ ] Identify library candidates for evaluation

### End of Session
- [ ] Update progress in relevant tracking files
- [ ] Document any process insights or improvements
- [ ] Commit changes with clear git messages

## Quick Decision Rules

### Immediate Rejection Triggers
- Pure profit/speculation focus without social benefit
- Extractive tokenomics or rent-seeking mechanisms
- Corporate capture narratives
- Environmental harm without mitigation
- Reinforcement of existing power structures

### Fast Track Indicators
- Clear regenerative/post-capitalist approach
- Community empowerment focus
- Novel perspective with depth
- Strong practical implementation guidance
- Recognized thought leader in regenerative space

### Values Borderline Cases
- When in doubt about values alignment: **REJECT**
- Document reasoning for future precedent
- Consult `values-concerns.md` for similar cases
- Seek team input for particularly complex decisions

## Time Management

### Session Types
- **Evaluation Session**: 2-3 resources, 20-30 minutes each
- **Creation Session**: 1-2 library entries, 45-60 minutes each
- **Discovery Session**: 20-30 Discord links, 90-120 minutes total
- **Review Session**: Process backlog, update documentation

### Efficiency Tips
- Use template prompts from workflow guides
- Batch similar evaluation types
- Document patterns for future reference
- Take breaks between intensive evaluations

## File Locations

### Active Workflows
- `readme.md` - Overview and advanced techniques
- `link-evaluation-workflow.md` - Triple-gate evaluation system
- `link-creation-workflow.md` - Entry creation process
- `discord-mining-workflow.md` - Community resource discovery

### Templates and References
- `/tools/templates/link.md` - Library entry template
- `evaluation-template.md` - Blank evaluation form
- `values-concerns.md` - Precedents for borderline cases

### Data and Tracking
- `data/final-ready-to-write.md` - Approved resources queue
- `data/link-analysis-progress.json` - Discord mining progress
- `data/rejected-articles-log.md` - Rejection documentation
- `data/superbenefit-discord-urls.csv` - Raw Discord links

## Help and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Values uncertainty**: Check precedents in `values-concerns.md`
- **Quality assessment**: Reference existing high-quality entries
- **Technical problems**: Use tool hierarchy, document failures
- **Process questions**: Consult relevant workflow guides

### Emergency Decisions
- **When overwhelmed**: Focus on ESSENTIAL tier only
- **When uncertain**: Choose rejection over inclusion
- **When stuck**: Document current state and seek team input
- **When behind**: Prioritize by strategic value scores

## Success Indicators

### Quality Metrics
- Consistent values alignment across all accepted resources
- Clear differentiation between priority tiers
- Community engagement with library entries
- Positive feedback on resource relevance

### Process Metrics
- Maintained 15% acceptance rate
- Documented reasoning for all decisions
- Regular progress on evaluation queue
- Continuous improvement in efficiency

This quick reference complements the detailed workflow guides and provides operational support for daily curation work.
