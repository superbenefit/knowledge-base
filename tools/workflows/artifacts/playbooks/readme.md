# RPP Playbook Content Creation: Human + AI Workflow

## Understanding the Content Types

Based on the RPP knowledge base, the playbook will integrate four interconnected content types that build on each other:

**Patterns** are the foundational building blocks - reusable solutions to common challenges in decentralized governance. Think of them as design principles that can be applied across different contexts. For example, the "Cell" pattern describes how small autonomous teams can operate within larger networks.

**Case Studies** provide real-world evidence of patterns in action. They document actual experiments and implementations, showing how abstract patterns play out in practice. These are created through the Experiment Documentation Framework's synthesis phase, following a structured narrative from initial discovery through implementation to outcomes and lessons learned.

**Guides** offer detailed, step-by-step implementation instructions for specific governance approaches. Unlike patterns (which are conceptual) or playbooks (which combine multiple patterns), guides provide practical "how-to" instructions for implementing particular governance structures. The attached implementation guides for community, operational, and multi-stakeholder governance exemplify this format.

**Playbooks** combine multiple patterns and reference relevant guides to create comprehensive implementation strategies. They take the conceptual frameworks of patterns, the practical evidence of case studies, and the detailed instructions of guides to create complete implementation pathways for specific use cases.

## The Foundation: Playbook Context Document

Since the content creation framework is subject-agnostic, each playbook requires a detailed context document that captures the specific strategic, audience, and implementation context. This context document serves as the foundation for all subsequent content decisions.

### Creating or Reviewing the Context Document

Before any content creation begins, ensure you have a comprehensive Playbook Context document. This can be created through a 45-minute collaborative session using the playbook context worksheet.

**Example Human Prompt to Create Context:**
> "I need to create a Playbook Context document for our DAO Cell and Community Governance Playbook. Can you provide the context gathering worksheet and guide me through capturing:
> 1. Strategic foundation (problem, theory, success vision)
> 2. Audience profile and constraints
> 3. Content strategy and tone
> 4. Implementation pathways
> Based on our RPP experiments and stakeholder feedback."

**Example Human Prompt if Context Exists:**
> "Here's our existing Playbook Context document for the DAO Cell and Community Governance Playbook [attach document]. Please review it and help me:
> 1. Identify any gaps or areas needing clarification
> 2. Ensure it aligns with insights from our recent experiments
> 3. Confirm the audience profile still matches our stakeholder needs"

The AI uses the context document as the lens through which all content decisions are made - from language choices to pattern organization to example selection.

## Leveraging the Experiment Documentation Framework

The RPP project uses a sophisticated Experiment Documentation Framework that progressively builds content through four phases. Understanding this framework is crucial because it generates much of the content needed for the playbook automatically.

### How the Framework Works

The framework transforms real-world experiments into documented knowledge through:
- **Discovery Phase**: Understanding context and challenges
- **Intervention Phase**: Designing experiments and implementation approaches
- **Reflection Phase**: Capturing learning from what actually happened
- **Synthesis Phase**: Creating comprehensive case studies

Each phase builds on the previous ones without duplication, creating a natural flow of information that culminates in polished case studies ready for the playbook.

### What This Means for Content Creation

Instead of creating content from scratch, much of your playbook content already exists within experiment documentation:
- **Case studies** are produced by the synthesis phase
- **Pattern identification** happens throughout the documentation process
- **Implementation details** for guides are captured in intervention and reflection phases
- **Stakeholder perspectives** are woven throughout all phases

## The Integrated Collaborative Workflow

### Step 1: Context-Informed Content Inventory

Using the Playbook Context document as a guide, the human reviews existing experiment documentation to understand what content aligns with the playbook's strategic foundation and audience needs.

**Example Human Prompt:**
> "Based on our Playbook Context document showing we're targeting nonprofit leaders with limited web3 experience, I need to inventory our experiment documentation. Please help me:
> 1. Identify case studies that demonstrate success with similar audiences
> 2. Find experiments that address the key problems our audience faces (bureaucracy, tech overwhelm, etc.)
> 3. Extract patterns that align with our 'minimum viable permissionless' approach
> 4. Note which experiments show clear before/after transformation relevant to social impact orgs"

The AI filters the content inventory through the context lens, prioritizing materials that match the audience profile and address their specific pain points.

### Step 2: Pattern Development Aligned with Context

The human and AI develop patterns that resonate with the specific audience and theory of change outlined in the context document.

**Example Human Prompt:**
> "Our context document emphasizes 'composability, transparency, and solidarity' as core principles. Based on our case studies showing participatory budgeting and multi-stakeholder coordination, please:
> 1. Draft patterns using Grade 9 reading level language
> 2. Avoid crypto jargon while explaining web3 concepts
> 3. Include examples from social impact contexts rather than DeFi
> 4. Show how these patterns help shift power dynamics in traditional organizations"

The AI crafts patterns that speak directly to the audience's context, using appropriate language and examples that connect to their experience.

### Step 3: Guide Extraction Addressing Specific Constraints

The human identifies guides needed based on where the target audience typically gets stuck, as documented in the context.

**Example Human Prompt:**
> "Our context shows people get stuck with:
> - Wallet safety and on-ramping
> - Getting organizational buy-in
> - Avoiding recreation of old hierarchies
> 
> Can you extract implementation insights from our experiments to create guides that:
> 1. Address these specific friction points
> 2. Acknowledge time and bureaucracy constraints
> 3. Provide 'minimum viable' starting points
> 4. Include risk mitigation for common fears"

The AI develops guides that directly address the constraints and stuck points identified in the context document.

### Step 4: Context-Driven Playbook Assembly

With the context document guiding decisions, the human outlines how to organize content for maximum impact with the target audience.

**Example Human Prompt:**
> "Given our audience includes busy nonprofit executives who need to see impact quickly, please create a playbook structure that:
> 1. Opens with compelling transformation stories from similar organizations
> 2. Provides a clear 0 → 0.5 → 1 progression pathway
> 3. Groups patterns by implementation phase rather than technical complexity
> 4. Highlights quick wins before diving into deeper governance changes
> 5. Includes decision trees for different organizational contexts (foundation vs grassroots vs co-op)"

The AI assembles the playbook following the strategic approach and success vision from the context document.

### Step 5: Supplementary Materials for Audience Success

Based on the success metrics and implementation context, the human identifies what additional support the audience needs.

**Example Human Prompt:**
> "Our context document defines success as users being able to understand AND implement these approaches. Our audience faces time constraints and complexity overwhelm. Please create:
> 1. One-page visual summaries of key patterns
> 2. Comparison charts showing web3 vs traditional approaches
> 3. ROI calculators for common use cases
> 4. 'Red flag' checklists to avoid scams
> 5. Template pitch decks for getting board buy-in"

The AI creates materials specifically designed to help the audience overcome their unique constraints and achieve the success metrics defined in the context.

### Step 6: Context Validation and Refinement

Throughout the process, the human and AI continuously validate content against the context document to ensure alignment.

**Example Human Prompt:**
> "Please review our assembled playbook content against our context document to ensure:
> 1. Language matches Grade 9 reading level throughout
> 2. Examples resonate with social impact practitioners
> 3. The progression matches how our audience actually seeks and uses guidance
> 4. Success stories demonstrate the specific transformations we envision
> 5. Tone bridges both 'social impact essence and tech essence' as specified"

## The Power of Context-Driven Creation

The Playbook Context document transforms a generic framework into a powerful tool for specific transformation. It ensures every content decision - from word choice to example selection to structural organization - serves the actual humans who will use the playbook.

This context-first approach means:
- **Patterns** are explained in language that resonates with your specific audience
- **Case studies** highlight transformations relevant to their situation
- **Guides** address their actual constraints and stuck points
- **Playbooks** follow a journey that matches how they naturally progress

## Maintaining Context Alignment

As experiments complete and new insights emerge, regularly revisit the context document:

**Quarterly Context Review Prompt:**
> "Based on feedback from playbook users and newly completed experiments, please help me:
> 1. Update our audience profile with new insights about their needs
> 2. Refine our understanding of where they get stuck
> 3. Adjust our success metrics based on actual outcomes
> 4. Identify new implementation contexts that have emerged"

This ensures the playbook remains a living document that evolves with your community's understanding and needs.

## Integration Best Practices

**Start with context**: Never begin content creation without a clear context document. If one doesn't exist, creating it is the essential first step.

**Filter everything through context**: Every content decision should reference back to the strategic foundation, audience profile, and implementation context.

**Use context as a quality check**: When reviewing content, the context document provides the criteria for evaluation.

**Update context as you learn**: The context document should evolve as experiments reveal new insights about your audience and their journey.

The result is a playbook perfectly tuned to its intended audience - using their language, addressing their specific challenges, and guiding them along a journey that makes sense for their context. This transforms a collection of patterns and case studies into a powerful tool for real transformation.
