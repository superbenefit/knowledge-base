# Pattern Update Workflow

This guide provides a structured process for enhancing and updating existing Pattern artifacts in the SuperBenefit Knowledge Base using Claude Desktop with MCP integration. Patterns, like all knowledge resources, benefit from regular maintenance and evolution as our understanding grows and new examples emerge.

## Overview

Pattern documents are not static artifacts but living resources that evolve over time. As our collective understanding develops, new implementations emerge, or related patterns are documented, existing patterns should be updated to reflect these developments. A well-maintained pattern:

- Incorporates the latest understanding and examples
- Maintains clear connections to newly documented concepts
- Provides increasingly refined implementation guidance
- Remains accurate and relevant as the field evolves

This workflow will guide you through the process of analyzing, enhancing, and updating existing patterns, leveraging Claude's capabilities to help at each step.

## Before You Begin

Before starting this workflow, ensure you have completed the environment setup described in the [Pattern Workflows README](readme.md). You should be familiar with the pattern template structure and have reviewed the existing pattern you plan to update.

## Pattern Update Workflow

### 1. Analyze the Existing Pattern

Begin by thoroughly analyzing the current pattern document:

```
"I'd like to update the '[PATTERN NAME]' pattern. Please help me analyze the current document by:

1. Retrieving the existing pattern:
   get_vault_file({
     filename: '/artifacts/patterns/[pattern-filename].md'
   })

2. Analyzing its structure and content to identify:
   - Strengths: What sections are well-developed and valuable
   - Gaps: What sections are missing or underdeveloped
   - Outdated information: What might need updating given current knowledge
   - Missing connections: Links to newer patterns or concepts that should be added
   - Examples or references: Whether these need updating or expansion
   - Structural issues: Any ways the document deviates from our current template

3. Checking when it was last updated (using file metadata) and what might have changed in our understanding since then

4. Reviewing the pattern against our quality standards from the Pattern Workflows README

Please provide a detailed assessment with specific recommendations for improvements."
```

### 2. Research Updates and New Information

Next, research any new developments or information related to the pattern:

```
"Now that we've analyzed the '[PATTERN NAME]' pattern document, let's research any new developments or information that should be incorporated. Please help me by:

   - Missing connections to newer patterns or concepts
   - Examples that might be outdated or insufficient

3. Check when it was last updated using file metadata

Now, let's research relevant developments:

1. Please use search_vault_smart to find:
   - New mentions of "DAO State" or "governance documentation" in our knowledge base
   - Recently documented patterns related to governance documentation
   - New examples of how DAOs are managing their governance state

2. Use web search to research:
   - Recent tool developments for DAO governance documentation
   - New examples of DAOs with notable governance documentation systems
   - Recent discussions about best practices in this area

Based on our analysis and research, let's prioritize enhancements:

1. Identify 3-5 key improvements that would most increase the document's value
2. For each, explain why it would enhance the document and what changes would be needed

Next, let's enhance specific high-priority sections:
1. Update the Examples section with new implementations we've discovered
2. Enhance the Implementation Considerations with current best practices
3. Update the Related Patterns section to include newly documented patterns

Let's also ensure connections to the knowledge ecosystem are current:
1. Update links to related patterns
2. Check for new primitives that support this pattern
3. Add links to any new case studies

After implementing these enhancements, let's review the updated document for:
1. Structure and formatting quality
2. Integration of new content with existing content
3. Accuracy and educational value
4. Technical precision and accessibility

Finally, we'll save the updated document to the knowledge base.
```

By following this structured workflow, you'll ensure that pattern documentation remains current, comprehensive, and valuable as our collective understanding evolves.
