# Intervention Exploration Guide

This guide helps you explore possible approaches to address the challenges and opportunities discovered. Think of it as a space for imagining "what if" rather than creating a fixed plan. Capture possibilities in whatever format helps you think creatively.

## Connecting to Discovery

*Why this matters: Grounding interventions in real challenges and genuine curiosity ensures efforts address what actually matters to people.*

Consider:
- Which challenges from Discovery feel most ready for change?
- Where did people express the most curiosity or energy?
- What patterns or leverage points emerged that suggest intervention opportunities?
- How do stakeholder interests align around certain issues?

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**
* **Priority challenges selected**: Which specific Discovery challenges you'll address
   * 
* **Stakeholder alignment**: Which groups support addressing these challenges
   * 
* **Energy indicators**: Where enthusiasm is highest
   * 
* **Baseline metrics**: Current state measurements for selected challenges
   *

â†’ **This information will be used to:**
- Track whether interventions addressed intended challenges (Reflection phase)
- Show the connection between problems and solutions (Synthesis phase)
- Demonstrate stakeholder-driven priority setting (Case study)

## Exploring Possible Approaches

*Why this matters: Having multiple pathways to consider helps organizations choose what fits their culture and capacity rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all solution.*

For each possibility, consider:
- What would this approach look like in practice?
- How might it address the identified challenges?
- What makes this exciting or concerning to different stakeholders?
- What would need to be true for this to work?

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**
* **Approach descriptions**: Concrete enough that someone could understand what you'd do
   * 
* **Pattern connections**: Which established patterns or examples inspire each approach
   * 
* **Challenge mapping**: How each approach addresses specific Discovery challenges
   * 
* **Stakeholder reactions**: Who's excited, concerned, or skeptical about each option
   * 
* **Implementation requirements**: Basic needs for each approach
   *

â†’ **This information will be used to:**
- Document what was actually tried vs. considered (Reflection phase)
- Explain strategic choices and trade-offs (Synthesis phase)
- Share alternative pathways others might try (Case study)

## Understanding Resources

*Why this matters: Being realistic about what's available - not just money but time, energy, and attention - helps design interventions that can actually happen.*

Consider exploring:
- What resources (broadly defined) are available?
- Where might resources come from that aren't obvious?
- What's the minimum needed to try something meaningful?
- How do different approaches vary in resource intensity?

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**
* **Available resources**: Specific amounts/commitments for time, money, people
   * 
* **Resource sources**: Where support will come from (internal/external)
   * 
* **Minimum viable resources**: What's needed to start vs. scale
   * 
* **Resource allocation**: How resources map to different approaches
   * 
* **Contingency planning**: What happens if resources are less than expected
   *

â†’ **This information will be used to:**
- Compare planned vs. actual resource use (Reflection phase)
- Document efficiency and sustainability (Synthesis phase)
- Help others understand true costs (Case study)

## Power and Decision-Making

*Why this matters: Many interventions shift how decisions get made and who has influence. Being explicit about these shifts helps people understand what change really means.*

Consider:
- How might different approaches change who makes decisions?
- Where would authority or influence shift?
- What would be gained and what might feel like loss?
- How do various stakeholders feel about these shifts?

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**
* **Current power map**: Who decides what now (from Discovery)
   * 
* **Proposed shifts**: How each approach would change decision-making
   * 
* **Stakeholder impacts**: Who gains/loses influence with each approach
   * 
* **Transition planning**: How power shifts would be managed
   * 
* **Resistance points**: Where pushback is likely
   *

â†’ **This information will be used to:**
- Track actual vs. planned power shifts (Reflection phase)
- Document governance transformation (Synthesis phase)
- Share lessons about managing power transitions (Case study)

## Risks and Concerns

*Why this matters: Acknowledging what could go wrong isn't pessimistic - it's realistic planning that helps build trust and prepare for challenges.*

Consider exploring:
- What keeps people up at night about trying new approaches?
- Where might resistance or friction emerge?
- What could genuinely go wrong (vs. just fear)?
- How might different risks be addressed or mitigated?

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**
* **Risk identification**: Specific risks for each approach
   * 
* **Risk assessment**: Likelihood and impact levels
   * 
* **Mitigation strategies**: How each risk could be addressed
   * 
* **Acceptable risks**: What the organization is willing to try
   * 
* **Red lines**: What would stop the experiment
   *

â†’ **This information will be used to:**
- Compare anticipated vs. actual challenges (Reflection phase)
- Show honest assessment and preparation (Synthesis phase)
- Help others anticipate similar challenges (Case study)

## Success and Evidence

*Why this matters: Being clear about what success looks like helps everyone understand what you're working toward and know if you're making progress.*

Consider:
- What would be different if interventions succeed?
- How would various stakeholders experience success?
- What evidence would show progress is happening?
- What would be worth celebrating along the way?

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**
* **Success definitions**: What "better" looks like concretely
   * 
* **Measurable indicators**: Specific metrics with current baselines
   * 
* **Qualitative indicators**: What you'll observe or hear
   * 
* **Timeline expectations**: When you expect to see changes
   * 
* **Celebration triggers**: Milestones worth acknowledging
   *

â†’ **This information will be used to:**
- Structure reflection activities (Reflection phase)
- Demonstrate impact and change (Synthesis phase)
- Define evaluation framework (Case study)

## Pathways and Choices

*Why this matters: Organizations need real choices that reflect different values, resources, and appetite for change. Creating distinct pathways helps people see trade-offs clearly.*

Consider developing different pathways like:
- A "start small" approach for testing ideas
- A "go deep" approach for transformation
- A "broad engagement" approach for inclusion
- Or whatever framings emerge from your context

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**
* **Pathway descriptions**: Clear enough for decision-making
   * 
* **Resource requirements**: What each pathway needs
   * 
* **Risk profiles**: Different risk levels and types
   * 
* **Timeline implications**: How long each might take
   * 
* **Selection criteria**: How to choose between pathways
   *

â†’ **This information will be used to:**
- Document strategic choices made (Reflection phase)
- Explain decision-making process (Synthesis phase)
- Offer options to other organizations (Case study)

## Next Steps and Experiments

*Why this matters: Moving from ideas to action requires concrete next steps that feel doable and help test assumptions before bigger commitments.*

Consider:
- What small experiments could test key assumptions?
- Which stakeholders are ready to try something now?
- What would help build confidence for bigger steps?
- How will you learn from whatever happens next?

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**
* **Immediate actions**: Who will do what by when
   * 
* **Quick wins**: What could show progress fast
   * 
* **Learning questions**: What you're testing
   * 
* **Decision points**: When you'll decide on next steps
   * 
* **Communication plan**: How you'll keep people informed
   *

â†’ **This information will be used to:**
- Track implementation progress (Reflection phase)
- Show how plans evolved into action (Synthesis phase)
- Demonstrate iterative approach (Case study)
