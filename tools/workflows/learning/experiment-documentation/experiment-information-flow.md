# Information Flow

## Overview

This document details how information moves between phases in the Experiment Documentation Framework, enabling progressive documentation that builds knowledge efficiently without duplication. Understanding these relationships helps users maximize the value of their documentation efforts while maintaining clear connections between different aspects of their engagement.

The framework provides worksheets to capture insights, templates to structure outputs, and AI synthesis prompts to help transform raw information into polished documentation. Each tool supports natural information flow between phases.

## üìä Core Information Flows

### Discovery ‚Üí Intervention Flow

The insights you gather during Discovery become the foundation for designing interventions. Understanding the organization's context, challenges, and possibilities helps you craft approaches that actually fit the situation. This isn't about following a rigid checklist - it's about ensuring your interventions are grounded in real understanding rather than assumptions.

**What Carries Forward:**
- **Organizational Profile** - Mission, structure, culture, and context insights inform intervention feasibility
- **Challenge/Opportunity Definition** - Specific problems and possibilities identified in Discovery become intervention focus areas
- **Stakeholder Analysis** - Understanding of who is involved, their perspectives, and readiness for change guides intervention design
- **System Mapping** - Current state analysis reveals intervention points and potential unintended consequences
- **Technology Readiness** - Capacity for different types of interventions influences what's possible

**How Information Transfers:**
- Intervention worksheets reference specific Discovery Report sections
- Challenge areas from Discovery become intervention opportunity categories
- Stakeholder readiness assessments inform intervention complexity decisions
- System maps reveal leverage points for intervention design
- The Intervention template prompts you to connect back to Discovery findings

**Questions to Consider:**
- Do we understand enough about the organization to explore interventions?
- Which Discovery insights feel most important for shaping our approach?
- What additional understanding might help us design better interventions?

### Intervention ‚Üí Reflection Flow

When you move from planning to doing, new learning emerges constantly. The Reflection phase captures this learning by comparing what you expected to happen with what actually unfolded. Your intervention plans provide the baseline for reflection - they remind you what you were trying to achieve and help you notice both successes and surprises.

**What Carries Forward:**
- **Intervention Plans** - What was attempted, why, and what was expected
- **Success Metrics** - How intervention effectiveness was defined and measured
- **Implementation Approach** - Methods, timeline, and resource allocation used
- **Stakeholder Roles** - Who was involved in implementation and how
- **Risk Assessments** - Anticipated challenges and mitigation strategies

**How Information Transfers:**
- Reflection worksheets begin with intervention plan review
- Success metrics become reflection evaluation criteria
- Stakeholder roles inform who should be involved in reflection activities
- Risk assessments guide what to look for in outcome analysis
- Templates include prompts to reference original plans and expectations

**Questions to Consider:**
- Have we tried enough to have meaningful reflections?
- How do we capture learning while still in motion?
- What depth of reflection serves our current needs?

### Reflection ‚Üí Synthesis Flow

Multiple cycles of reflection build into rich understanding that's worth sharing. The Synthesis phase weaves together all your learning - from initial discovery through various interventions and reflections - into a coherent story. This isn't just about reporting what happened; it's about extracting insights that can help others facing similar challenges.

**What Carries Forward:**
- **Outcome Documentation** - What actually happened versus what was expected
- **Lessons Learned** - Insights about what worked, what didn't, and why
- **Stakeholder Feedback** - Multiple perspectives on intervention effectiveness and experience
- **Unintended Consequences** - Unexpected outcomes both positive and negative
- **Process Insights** - Learning about facilitation, engagement, and collaboration approaches

**How Information Transfers:**
- Synthesis worksheets compile insights from all reflection cycles
- Outcome patterns become case study narrative elements
- Stakeholder quotes provide multiple perspective evidence
- Process insights inform methodology recommendations
- The Case Study template weaves all phases into a coherent story

**Final Output:** A comprehensive Case Study that tells your transformation story

**Questions to Consider:**
- Do we have enough reflection material for meaningful synthesis?
- Which insights would be most valuable to share with others?
- How do we balance comprehensive documentation with readability?

### Cross-Phase Connections

Information doesn't just flow forward - it also creates valuable feedback loops and direct connections between non-adjacent phases. These connections deepen understanding and enable more nuanced documentation.

**Discovery ‚Üí Reflection (Direct)**
- Original challenges provide baseline for measuring change
- Stakeholder expectations become evaluation criteria
- System understanding reveals where to look for impacts

**Intervention ‚Üí Discovery (Feedback)**
- Implementation reveals new organizational understanding
- Challenges uncover unknown constraints
- Engagement deepens contextual knowledge

**Reflection ‚Üí Intervention (Iterative)**
- Learning informs intervention refinement
- Outcomes guide approach modifications
- Feedback shapes new possibilities

## üîÑ Working with Natural Patterns

**Remember:** The framework adapts to your natural process. You don't need to follow a rigid sequence - start where you are and let the work guide you.

### Common Flow Patterns

Every engagement has its own rhythm. While the framework presents phases in a logical sequence, real-world work rarely follows a straight line. Understanding different flow patterns helps you recognize your own journey and work with its natural shape rather than forcing it into a predetermined path.

**Linear Flow (Traditional)**
```
Discovery ‚Üí Intervention ‚Üí Reflection ‚Üí Synthesis
```
Works well for: Structured engagements with clear phases

**Iterative Flow (Agile)**
```
Discovery ‚Üî Intervention ‚Üî Reflection
                     ‚Üì
                 Synthesis
```
Works well for: Experimental approaches with multiple cycles

**Parallel Flow (Complex)**
```
Discovery ‚Üí Reflection
    ‚Üì           ‚Üì
Intervention ‚Üí Synthesis
```
Works well for: Multi-track engagements

**Continuous Flow (Ongoing)**
```
Discovery ‚Üí Intervention ‚Üí Reflection ‚Üí Synthesis
    ‚Üë           ‚Üë              ‚Üë           ‚Üì
    ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
```
Works well for: Long-term partnerships

### Managing Overlapping Phases

In practice, phases often blur and blend. You might discover crucial insights while implementing interventions, or find that reflection reveals gaps in your original discovery. This overlap is natural and valuable - it deepens understanding and creates richer documentation.

**Discovery and Intervention Overlap**
- Emergent opportunities arise during discovery
- Quick tests deepen understanding
- Maintain separate documentation while noting connections

**Continuous Reflection**
- Capture learning at any point
- Date-stamp entries to track evolution
- Build cumulative understanding over time

## üìç Navigating Phase Transitions

Knowing when to move between phases is more art than science. Rather than following rigid timelines or checklists, pay attention to natural indicators that suggest you're ready to shift focus. These transitions often overlap - you might begin reflection while still implementing interventions, or discover new insights that reshape your approach mid-stream.

### Moving from Discovery to Intervention

You'll know you're ready to explore interventions when the organization's story starts to make sense - when you can see not just what's happening, but why it's happening and where change might be possible. This doesn't mean you know everything; it means you know enough to begin imagining thoughtful approaches.

**Signs You Might Be Ready:**
- You have a solid grasp of organizational context and culture
- Key stakeholders are identified and their perspectives understood
- Primary challenges and opportunities are clearly articulated
- You can see potential intervention points in the system
- Technology and resource capacity has been assessed

**Questions to Explore:**
- Can we explain the situation clearly to others?
- Do we understand different stakeholder perspectives?
- Can we imagine how interventions might play out?
- Do we have enough context to design meaningful approaches?

### Moving from Intervention to Reflection

Reflection becomes valuable when there's enough happening to learn from. This might be after a significant milestone, when something surprising occurs, or simply when you sense that pausing to capture insights would help the work move forward more effectively.

**Signs You Might Be Ready:**
- You've documented intervention plans with hoped-for outcomes
- Enough activity has happened to generate learnings
- Stakeholders have experiences to share
- You can see both intended and unintended outcomes emerging
- There's value in pausing to capture insights

**Questions to Explore:**
- Is there enough happening to reflect on meaningfully?
- Are different perspectives available to include?
- Can we start to see what's working and what isn't?
- Would capturing learning now help us adapt?

### Moving from Reflection to Synthesis

The urge to synthesize often emerges when patterns become clear - when individual reflections start revealing broader truths about transformation. You'll feel ready to tell the larger story when you have both depth and breadth of experience to share.

**Signs You Might Be Ready:**
- Multiple reflection cycles have built rich understanding
- Patterns are emerging across different experiences
- Stakeholder feedback reveals consistent themes
- You have both successes and struggles to share
- The story of transformation is becoming clear

**Questions to Explore:**
- Do we have enough depth for meaningful synthesis?
- Can we see patterns others could learn from?
- Are multiple perspectives represented in our reflections?
- Is there a compelling story to tell?
