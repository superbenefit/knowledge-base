# Synthesis Phase

## Purpose
The Synthesis phase weaves documentation from all previous phases into a compelling story of transformation. It creates a case study that serves multiple audiences - from funders who need evidence of impact to practitioners seeking guidance for similar work. This is where experiential learning becomes collective wisdom.

## Information Flow

### What You Pull from All Phases
**From Discovery:**
- Organizational starting point and context
- Original challenges that sparked the work
- Stakeholder landscape and initial energy
- The "before" picture that makes change visible

**From Intervention:**
- Strategic choices and why you made them
- Different pathways you considered
- Resources invested and approaches taken
- The rationale behind your experiments

**From Reflection:**
- What actually unfolded versus plans
- Evidence of change and transformation
- Multiple perspectives on the experience
- Honest assessment of what worked and didn't

### What You Create Here
- **Narrative arc** - The story of transformation from beginning to current state
- **Evidence of impact** - Both quantitative and qualitative demonstrations of change
- **Multiple perspectives** - How different stakeholders experienced the journey
- **Transferable insights** - Patterns and learning others can adapt
- **Honest complexity** - Acknowledging messiness while showing progress
- **Future possibilities** - Where the work might go next

### How It's Used
- **Funder requirements** → Demonstrates impact and wise use of resources
- **Practitioner guidance** → Provides roadmap for similar efforts
- **Organizational memory** → Captures institutional learning
- **Knowledge commons** → Contributes to collective understanding
- **Future experiments** → Informs what to try next

### What You Produce
**Case Study** - A rich narrative that brings together all phases into a coherent story. It balances comprehensive documentation with engaging storytelling, serving both accountability needs and learning purposes.

## Process Overview
1. **Gather all documentation** - Assemble reports from each phase
2. **Find the story threads** - Identify what connects across phases
3. **Honor multiple voices** - Weave in different perspectives
4. **Extract transferable wisdom** - Pull out insights others can use
5. **Create compelling narrative** - Make it worth reading

## Getting Started
Begin by spreading out all your documentation - Discovery Report, Intervention Map, and all Reflection documents. Look for the story that wants to be told. The worksheet helps you identify the most important threads. The workflow guides you in weaving them together into something that serves everyone who invested in this work while contributing to broader learning.
