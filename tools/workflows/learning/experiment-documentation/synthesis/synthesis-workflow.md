# Synthesis Documentation Workflow

This workflow guides you through using the Synthesis phase documents to create a comprehensive case study.

## Understanding the Value

The case study integrates documentation from all previous phases into a coherent narrative that demonstrates transformation and contributes to collective knowledge. It serves multiple audiences - funders, practitioners, communities, and researchers - while maintaining the authentic journey. This workflow shows how to systematically synthesize multi-phase documentation using the framework tools.

## Document Sequence

1. **Review readme.md** → Understand synthesis documentation purpose
2. **Gather all phase documents** → Compile Discovery, Intervention, and Reflection materials
3. **Use synthesis-worksheet.md** → Extract and organize key elements
4. **Apply synthesis-template.md** → Structure the case study
5. **AI-assisted synthesis** → Create integrated narrative
6. **Quality review** → Ensure multi-stakeholder value

## Step 1: Review Requirements

Start by reading the Synthesis phase readme.md to understand:
- How synthesis integrates all phases
- What makes compelling case studies
- Multiple audience needs
- Pattern documentation requirements

## Step 2: Document Assembly

Gather all documentation:
- Discovery Report
- Intervention Map
- All Reflection documents
- Any supplementary materials
- Stakeholder feedback

Review these with fresh eyes, looking for the complete story arc.

## Step 3: Pattern Extraction with Worksheet

Use synthesis-worksheet.md to systematically extract key elements:
- Identify the narrative arc
- Find connecting threads across phases
- Note multiple stakeholder stories
- Document evidence of change
- Capture complexity honestly
- Extract transferable insights

Work through all worksheet sections to ensure comprehensive synthesis.

## Step 4: AI-Assisted Narrative Development

Transform worksheet content into case study sections:

### Executive Summary
```
Create a 300-400 word executive summary for this case study:

Key highlights: [paste from worksheet section 1]
Major transformations: [paste from worksheet section 4]
Primary insights: [paste from worksheet section 6]
Stakeholder impacts: [paste from worksheet section 3]

Open with the most significant transformation, briefly contextualize, highlight approach and outcomes, note knowledge contributions. Write for multiple audiences.
```

### Background and Context
```
Develop the background section:

Organizational context: [paste from Discovery summary]
Initial challenges: [paste from worksheet section 1]
Why change needed: [paste catalyst information]

Create engaging narrative (800 words) that sets up the story without repeating full Discovery report.
```

### Transformation Story
```
Create the transformation story section:

Narrative arc: [paste from worksheet section 1]
Key milestones: [paste from timeline]
Multiple perspectives: [paste from worksheet section 3]
Challenges and pivots: [paste from worksheet section 5]

Develop narrative (1500 words) that brings the complete transformation experience to life with specific examples and stakeholder voices.
```

### Approach and Methodology
```
Document the strategic approach:

Interventions chosen: [paste from Intervention Map summary]
Why these approaches: [paste rationale]
Adaptations made: [paste from reflections]
Resources used: [paste from worksheet section 7]

Explain (600 words) how Discovery led to specific interventions and how they evolved.
```

### Outcomes and Impact
```
Synthesize transformation evidence:

Changes documented: [paste from worksheet section 4]
Quantitative outcomes: [paste metrics]
Qualitative shifts: [paste stories]
Stakeholder benefits: [paste impacts]

Present (1000 words) balanced view of what changed, supported by evidence from reflections.
```

### Key Learnings
```
Extract transferable insights:

Insights identified: [paste from worksheet section 6]
Patterns validated: [paste what worked]
Challenges navigated: [paste from worksheet section 5]
Questions remaining: [paste from worksheet section 8]

Develop (800 words) insights others can adapt, not prescriptions to follow.
```

### Pattern Documentation
```
Document patterns for knowledge commons:

Patterns used: [list from interventions]
How implemented: [paste adaptations]
Performance assessment: [paste from reflections]
New patterns discovered: [paste innovations]

Create clear pattern documentation for others to reference and build upon.
```

## Step 5: Template Population

With synthesized content:
1. Open synthesis-template.md
2. Follow the narrative structure
3. Paste and integrate content
4. Add transitions between sections
5. Include visuals where helpful
6. Ensure story coherence

## Step 6: Quality Review

Enhance your case study with these prompts:

### Narrative Coherence
```
Review this case study for story quality:

[Paste document]

Assess:
- Complete story arc from challenge to transformation
- Natural flow between sections
- Balance of detail and readability
- Evidence supporting claims

Suggest improvements for narrative power.
```

### Multi-Stakeholder Value
```
Review for different audience needs:

[Paste document]

Check whether:
- Funders: Impact and transformation clear
- Communities: Authentic voices prominent
- Practitioners: Practical guidance included
- Researchers: Methodology and evidence rigorous

Suggest enhancements for each audience.
```

### Pattern Quality
```
Review pattern documentation:

[Paste pattern sections]

Verify:
- Clear pattern descriptions
- Implementation details included
- Honest performance assessment
- Practical adaptation guidance
- New discoveries highlighted

Enhance for knowledge commons contribution.
```

### Visual Enhancement
```
Identify opportunities for visual communication:

[Paste document sections]

Suggest where to add:
- Transformation diagrams
- Phase timelines
- Stakeholder impact maps
- Pattern relationship visuals

Provide specific visual recommendations.
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Information overload
**Solution**: Focus on most significant elements; move details to appendices

**Issue**: Conflicting narratives
**Solution**: Acknowledge different perspectives as part of rich story

**Issue**: Weak evidence
**Solution**: Return to reflection documents for specific examples

**Issue**: Single perspective dominance
**Solution**: Actively integrate quotes and stories from multiple stakeholders

## Deliverable: Case Study

Your completed case study should:
- Tell compelling transformation story
- Serve multiple stakeholder needs
- Include honest complexity
- Extract transferable insights
- Document patterns clearly
- Inspire and inform others

The document typically runs 10-15 pages (4000-6000 words) with visuals, creating accessible yet substantive contribution to collective learning.
