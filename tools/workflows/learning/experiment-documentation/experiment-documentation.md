# Experiment Documentation Framework

A progressive approach to capturing wisdom from organizational experiments and collaborative change efforts. This framework transforms lived experience into shareable knowledge without creating documentation burden.

## What This Framework Offers

When you're running experiments in organizational change, facilitating collaborative transformation, or exploring new ways of working together, valuable insights emerge constantly. Too often, these insights get lost in the rush of doing the work. This framework provides a gentle structure for capturing learning as it happens, building understanding progressively, and creating documentation that serves multiple purposes.

The framework respects that real change work is messy, non-linear, and full of surprises. Rather than forcing rigid documentation requirements, it offers flexible tools that adapt to how your work actually unfolds. Whether you're exploring new governance models, experimenting with collaborative practices, or facilitating community transformation, this framework helps ensure the wisdom gained isn't lost.

## Core Value: Progressive Documentation

Traditional documentation often asks for the same information multiple times in different formats, creating burden without value. This framework uses **progressive documentation** - a philosophy where:

- **Knowledge builds naturally** - Each phase's insights flow into the next without repetition
- **Information is captured once** - At its natural point of emergence, then referenced wherever needed
- **Understanding deepens over time** - Like a good conversation that builds rather than starting over
- **Multiple voices are woven together** - Resisting single-story dominance and amplifying diverse perspectives
- **Documentation serves the work** - Not the other way around

## Understanding the Phases

The framework offers four interconnected phases. While presented in a logical sequence, real work rarely follows straight lines. Start wherever makes sense for your current situation.

### [[discovery/discovery|Discovery]] - Understanding Context
*Where are we starting from?*

Discovery helps you understand the organizational landscape - not just structures and processes, but the human dynamics, challenges, and possibilities that make each situation unique. This phase creates the foundation for everything that follows.

**You'll explore:** Current challenges, stakeholder perspectives, systemic patterns, areas of curiosity, readiness for change

**You'll create:** A Discovery Report that tells the organization's story in a way that feels true to those living it

### [[intervention/intervention|Intervention]] - Exploring Possibilities  
*What might we try?*

Intervention transforms Discovery insights into strategic possibilities. Rather than prescribing solutions, this phase maps multiple pathways forward, helping organizations see their options and make informed choices.

**You'll explore:** Different approaches to challenges, resource requirements, potential risks, success indicators, power dynamics

**You'll create:** An Intervention Map showing genuine alternatives with clear trade-offs

### [[reflection/reflection|Reflection]] - Capturing Learning
*What are we discovering?*

Reflection happens throughout your work - after key events, when surprises occur, or at natural pause points. This phase captures learning while it's fresh, building wisdom from experience.

**You'll explore:** What actually happened, unexpected outcomes, multiple perspectives, emotional dimensions, emerging patterns

**You'll create:** Reflection Documents that honestly capture learning as it emerges

### [[synthesis/synthesis|Synthesis]] - Sharing Wisdom
*What does it all mean?*

Synthesis weaves together insights from all phases into a coherent story of transformation. This creates documentation that serves both immediate stakeholders and contributes to collective wisdom.

**You'll explore:** Narrative threads across phases, evidence of change, transferable insights, honest complexity

**You'll create:** A Case Study that tells your transformation story in ways others can learn from

## Available Resources

Each phase provides four types of resources designed to work together:

### ðŸ“‹ Worksheets
Thinking tools with questions to explore during your work. Use these as conversation guides, reflection prompts, or personal exploration tools. They're designed to surface important insights without feeling like forms to fill out.

### ðŸ“„ Templates  
Document structures for organizing your insights. These provide professional frameworks while leaving room for your unique story. They ensure you capture what matters without constraining how you express it.

### ðŸ”„ Workflows
Step-by-step guides for transforming raw insights into polished documentation. Includes AI synthesis prompts that help you work efficiently while maintaining authentic voice.

### ðŸ“š Phase Guides
Each phase has its own overview explaining principles, common patterns, and what makes for quality documentation in that phase.

## Getting Started

### First Steps
1. **Orient yourself** - Read the [[readme|main README]] to understand the framework's philosophy
2. **Start where you are** - Choose the phase that matches your current work
3. **Explore the tools** - Each phase's README explains available resources
4. **Begin capturing** - Use worksheets to guide initial exploration

### Choosing Your Path

**If you're just beginning to understand a situation:**
Start with [[discovery/discovery|Discovery]] to build foundational understanding

**If you're in the middle of trying something new:**
Jump to [[reflection/reflection|Reflection]] to capture emerging insights

**If you're designing interventions:**
Use [[intervention/intervention|Intervention]] to map possibilities

**If you're ready to share your story:**
Move to [[synthesis/synthesis|Synthesis]] to create your case study

### Working Principles

- **Use what serves you** - Adapt everything to your context
- **Capture naturally** - Notes, recordings, drawings - whatever helps you think
- **Build incrementally** - Small additions create the bigger picture
- **Trust emergence** - Let understanding develop rather than forcing it
- **Share your learning** - Your experiments help others facing similar challenges

## Information Flow

The framework is designed so insights naturally build across phases. Discovery findings inform intervention design. Intervention plans provide context for reflection. Reflections accumulate into synthesis. This flow eliminates redundancy while building comprehensive understanding.

## Remember

This framework succeeds when it serves your work, not when you serve the framework. Take what's useful, adapt what needs adapting, and trust that meaningful documentation emerges from genuine engagement with the work itself.

Your experiments in organizational change and collaborative transformation generate valuable wisdom. This framework simply helps ensure that wisdom is captured, organized, and shared in ways that serve both immediate needs and collective learning.
