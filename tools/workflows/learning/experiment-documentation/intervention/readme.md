# Intervention Phase

## Purpose
The Intervention phase transforms Discovery insights into strategic possibilities. It creates documentation that shows multiple pathways forward, helping organizations understand their options and make informed choices about where to invest energy and resources.

## Information Flow

### What You Use from Discovery
- **Identified challenges** → Become the focus for intervention design
- **Stakeholder analysis** → Informs engagement strategies and participation
- **Organizational context** → Shapes what's realistic and feasible
- **Areas of interest** → Guide which possibilities to explore deeply
- **Readiness factors** → Help calibrate intervention scope and pace

### What You Create Here
- **Multiple pathways** - Different approaches to address challenges
- **Resource requirements** - What each pathway needs to succeed
- **Risk considerations** - What could go wrong and how to prepare
- **Success indicators** - How you'll know if interventions are working
- **Power dynamics** - How interventions might shift relationships

### How It's Used Later
- **Chosen pathways** → Guide actual implementation activities
- **Success criteria** → Become benchmarks for reflection
- **Resource plans** → Inform project management and logistics
- **Risk assessments** → Prepare teams for likely challenges
- **Stakeholder strategies** → Shape engagement approaches

### What You Produce
**Intervention Map** - A strategic document presenting genuine choices about how to proceed. It shows trade-offs, requirements, and possibilities in ways that support good decision-making without prescribing a single path.

## Process Overview
1. **Ground in Discovery findings** - Review what you learned about context
2. **Explore possibilities** - Use the worksheet to map different approaches
3. **Develop strategic options** - Create genuine alternatives with clear trade-offs
4. **Make choices visible** - Document in ways that support decision-making

## Available Tools
- `intervention.md` - Overview and principles for intervention documentation
- `intervention-worksheet.md` - Framework for exploring possibilities
- `intervention-template.md` - Structure for your Intervention Map
- `intervention-workflow.md` - AI prompts for strategic synthesis

## Getting Started
Begin by reviewing your Discovery Report - let those insights guide your exploration. The worksheet helps you think through multiple approaches systematically. Don't just document the obvious path; explore genuine alternatives. The workflow helps transform your strategic thinking into clear documentation that enables good decisions.
