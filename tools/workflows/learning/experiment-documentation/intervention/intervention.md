# Intervention Documentation

Exploring possible approaches and mapping how they might address the challenges discovered.

## What Makes Good Intervention Documentation

Strong intervention documentation bridges the gap between understanding problems and taking action. It transforms Discovery insights into strategic possibilities without being prescriptive. The best Intervention Maps help organizations see multiple pathways forward, understand the resources and risks involved, and feel confident about taking next steps. They balance ambitious vision with practical reality, serving as both inspiration and practical guide.

## Common Patterns in Effective Interventions

The most useful Intervention Maps acknowledge that change is complex and non-linear. They present options rather than prescriptions, helping organizations choose paths that match their culture and capacity. They're honest about resources required - not just money, but time, energy, and emotional investment. They consider both technical and human elements, recognizing that the best system design fails without buy-in and understanding.

Effective intervention documentation connects each possibility back to specific challenges identified in Discovery, showing clear line-of-sight between problems and potential solutions. It considers multiple stakeholder perspectives and maintains hope while being realistic - showing that meaningful change is possible without minimizing the effort required.

## Key Principles

- **Present real choices** - Show multiple pathways with genuine trade-offs
- **Connect to Discovery** - Every intervention should address identified challenges
- **Be resource realistic** - Honest assessment of what's required
- **Consider all stakeholders** - What works for some might challenge others
