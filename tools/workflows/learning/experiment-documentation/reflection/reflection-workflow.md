# Reflection Documentation Workflow

This workflow guides you through using the Reflection phase documents to create comprehensive learning documentation.

## Understanding the Value

Reflection documentation captures learning from implementation activities, creating records that inform adaptation and contribute to final synthesis. Unlike one-time reports, reflection can occur multiple times throughout an experiment, building cumulative understanding. This workflow shows how to systematically document learning using the framework tools.

## Document Sequence

1. **Review readme.md** → Understand reflection documentation purpose
2. **Reference earlier phases** → Connect to original plans and expectations
3. **Use reflection-worksheet.md** → Capture insights systematically
4. **Apply reflection-template.md** → Structure learning documentation
5. **AI-assisted synthesis** → Transform observations into insights
6. **Quality review** → Ensure learning value

## Step 1: Review Requirements

Start by reading the Reflection phase readme.md to understand:
- How reflection connects to earlier phases
- What makes valuable learning documentation
- Different types of reflection (periodic, milestone, final)
- How reflections inform synthesis

## Step 2: Reference Context

Before using the worksheet, review:
- Original challenges from Discovery Report
- Chosen interventions and success criteria
- Implementation plans and timelines
- Previous reflections (if any)

## Step 3: Learning Capture with Worksheet

Use reflection-worksheet.md to systematically capture insights:
- Document what actually happened
- Note surprises and unexpected outcomes
- Capture multiple stakeholder perspectives
- Identify emerging patterns
- Track emotional dimensions

The worksheet can be used multiple times - for quick captures or comprehensive reviews.

## Step 4: AI-Assisted Synthesis

Transform worksheet content into structured documentation:

### Executive Summary
```
Create an executive summary for this reflection:

Period covered: [specify timeframe or activities]
Key events: [paste from worksheet section 1]
Major learnings: [paste from worksheet section 3]
Implications: [paste from worksheet section 8]

Write 2-3 paragraphs highlighting most significant insights and their importance.
```

### What Happened
```
Document the implementation experience:

Activities undertaken: [paste from worksheet section 1]
Planned vs actual: [reference intervention plans]
Key moments: [paste significant events]

Create narrative showing what actually occurred without interpretation.
```

### Surprises and Discoveries
```
Synthesize unexpected elements:

Surprises noted: [paste from worksheet section 2]
Why unexpected: [add context from plans]

Present discoveries that challenged assumptions or revealed new understanding.
```

### Learning Analysis
```
Transform learning observations into insights:

Patterns observed: [paste from worksheet section 3]
Different perspectives: [paste from worksheet section 4]
Questions emerging: [paste from worksheet section 7]

Develop clear learning statements with supporting evidence.
```

### Stakeholder Experiences
```
Create multi-perspective documentation:

Stakeholder feedback: [paste from worksheet section 4]
Emotional observations: [paste from worksheet section 5]

Show how different groups experienced the same activities.
```

### Shifts and Changes
```
Document evolution and progress:

Changes noted: [paste from worksheet section 6]
Progress indicators: [reference success criteria]

Present evidence of transformation or movement.
```

### Implications
```
Connect learning to future action:

Implications identified: [paste from worksheet section 8]
Adjustments needed: [based on learnings]

Show how insights should influence next steps.
```

## Step 5: Template Population

For each reflection document:
1. Open reflection-template.md
2. Note the reflection type and period
3. Paste synthesized content
4. Connect to implementation context
5. Maintain learning focus

## Step 6: Quality Review

Strengthen reflection documentation with these prompts:

### Learning Value Check
```
Review this reflection for learning quality:

[Paste document]

Assess whether:
- Insights go beyond surface observations
- Learning is supported by evidence
- Multiple perspectives are included
- Implications for future action are clear

Suggest enhancements for deeper learning value.
```

### Authenticity Review
```
Check this reflection for honest assessment:

[Paste document]

Verify:
- Both successes and challenges included
- Surprises and failures acknowledged
- Real examples support claims
- Appropriate vulnerability maintained

Identify areas needing more authentic treatment.
```

### Connection Validation
```
Review connections to earlier phases:

[Paste document]

Check whether:
- References to original plans are clear
- Progress against success criteria shown
- Evolution from previous reflections tracked
- Learning builds on earlier insights

Suggest improvements for better phase integration.
```

## Managing Multiple Reflections

When creating multiple reflection documents:

### Progressive Building
```
Synthesize evolution across reflections:

Reflection 1: [paste key insights]
Reflection 2: [paste key insights]
Reflection 3: [paste key insights]

Show how understanding developed over time and what patterns persisted.
```

### Pattern Identification
```
Identify recurring themes across reflections:

[Paste insights from multiple reflections]

Find patterns that appear consistently and what they reveal about the change process.
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Too close to see patterns
**Solution**: Use AI to identify themes across observations

**Issue**: Only positive outcomes shared
**Solution**: Specifically prompt for challenges and failures

**Issue**: Missing stakeholder voices
**Solution**: Note gaps; gather additional perspectives if possible

**Issue**: Vague learning statements
**Solution**: Connect each insight to specific evidence

## Deliverable: Reflection Documents

Your reflection documentation should:
- Capture authentic learning from experience
- Include multiple perspectives
- Connect to original intentions
- Identify patterns and insights
- Inform future action

Length varies by reflection type - from 2-3 page periodic reflections to 8-10 page comprehensive retrospectives.
