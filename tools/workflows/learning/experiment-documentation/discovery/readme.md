# Discovery Phase

## Purpose
The Discovery phase helps you understand organizational context, challenges, and possibilities. It creates foundational documentation that informs everything that follows, ensuring your experiments are grounded in real understanding rather than assumptions.

## Information Flow

### What You Gather Here
- **Organizational context** - How things actually work, not just the org chart
- **Current challenges** - What's frustrating people and blocking progress
- **Stakeholder perspectives** - Who's involved and what matters to them
- **Areas of curiosity** - What people wonder about and want to explore
- **Readiness indicators** - Energy, resources, and appetite for change

### How It's Used Later
- **Challenges identified** → Become focus areas for interventions
- **Stakeholder mapping** → Guides who to involve in what ways
- **Organizational context** → Shapes what interventions are feasible
- **Interest areas** → Inform which pathways to explore
- **Readiness assessment** → Helps calibrate intervention ambition

### What You Create
**Discovery Report** - A comprehensive yet accessible document that captures the organization's current state and possibilities. This becomes your reference point throughout the experiment, helping everyone stay grounded in shared understanding.

## Process Overview
1. **Explore with the worksheet** - Use it to guide conversations and capture insights
2. **Let understanding emerge** - Information flows naturally into thematic areas
3. **Synthesize with AI assistance** - Transform notes into coherent sections
4. **Create accessible documentation** - Ensure multiple audiences can understand

## Available Tools
- `discovery.md` - Overview and principles for good discovery documentation
- `discovery-worksheet.md` - Questions to explore during conversations
- `discovery-template.md` - Structure for your Discovery Report
- `discovery-workflow.md` - AI prompts and synthesis guidance

## Getting Started
Begin with the worksheet - it's designed as a thinking tool, not a form to complete. Have conversations, make observations, gather perspectives. The questions help ensure you're exploring important areas, but follow the energy and curiosity you encounter. When you have substantial insights, the workflow guides you in creating documentation that serves everyone involved.
