# Discovery Exploration Guide

This guide helps you gather insights about organizational context, challenges, and curiosities. Use it as a conversation starter, not a form to fill out. Capture information in whatever way feels natural - notes, recordings, drawings, or any format that helps you think.

## Organizational Context

*Why this matters: Understanding the organization's story and current reality helps ground all future exploration in what's actually happening rather than what we imagine.*

Consider exploring:
- What's the organization's origin story and how has it evolved?
- What does the organization care most deeply about?
- How do people describe the culture here?
- What external forces are shaping the organization right now?

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**
* **Basic facts**: Legal structure, size (staff/budget/reach), geographic scope
   * 
* **Mission and values**: Both formal statements and lived reality
   * 
* **Cultural characteristics**: How work gets done, communication style, change history
   * 
* **External context**: Regulatory environment, market forces, community dynamics
   *

â†’ **This information will be used to:**
- Design interventions that fit organizational capacity (Intervention phase)
- Measure cultural shifts and capability changes (Reflection phase)
- Provide the "before" picture in your case study (Synthesis phase)

## How Things Actually Work

*Why this matters: The official structure rarely tells the whole story. Understanding how decisions really get made and work actually flows reveals opportunities for meaningful change.*

Consider exploring:
- How do decisions actually get made here (not how they're supposed to)?
- Where does information get stuck or flow freely?
- Which relationships and connections matter most?
- What are the unwritten rules everyone knows?

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**
* **Decision-making patterns**: Who's involved, typical timelines, where bottlenecks occur
   * 
* **Core processes**: Map 2-3 key processes with steps, stakeholders, and pain points
   * 
* **Information flows**: Where knowledge lives, how it's shared (or not)
   * 
* **Power dynamics**: Who has formal vs. informal influence
   *

â†’ **This information will be used to:**
- Identify intervention points in existing processes (Intervention phase)
- Track shifts in decision-making and information flow (Reflection phase)
- Document system transformation in your case study (Synthesis phase)

## Current Challenges

*Why this matters: Identifying patterns in what's not working helps focus energy where change could make the biggest difference. Look for systemic issues, not just surface problems.*

Consider exploring:
- What keeps coming up in conversations as frustrating or broken?
- Where do people feel stuck or powerless?
- What would people fix first if they had a magic wand?
- How do these challenges connect to each other?

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**
* **Specific challenges**: Concrete examples, not just general frustrations
   * 
* **Impact data**: Who's affected, how often, what it costs (time/money/morale)
   * 
* **Root causes**: Why these problems persist, systemic factors
   * 
* **Current responses**: What's been tried, why it hasn't worked
   * 
* **Priority ranking**: Which challenges people most want to address
   *

â†’ **This information will be used to:**
- Select focus areas for intervention design (Intervention phase)
- Create baseline metrics for measuring change (Reflection phase)
- Show the problems your experiment addressed (Synthesis phase)

## Stakeholder Perspectives

*Why this matters: Different people experience the organization differently. Understanding multiple viewpoints reveals the full picture and helps ensure changes work for everyone.*

Consider exploring:
- Who's affected by how things currently work?
- What matters most to different groups?
- Where do perspectives align or clash?
- Who has influence (formal or informal) over change?

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**
* **Stakeholder mapping**: Groups, roles, relationships between them
   * 
* **Influence levels**: High/medium/low ability to drive or block change
   * 
* **Current satisfaction**: What's working well vs. frustrations for each group
   * 
* **Interests and needs**: What each group values most
   * 
* **Change readiness**: Enthusiasm, skepticism, or resistance indicators
   *

â†’ **This information will be used to:**
- Design inclusive intervention approaches (Intervention phase)
- Track different stakeholder experiences (Reflection phase)
- Include multiple perspectives in your story (Synthesis phase)

## Curiosities and Possibilities

*Why this matters: The most powerful changes often come from following genuine curiosity rather than prescribed solutions. What people wonder about reveals where energy for exploration exists.*

Consider exploring:
- What are people genuinely curious about trying?
- What "what if" questions keep coming up?
- Where do people see potential they're excited about?
- What examples from elsewhere spark interest?

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**
* **Specific interests**: Named approaches or patterns people want to explore
   * 
* **Energy levels**: Which possibilities generate most enthusiasm
   * 
* **Success visions**: What "better" looks like to different people
   * 
* **Inspiration sources**: Examples or models people reference
   * 
* **Learning desires**: What people want to understand better
   *

â†’ **This information will be used to:**
- Select patterns and approaches to try (Intervention phase)
- Assess whether interests were addressed (Reflection phase)
- Show how curiosity led to transformation (Synthesis phase)

## Readiness for Change

*Why this matters: Understanding capacity and appetite for change helps design approaches that match reality rather than overwhelming or underwhelming the organization.*

Consider exploring:
- What's the organization's history with change efforts?
- Where does energy and enthusiasm for new approaches exist?
- What resources (time, money, attention) are realistically available?
- What fears or concerns need to be acknowledged?

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**
* **Change history**: Past efforts, what worked/didn't, organizational memory
   * 
* **Current capacity**: Available time, budget, human resources, attention
   * 
* **Technical readiness**: Digital literacy, infrastructure, support systems
   * 
* **Champions and skeptics**: Who will drive vs. resist change
   * 
* **Timing factors**: Other initiatives, seasonal patterns, external pressures
   *

â†’ **This information will be used to:**
- Right-size intervention scope and pace (Intervention phase)
- Understand implementation challenges (Reflection phase)
- Explain what enabled or constrained success (Synthesis phase)

## Patterns and Connections

*Why this matters: Stepping back to see patterns helps identify leverage points where small changes might create bigger shifts.*

Consider exploring:
- What themes keep emerging across conversations?
- How do different challenges connect to each other?
- Where might addressing one issue help with others?
- What systemic patterns are becoming visible?

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**
* **Recurring themes**: Issues or opportunities mentioned by multiple people
   * 
* **System dynamics**: How problems reinforce each other
   * 
* **Leverage points**: Where small changes could have big impact
   * 
* **Root patterns**: Underlying structures creating surface problems
   *

â†’ **This information will be used to:**
- Design integrated interventions (Intervention phase)
- Track systemic vs. surface changes (Reflection phase)
- Identify transferable insights (Synthesis phase)

## Next Steps and Questions

*Why this matters: Discovery often raises as many questions as it answers. Capturing what you're still wondering about guides continued exploration.*

Consider:
- What questions emerged that you want to explore further?
- Who else should you talk to?
- What documents or data might provide additional insight?
- What are you most curious to understand better?

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**
* **Information gaps**: What you still need to learn
   * 
* **Additional sources**: People, documents, or data to consult
   * 
* **Emerging hypotheses**: Early ideas about what might work
   * 
* **Risk factors**: Potential obstacles you're noticing
   *

â†’ **This information will be used to:**
- Guide additional discovery if needed (Intervention phase)
- Note what remained unknown (Reflection phase)
- Show the iterative nature of learning (Synthesis phase)
