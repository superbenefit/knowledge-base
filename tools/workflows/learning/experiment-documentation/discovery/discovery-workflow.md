# Discovery Documentation Workflow

This workflow guides you through using the Discovery phase documents to create a comprehensive Discovery Report.

## Understanding the Value

The Discovery Report establishes foundational understanding of the organization that informs all subsequent phases. It transforms raw information gathered through stakeholder engagement into structured documentation that serves multiple audiences. This workflow shows how to systematically move from information gathering to polished documentation using the framework tools.

## Document Sequence

1. **Review readme.md** → Understand what Discovery documentation should accomplish
2. **Use discovery-worksheet.md** → Capture information progressively 
3. **Apply discovery-template.md** → Structure your findings
4. **AI-assisted synthesis** → Transform worksheet content into polished sections
5. **Quality review** → Ensure completeness and clarity

## Step 1: Review Requirements

Start by reading the Discovery phase readme.md to understand:
- What information the Discovery Report should contain
- How this information flows to later phases
- The value this documentation provides
- Expected outputs

## Step 2: Information Gathering with Worksheet

Use discovery-worksheet.md as your collection tool during stakeholder engagement activities. The worksheet provides:
- Organized sections for different types of information
- Space for capturing insights as they emerge
- Prompts to ensure comprehensive coverage
- Flexible format for various contexts

Work through worksheet sections progressively - you don't need to complete everything at once. Add information as it becomes available through your discovery activities.

## Step 3: AI-Assisted Synthesis

Once your worksheet contains substantial information, use these AI prompts to transform content into template sections:

### Executive Summary
```
Create an executive summary for my Discovery Report using this information:

Organizational context: [paste from worksheet section 1]
Key challenges: [paste from worksheet section 3]
Areas of interest: [paste from worksheet section 5]

Write 2-3 paragraphs suitable for busy stakeholders that capture the organization's current state and opportunities for exploration.
```

### Organizational Context
```
Transform these worksheet notes into a comprehensive Organizational Context section:

Basic information: [paste from worksheet section 1]
How things work: [paste from worksheet section 2]
Stakeholder landscape: [paste from worksheet section 4]

Create a narrative that provides clear understanding of the organization's structure, culture, and operations.
```

### Current Challenges
```
Synthesize these challenge observations into structured analysis:

Challenge notes: [paste from worksheet section 3]
Patterns identified: [paste from worksheet section 7]

Present systemic challenges with specific examples, showing connections and root causes rather than just listing problems.
```

### Stakeholder Perspectives
```
Create a stakeholder analysis section from these notes:

Stakeholder information: [paste from worksheet section 4]

Show different perspectives, areas of alignment and divergence, and implications for future work.
```

### Areas of Interest
```
Transform these exploration notes into documented opportunities:

Curiosities and possibilities: [paste from worksheet section 5]
Readiness assessment: [paste from worksheet section 6]

Present areas where the organization shows energy for exploration, including context and potential benefits.
```

### Patterns and Connections
```
Synthesize these observations into insight documentation:

Pattern notes: [paste from worksheet section 7]
Next steps identified: [paste from worksheet section 8]

Identify key themes and leverage points that could inform intervention design.
```

## Step 4: Template Population

With AI-synthesized content ready:
1. Open discovery-template.md
2. Work through each section systematically
3. Paste synthesized content into appropriate sections
4. Edit for flow and consistency
5. Add transitions between sections
6. Ensure narrative coherence

## Step 5: Quality Review

Use these prompts to review and enhance your Discovery Report:

### Completeness Check
```
Review this Discovery Report against requirements:

[Paste complete document]

Check for:
- All major sections present and substantive
- Clear organizational context
- Documented challenges with examples
- Stakeholder perspectives represented
- Areas of interest identified
- Natural flow to next phases

Identify any gaps or sections needing expansion.
```

### Clarity Enhancement
```
Review this Discovery Report for accessibility:

[Paste document or section]

Help improve:
- Technical language that needs simplification
- Concepts requiring more context
- Transitions between sections
- Overall readability for diverse audiences

Suggest specific edits for clarity.
```

### Evidence Validation
```
Review the evidence and examples in this report:

[Paste document]

Assess whether:
- Claims are supported by specific examples
- Patterns are justified by multiple observations
- Stakeholder perspectives are balanced
- Conclusions follow from evidence presented

Identify areas needing stronger support.
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Worksheet sections incomplete
**Solution**: Focus on sections with most information; note gaps for future exploration

**Issue**: Too much raw information
**Solution**: Use AI to identify key themes; move detailed notes to appendix

**Issue**: Conflicting perspectives
**Solution**: Document different viewpoints without forcing consensus

**Issue**: Technical complexity
**Solution**: Use AI to simplify language while maintaining accuracy

## Deliverable: Discovery Report

Your completed Discovery Report should:
- Provide comprehensive organizational understanding
- Identify systemic challenges and opportunities
- Document stakeholder perspectives
- Establish foundation for intervention planning
- Be accessible to multiple audiences

The report typically runs 8-15 pages including any visuals or appendices, though length should match context and need.
