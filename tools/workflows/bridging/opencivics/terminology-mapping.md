# Terminology Mapping: SuperBenefit & OpenCivics

This document provides a comprehensive mapping between SuperBenefit and OpenCivics terminology, supporting effective translation between knowledge systems while preserving essential meaning. Use this reference when integrating content between systems to ensure consistent terminology usage.

## Direct Equivalents

These terms share both meaning and naming across the two systems, providing natural bridges for knowledge exchange. When using these terms in integrated content, little or no adaptation is usually required beyond acknowledging any minor differences in context or application.

| SuperBenefit Term | OpenCivics Term | Definition/Notes |
|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Pattern | Pattern | Reusable solutions to common challenges/problems in collaborative systems. Both systems define patterns similarly as solutions that can be applied across different contexts. |
| Playbook | Playbook | Comprehensive, actionable guides for implementing specific processes, frameworks, or methodologies. Both systems use this term to represent detailed implementation guidance that integrates multiple patterns. |
| Knowledge Garden/Commons | Knowledge Commons | Shared information resources with community governance. Though SuperBenefit emphasizes the gardening metaphor, both terms describe collectively stewarded knowledge resources. |
| Community | Social Organism | Groups of contributors organized around shared purpose. While using different metaphors, both terms refer to purposeful human collectives with defined boundaries. |
| Curator | Steward | Person who maintains and refines content. Both roles involve responsibility for knowledge quality and evolution. |
| Template | Template | Standardized structure for content creation. Both systems use templates to ensure consistency while providing flexibility. |

## Partial Equivalents

These concepts have similar but not identical expressions across the two systems. They require more careful translation to preserve essential meaning while adapting to SuperBenefit's terminology and context. The relationship between these terms ranges from strong alignment (largely similar with minor differences) to weak alignment (sharing some aspects but with significant differences in scope or emphasis).

| SuperBenefit Term         | OpenCivics Term           | Relationship       | Translation Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Studies                   | Learning                  | Moderate Alignment | Both capture empirical knowledge, but structured differently. SuperBenefit's studies document specific implementations, while OpenCivics' learning is more process-oriented. When translating, frame learning processes as inputs to studies.                                                         ||
| Progressive Documentation | Knowledge Evolution       | Strong Alignment   | Similar concepts for how knowledge matures through stages. When translating, use SuperBenefit's more explicit stages while incorporating OpenCivics' composting metaphor.                                                                                                                             |
| State                     | Specification Template    | Moderate Alignment | Both provide snapshot documentation of a group's purpose and structure. When translating, adapt OpenCivics specifications to fit SuperBenefit's state documentation approach.                                                                                                                         ||

## System-Specific Terms: SuperBenefit

These SuperBenefit-specific terms have no direct equivalent in OpenCivics and represent concepts that are either unique to SuperBenefit or expressed through fundamentally different approaches in OpenCivics. When integrating OpenCivics content into SuperBenefit, these terms need to be understood and appropriately applied.

| Term | Definition | OpenCivics Mapping Approach |
|------|------------|------------------------------|
| Drafts | Private workspace for developing thoughts | No direct equivalent. When translating to OpenCivics, describe as early-stage components of collaborative initiatives before they become template-based. |
| Notes | Working documents for active development | No direct equivalent. When translating to OpenCivics, describe as components of collaborative initiatives in active development. |
| Links | External references with community analysis | No direct equivalent. When translating to OpenCivics, describe as external resources integrated with community context. |
| Tags | Shared vocabulary and conceptual framework | Broader than OpenCivics "Functions." When translating to OpenCivics, map tags to both functional areas and component types. |
| Tools | Knowledge management utilities | When translating to OpenCivics, describe as components of the infrastructure supporting the knowledge commons. |
| Harvester | Person who collected/added content | No direct equivalent. When translating to OpenCivics, describe as an agent role within the knowledge commons. |

## System-Specific Terms: OpenCivics

These OpenCivics-specific terms have no direct equivalent in SuperBenefit and represent concepts that are either unique to OpenCivics or expressed through fundamentally different approaches in SuperBenefit. When integrating these concepts into SuperBenefit, careful translation is required.

## Terms with Conflicting Definitions

These terms are used in both systems but with different meanings or emphasis. These conflicting definitions create potential confusion if not carefully managed. In accordance with our bridging principles, SuperBenefit's usage should take precedence, but OpenCivics' nuances should be acknowledged when relevant.

| Term | SuperBenefit Definition | OpenCivics Definition | Resolution Approach |
|------|-------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Protocol | Operational mechanisms implementing patterns | Digital public infrastructure for coordination | When using this term in integrated content, use SuperBenefit's definition as primary but acknowledge OpenCivics' infrastructure perspective in a "Bridge Notes" section. |
| Function | Role or capability | Core social organism processes | When using this term in integrated content, use SuperBenefit's broader definition but map OpenCivics' specific processes as specialized functions within SuperBenefit's framework. |
| Commons | Universal shared knowledge | Governed information resources | When using this term in integrated content, use SuperBenefit's garden metaphor as primary but incorporate OpenCivics' governance emphasis as an aspect of garden stewardship. |
| Pattern Language | Collection of related patterns | Protocol Pattern Language (specific framework) | When using this term in integrated content, use SuperBenefit's more general definition while referencing OpenCivics' specific framework as a particular type of pattern language. |
| Community | Group of contributors | Social organism with membranes | When using this term in integrated content, use SuperBenefit's definition but incorporate the membrane concept as an aspect of community boundaries. |

## Function to Tag Mapping

When integrating OpenCivics content, use this mapping to translate between OpenCivics' functional areas and SuperBenefit's tagging system. Map OpenCivics functional areas to existing SuperBenefit tags where possible; create new tags when necessary following SuperBenefit's tagging conventions.

| OpenCivics Function | SuperBenefit Tags |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Sensemaking | sensemaking |
| Mapping | mapping |
| Decision Making | decisions |
| Allocating | allocation |
| Coordinating | coordination |
| Learning | learning |

## Lifecycle Phase Mapping

This mapping helps translate between OpenCivics' social organism lifecycle phases and SuperBenefit's phase field values, particularly relevant for patterns and playbooks.

| OpenCivics Lifecycle Phase | SuperBenefit Phase Field Value |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Conception | conversation phase |
| Gestation | formation + organization phase |
| Maturation | coordination (iteration) phase |
| Decomposition | completion phase |

## Application Guidelines

When applying this terminology mapping during content integration:

1. **Prioritize SuperBenefit Terminology**: Follow SuperBenefit's naming conventions and definitions when creating new content.

2. **Bridge Notes**: For OpenCivics-specific concepts or terms with conflicting definitions, include a "Bridge Notes" section at the end of the document that acknowledges the original terminology and explains the translation.

3. **Contextual Definitions**: When introducing OpenCivics-specific concepts, provide brief contextual definitions within the text rather than assuming familiarity.

4. **Consistent Translation**: Apply terminology mapping consistently across all related content to maintain coherence within the knowledge base.

5. **Evolution Documentation**: If you discover new terminological relationships or refine existing ones, document these improvements for future integration efforts.

Example Bridge Note:
```
<!-- Bridge Notes: This pattern was adapted from OpenCivics' "Assembly Protocol" concept. In the OpenCivics framework, protocols are considered fundamental digital public infrastructure that enables coordination without central authority, while in SuperBenefit they're typically viewed as operational mechanisms that implement patterns. This pattern preserves OpenCivics' conception of assembly as a living systems process while adapting to SuperBenefit's pattern structure. -->
