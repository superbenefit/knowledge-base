# OpenCivics Bridging Framework

This directory contains workflows and reference materials for integrating knowledge between the OpenCivics and SuperBenefit knowledge systems. The framework enables meaningful knowledge transfer while respecting the cultural and contextual elements of both systems.

## Framework Components

- **[Terminology Mapping](terminology-mapping.md)**: Comprehensive mapping between SuperBenefit and OpenCivics terminology
- **[Template Alignment](template-alignment.md)**: Guidance for transforming content structures between systems
- **Workflows**:
  - **[Content Selection](content-selection-workflow.md)**: Identifying valuable content and initial transformation
  - **[Pattern Integration](pattern-integration-workflow.md)**: Adapting OpenCivics patterns
  - **[Protocol Integration](protocol-integration-workflow.md)**: Bridging protocol concepts
  - **[Playbook Integration](playbook-integration-workflow.md)**: Transforming implementation guides

## Bridging Approach

The knowledge bridging approach is based on semiotic bridging principles:

1. **Cultural Preservation**: Maintain SuperBenefit's cultural context, metaphors, and approaches while respecting OpenCivics insights.

2. **Knowledge Translation**: Preserve essential meaning across different conceptual frameworks through careful terminology mapping.

3. **Structural Integration**: Adapt OpenCivics content to fit SuperBenefit's established directory structure and templates.

4. **Metadata Alignment**: Ensure proper mapping of metadata fields between systems for consistency and discoverability.

5. **Content Selection**: Prioritize content that adds unique value to SuperBenefit's knowledge base, focusing on complementary rather than redundant information.

## Getting Started

To begin integrating OpenCivics content:

1. Familiarize yourself with the [terminology mapping](terminology-mapping.md) to understand key conceptual translations

2. Review the [template alignment](template-alignment.md) to see how content structures are transformed

3. Use the [content selection workflow](content-selection-workflow.md) to identify valuable content and perform initial analysis

4. Choose the appropriate specialized workflow based on content type:
   - For patterns: [pattern integration workflow](pattern-integration-workflow.md)
   - For protocols: [protocol integration workflow](protocol-integration-workflow.md)
   - For playbooks: [playbook integration workflow](playbook-integration-workflow.md)

5. Follow the workflow step by step, using the provided prompt templates when working with Claude

## Integration Guidelines

When integrating OpenCivics content:

- **Start with the Why**: Understand the purpose of the content before beginning transformation
- **Respect Both Systems**: Preserve valuable insights from OpenCivics while ensuring compatibility with SuperBenefit
- **Document Translation Decisions**: Use Bridge Notes to explain significant adaptations
- **Maintain Terminological Consistency**: Apply the terminology mapping consistently
- **Prioritize Meaning Over Structure**: Focus on preserving essential meaning rather than exact structural fidelity
- **Connect to the Ecosystem**: Create meaningful connections to SuperBenefit's existing content

## Key Concepts

### Semiotic Bridging

Semiotic bridging focuses on creating meaningful translations between different knowledge systems by:
- Preserving meaning across different conceptual frameworks
- Respecting cultural context while enabling knowledge transfer
- Creating explicit connections between different terminologies and structures
- Documenting translation decisions for transparency

### Bridge Notes

Bridge Notes are special sections added to integrated content that:
- Acknowledge the original source in OpenCivics
- Explain significant conceptual translations or adaptations
- Note preserved elements from the original system
- Help readers understand the integration context

Example:
```markdown
<!-- Bridge Notes: This pattern was adapted from OpenCivics' protocol framework. In OpenCivics, protocols are considered "digital public infrastructure" that enables coordination without central authority, while in SuperBenefit they're typically viewed as operational mechanisms that implement patterns. -->
```
