# Bridging Workflows

This directory contains specialized workflows for bridging knowledge between external systems and SuperBenefit's knowledge base. Each subdirectory provides tools and processes for a specific knowledge system integration.

## Purpose

Bridging workflows provide systematic approaches to:

- Select valuable external content for integration
- Translate between different knowledge frameworks and terminology
- Adapt content structures to fit SuperBenefit's templates
- Preserve essential meaning while ensuring compatibility
- Maintain cultural and organizational coherence

## Available Bridging Frameworks

- **[OpenCivics](opencivics/readme.md)**: Tools for integrating OpenCivics' knowledge into SuperBenefit's framework

## Using Bridging Workflows

When integrating external knowledge:

1. Start with the terminology mapping document for the relevant system
2. Select the appropriate workflow based on the content type (pattern, protocol, playbook)
3. Follow the step-by-step process for analysis, transformation, and integration
4. Use the provided prompt templates for working with Claude
5. Validate against both the original source and SuperBenefit's standards

## Integration Best Practices

- **Maintain Cultural Integrity**: Preserve SuperBenefit's approach while respecting external insights
- **Focus on Meaning**: Prioritize preserving essential meaning over structural fidelity
- **Document Translation Decisions**: Use Bridge Notes to explain significant adaptations
- **Connect to Existing Knowledge**: Create meaningful links to SuperBenefit's existing content
- **Start Small**: Begin with well-defined, standalone content before tackling complex interconnected systems

## Contributing New Bridging Frameworks

To create a bridging framework for an additional knowledge system:

1. Create a subdirectory with the system name
2. Develop a terminology mapping document
3. Create template alignment guidance
4. Develop specialized workflows for different content types
5. Document the bridging approach in a readme file

Follow the existing OpenCivics framework as a model, adapting for the specific needs of the new knowledge system.
