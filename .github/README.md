# SuperBenefit Knowledge Base

A markdown repository for SuperBenefit's collected knowledge.

## Using This Repository

This repo is a collection of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files, organized using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and published with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). The primary markdown syntax used is [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), with some added flavor for [Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Obsidian+Flavored+Markdown) and [GitHub](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Obsidian+Flavored+Markdown).

This knowledge base can be synced to your computer using [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git), and modified using a text or code editor. We recommend using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for exploring and editing the knowledge base, and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing plugin files, etc. Both are free, [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and highly customizable. This can be described as a [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) workflow.

Content from this knowledge base can be uploaded to the [knowledge garden](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-garden), which is published [here](https://knolwedge.superbenefit.org).
