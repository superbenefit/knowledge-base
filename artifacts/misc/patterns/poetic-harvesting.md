Poetic harvesting is the practice of acting as a "sacred witness" to collective conversations and reflecting the essence back through spoken word poetry that captures content, energy, and collective wisdom in accessible, memorable formats.

---

## Overview

Poetic harvesting draws from the Japanese concept of "sacred witness" - someone invited from outside a system to observe and support evolution through curious, present listening. The harvester holds space for stories while having no agenda except to reflect back what emerges.

Poetic Harvesting transforms collective wisdom into documentation that [communities](tags/community.md) actually want to revisit and share. Unlike traditional meeting minutes that capture decisions and logistics, poetic harvesting preserves the mood, energy, power dynamics, and felt sense of shared learning alongside content.

The practice involves observing events - from brief meetings to multi-day conferences - and creating real-time spoken word poetry that weaves individual contributions into collective narrative. Harvests can be delivered immediately (within minutes of conclusion) or refined for broader sharing.

## Key Features

**Deep listening over note-taking** - Focus on themes and energy rather than verbatim capture

**Pattern recognition across diverse voices** - Weaving individual contributions into collective narrative  

**Energy preservation alongside content capture** - Documenting the felt sense and emotional arc

**Community voice honored within creative interpretation** - Accurate essence expressed poetically

**Accessibility through rhythm, rhyme, and shared language** - Creating memorable, shareable wisdom

## Organizational Functions

Poetic harvesting serves multiple organizational needs:

- **More effective meeting documentation** that people actually want to revisit
- **Surfacing deeper patterns and learnings** across conversations and events  
- **Preserving organizational story and culture** in accessible formats
- **Creating shareable knowledge** that builds community identity and engagement

## When to Use

**Ideal contexts:**
- Values-driven conversations about vision, purpose, transformation
- Multi-stakeholder gatherings with diverse perspectives to weave together  
- Creative/strategic sessions where breakthrough thinking emerges
- Community building events where relationships and culture matter
- Reflection/sensemaking sessions processing complex experiences

**Not recommended for:**
- Technical troubleshooting or detailed logistics planning
- Legal/contractual discussions requiring precise language
- Crisis management where immediate action trumps reflection

## How It Works

The harvester positions themselves as a curious observer, listening for themes that emerge across different speakers while noting energy shifts and emotional arcs. Rather than taking detailed notes, they capture key phrases, images, and the underlying story being told collectively.

During or immediately after the gathering, this raw material is synthesized into spoken word poetry that honors individual contributions while revealing collective patterns. The harvest can be performed live for immediate reflection or refined for broader sharing.

The result is documentation that preserves both analytical insights and cultural context - the "why" behind decisions alongside the "what" of outcomes.

## Getting Started

**Essential elements for first attempts:**

1. **Deep listening skills** - Focus on themes and energy rather than details
2. **Creative comfort** - Willingness to synthesize and interpret creatively  
3. **Community context** - Understanding of participants, values, and communication norms
4. **Clear purpose** - Consent from participants about how harvest will be shared

Start with smaller, values-focused gatherings where creative documentation feels natural. Practice capturing themes and emotional arc before attempting complex multi-stakeholder events.

## Reviews and Case Studies

**AIFS Gathering Series:** Successfully documented 6 Web3 and sports gatherings, capturing complex technical discussions about impact measurement, community [governance](tags/governance.md), and decentralized funding in accessible poetic format. Participants consistently shared harvests on social media and referenced them in subsequent planning.

**RPP Stakeholder Meetings:** 15+ poetic harvests for Reimagining Power Project captured evolution of thinking about Web3 and philanthropic funding, creating shareable documentation that honored both technical innovation and social justice values.
