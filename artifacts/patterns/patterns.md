# Pattern Library

_A comprehensive index of reusable patterns for decentralized organization design and governance_

## Overview

Patterns are conceptual frameworks that provide reusable solutions to common challenges in decentralized organization design and governance. They serve as a bridge between high-level principles and on-the-ground implementation, helping organizations avoid common pitfalls and build on proven approaches.

This library contains patterns developed through real-world experiments and refined through community practice. Each pattern documents a specific solution to recurring organizational challenges, providing both theoretical grounding and practical implementation guidance.

## How to Use This Library

1. **Browse by Category**: Patterns are organized by their primary focus area
2. **Check Implementation Status**: Look for patterns marked as "published" for well-tested approaches
3. **Review Context**: Each pattern clearly describes where and when it applies
4. **Adapt to Your Needs**: Patterns are meant to be adapted, not copied wholesale

## All Patterns

```dataview
LIST 
FROM "" 
WHERE publish = true
  AND (
    contains(string(type), "pattern") 
    OR (typeof(type) = "array" AND any(type, (t) => contains(string(t), "pattern")))
  )
SORT file.name ASC
```
