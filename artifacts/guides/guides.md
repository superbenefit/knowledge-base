# Implementation Guide for Community Governance Using the DAO Primitives Framework

## Introduction

Crypto primitives make possible a fundamental shift in how communities organize, make decisions, and create impact. Unlike traditional organizations with rigid hierarchies, [[tags/daos|DAOs]] (and other crypto enabled organizations) can function as purpose-aligned networks operating through decentralized coordination mechanisms. [[tags/governance|Community governance]]—the [[tags/groups#Groups at Different Scales|constituency-scale]] layer of governance—forms the foundation that safeguards a networks purpose, steers its long-term evolution, and ensures that its community can genuinely participate in its formation and governance.

This implementation guide provides a comprehensive framework for designing, implementing, and evolving community governance structures using the DAO primitives approach. By breaking down governance into fundamental building blocks (primitives), communities can create customized, effective structures that align with their unique needs and values.

At SuperBenefit we have developed the [[artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/dao-primitives-framework|DAO primitives framework]] to provide a set of primitives and patterns with which these new organizational structures can be composed.

We have identified and experimented with using the DAO primitives framework to produce governance systems based on 3 interlocking governance structures: [[tags/governance#Community Governance|Community Governance]], [[tags/governance#Operational Governance|Operational Governance]] and [[tags/governance#Multi-Stakeholder Governance|Multi-Stakeholder Governance]].

Guides to setting up these 3 interlocking governance structures can be found here:

- [Implementation-guide-operational-governance](notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/governance/implementation-guide-operational-governance.md)
- [Implementation-guide-multi-stakeholder-governance](notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/governance/implementation-guide-multi-stakeholder-governance.md)
- [Implementation-guide-community-governance](notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/governance/implementation-guide-community-governance.md) (this guide)

This guide focuses on setting up a Community Governance structure, the highest level of governance in a decentralized network. You can do this as part of a three layered governance system as outlined above, or you could use this guide to design a community governance system to used with a completely different operational governance model.

Creating a community governance structure is not a simple task. We recommend getting support from an experienced facilitator to help you through this process.

_Note: this implementation guide follows the structure outlined in the DAO Primitives [[artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-facilitation|group-facilitation]] process. It
