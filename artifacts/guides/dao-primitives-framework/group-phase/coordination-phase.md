# Coordination Phase

---

The Coordination Phase represents the mature [index](artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-phase/index.md) where [groups](tags/groups.md) transition from establishing their structures and processes in the [organization phase](artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-phase/organization-phase.md) to focused execution on their [purpose](tags/purpose.md) and goals. In this phase, a group leverages its fully implemented operational capabilities and [governance](tags/governance.md) systems to deliver maximum value and impact. The emphasis shifts from internal development to effective delivery, with [coordination](tags/coordination.md) becoming a key mechanism for accessing necessary [resources](tags/resources.md), capabilities, and support from the broader [network](tags/networks.md) or ecosystem.

The coordination phase is where a group, as an autonomous (or semi-autonomous) entity, both leverages and contributes to the power and collective intelligence of the decentralized [network](tags/networks.md) it inhabits (or in the case of a DAO, is creating).

When the Coordination phase is complete, a group may either evolve into a [governance](tags/governance.md) or operational structure or enter a [completion phase](artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-phase/completion-phase.md) as its [purpose](tags/purpose.md) is fulfilled.

## Key Characteristics

- **Purpose-Driven Execution:** The group's activities are tightly aligned with its core [purpose](tags/purpose.md), with clear prioritization of high-impact initiatives that advance its goals.
- **[Resource](tags/resources.md) Sharing:** The group optimizes the use of its internal [resources](tags/resources.md) while accessing and/or contributing resources externally through [network](tags/networks.md) relationships.
- **Decentralized [Coordination](tags/coordination.md):** The group fully implements the onchain tooling and [practices](tags/practices.md) that allow its [governance](tags/governance.md) and operational structure to leverage decentralization in effective ways.
- **Operational Excellence:** Internal systems and processes function smoothly, allowing focus to shift from setup and maintenance to optimization and results.
- **Evolution:** The group evolves its [governance](tags/governance.md) and operational structure and [practices](tags/practices.md) over time in response to its evolving context.
- **Measurable Impact:** The group consistently delivers and documents concrete outcomes that advance its [purpose](tags/purpose.md) and provide value to the broader [network](tags/networks.md).

## Functional Elements

### Activities

The activities of a Coordination phase group are outlined in their [group state](artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-state.md) documentation. Broadly these include:

- **Internal [Governance](tags/governance.md):** Execution of the group's ongoing governance structure and [practices](tags/practices.md). Including keeping group state documentation up to date and accessible to participants in the [network](tags/networks.md).
- **Network [Governance](tags/governance.md):** Participating in external decentralized governance processes within coordinating [networks](tags/networks.md).
- **Strategic Execution:** Implementing the group's strategy through coordinated action that delivers on key objectives and milestones.
- **Operational [Coordination](tags/coordination.md):** Strategic planning, [resource](tags/resources.md) allocation, contributor and partner coordination, etc.
- **External Partnerships:** Establishing and executing on partnerships with other autonomous entities in the decentralized [network](tags/networks.md) or other stakeholders from outside the network.
- **Impact Measurement:** Tracking and communicating the outcomes and value created by the group's activities.
- **Feedback Integration:** Systematically gathering and responding to feedback from users, stakeholders, and [network](tags/networks.md) participants.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Documenting and sharing learnings, tools, and approaches that could benefit others in the [network](tags/networks.md). Including consistently updating and sharing its [group state](artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-state.md) documentation.

### Navigating Challenges

- **Maintaining Momentum:** Sustaining energy and [progress](tags/progress.md) toward goals despite obstacles and competing priorities.
- **Balancing Flexibility and Focus:** Adapting to changing circumstances without losing sight of core objectives and priorities.
- **Principled Evolution:** Ensuring that as the group evolves, it grows in principled ways, avoiding centralization, governance capture, bureaucratic bloat, etc. Leveraging decentralized tooling and [practices](tags/practices.md) to ensure [governance](tags/governance.md) and operations stay true to design.
- **Maintaining Alignment with Coordinating Entities:** Ensuring that new opportunities and partnerships remain aligned with the group's fundamental [purpose](tags/purpose.md) and with the purpose of the [network](tags/networks.md) that the group is participating in.
- **Consistently Communicating [Progress](tags/progress.md):** Ensuring that the [network](tags/networks.md) that the group is coordinating with can see and understand the progress it is making and trust that it is a good [coordination](tags/coordination.md) partner.

### Signs of Readiness for Evolution

A coordination phase group may be ready to evolve to a new form or enter completion when:

- The group's [purpose](tags/purpose.md) has been substantially fulfilled or has evolved significantly
- The operational context has changed in ways that require fundamental restructuring
- New capabilities or approaches have emerged that would better serve the purpose
- The group's work has been effectively systematized or automated
- The group can no longer maintain the energy and commitment of team members and contributors in order to do its work

## Tools and Practices

### State Documentation

During the Coordination Phase, the group's [group state](artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-state.md) documentation is the critical interface between the group and the [network](tags/networks.md) it inhabits. It contains the [agreements](tags/agreements.md) between the group and other coordinating entities, as well as references to web3 tooling and onchain information that allows for effective decentralized [coordination](tags/coordination.md) between the group and its network.

At coordination phase, if a group fails to maintain their state documentation, or to communicate it clearly and transparently, this should be a red flag for any entity or [network](tags/networks.md) coordinating with the group.

**[Purpose](tags/purpose.md) Elements:**

- Evolution of the group's strategy and goals in line with its purpose
- Evolution of its relationship with/to other entities in its [network](tags/networks.md) and the network itself

**[Practice](tags/practices.md) Elements:**

- Updated [governance](tags/governance.md) practices that evolve as the group grows and changes
- Maintaining [agreements](tags/agreements.md) and internal and external [coordination](tags/coordination.md) processes
- Evolving contributor engagement and coordination mechanisms
- Maintaining [treasury](tags/treasury.md) and [resource](tags/resources.md) allocation practices
- Ongoing retrospectives and feedback processes and ongoing governance and operational evolution
- Records of major group [decisions](tags/decisions.md) and transactions

**[Progress](tags/progress.md) Elements:**

- Implementation of onchain tools where practical
- Collaborative project management tools tracking group activities and deliverables
- Communication platforms - meetings, group channels, broadcast channels
- Shared workspaces, documentation, and data platforms
- Documentation of learnings and group evolution
- Impact metrics that track progress toward key objectives - clear articulation of how activities connect to broader [network](tags/networks.md) goals

### Technical Implementation

Coordination Phase groups typically employ various technical tools to support execution and [coordination](tags/coordination.md). At this phase these should, where practical, be onchain tools. This promotes the decentralized properties that are designed into the group's [governance](tags/governance.md). Using onchain tools is especially important for:

- Governing the group's [treasury](tags/treasury.md) and allocation of [resources](tags/resources.md).
- Managing changes in the overall [governance](tags/governance.md) structure of the group, i.e., who has [decision-making](tags/decisions.md) authorities.
- Information for external stakeholders. [Coordination](tags/coordination.md) partners need to have trust in the group's processes at a glance.

There is always a balance to be struck between the flexibility of a lightweight minimal organizational structure, and the need for solid tools, [practices](tags/practices.md), processes, and policies to support a group to function successfully. At coordination phase, the group should have its structure fully implemented with technical tooling, in line with what it needs to deliver on its stated [governance](tags/governance.md) and operational design.

## Success Indicators

A coordination phase has been successful when:

- **[Purpose](tags/purpose.md) Advancement:** The group consistently delivers outcomes that meaningfully advance its purpose
- **[Resource](tags/resources.md) Effectiveness:** Available resources are deployed efficiently to create maximum impact
- **[Network](tags/networks.md) Support:** The group maintains ongoing support from the networks that it inhabits
- **Contributor Engagement:** The group successfully attracts and retains contributors with aligned skills and interests to deliver on its strategy
- **Clear [Governance](tags/governance.md):** The group executes on its governance practices in an effective and [transparent](tags/transparency.md) way
- **Operational Fluidity:** The group's ability to create and manage operations via tools like [roles](tags/roles.md) and [tasks](tags/tasks.md) can scale coherently to meet the operational needs of the group
- **Adaptive Capacity:** The group effectively executes on retrospectives and other feedback processes, and translates insights generated through these processes into changes in the governance and operational structure of the group
- **Documented Impact:** Clear evidence demonstrates the value and outcomes created by the group's activities

The coordination phase represents the period when a group's full potential is realized through effective execution on its [purpose](tags/purpose.md). To do this, it effectively coordinates with the decentralized [networks](tags/networks.md) it inhabits.

When successful, the group creates tangible value for itself and for the broader [networks](tags/networks.md) while building a foundation for sustainable impact and evolution.
