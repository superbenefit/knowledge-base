# Group Primitives 

These [primitives](tags/primitives.md) are the fundamental building blocks that we use to create purpose-aligned [networks](tags/networks.md) of small autonomous teams.

The term "primitive" is used in many different contexts to mean slightly different things. In this context we use "[primitive](tags/primitives.md)" to describe these 4 fundamental building blocks out of which network [governance](tags/governance.md) and operational structures can be built.

## Entities & Agreements

Network theory defines [networks](tags/networks.md) as being made up of nodes (the entities or objects in the network) and edges (the relationships or interactions between those nodes).

For designing [governance](tags/governance.md) and operational structures, we define nodes and edges as Entities and [Agreements](tags/agreements.md). Entities being the structures within the DAO (or other decentralized network) and agreements being relationship infrastructure, the commitments and [responsibilities](tags/responsibilities.md) that are agreed upon between autonomous actors in the network.

## Primitives

- [Cells (Primitive)](artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-primitives/cells.md)
- [DAOs (Primitive)](artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-primitives/daos.md)
- [Roles (Primitive)](artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-primitives/roles.md)
- [Tasks (Primitive)](artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-primitives/tasks.md)

To allow for [governance](tags/governance.md) systems to be easily designed, we lean on these 4 structures. Each one has enough definition to be useful in design, but can be configurable in a multitude of ways to allow for many different governance approaches and patterns to be implemented.

## Phase & Scale

The [primitives](tags/primitives.md) are designed to evolve through the different stages of [index](artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-phase/index.md) and also deliver on different [index](artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-scale/index.md) requirements of the [governance](tags/governance.md) and operational system being designed.

## State

Each [primitive](tags/primitives.md) has a concept of state, an internally documented, externally visible description of the entity or agreement's [Purpose](tags/purpose.md), [Practice](tags/practices.md), and [Progress](tags/progress.md), so that this can be seen and understood independently by anyone in the [network](tags/networks.md).

This [transparency](tags/transparency.md) allows for decentralized [coordination](tags/coordination.md) across the network. At any point in time the whole of the [governance](tags/governance.md) and operational structure (all of its entities and [agreements](tags/agreements.md)) can be seen and understood. This allows the network to manifest as a coherent whole, while allowing for autonomy for the entities that make it up.
