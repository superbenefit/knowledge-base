# Group Primitives 

These [[tags/primitives|primitives]] are the fundamental building blocks that we use to create purpose-aligned [[tags/networks|networks]] of small autonomous teams.

The term "primitive" is used in many different contexts to mean slightly different things. In this context we use "[[tags/primitives|primitive]]" to describe these 4 fundamental building blocks out of which network [[tags/governance|governance]] and operational structures can be built.

## Entities & Agreements

Network theory defines [[tags/networks|networks]] as being made up of nodes (the entities or objects in the network) and edges (the relationships or interactions between those nodes).

For designing [[tags/governance|governance]] and operational structures, we define nodes and edges as Entities and [[tags/agreements|Agreements]]. Entities being the structures within the DAO (or other decentralized network) and agreements being relationship infrastructure, the commitments and [[tags/responsibilities|responsibilities]] that are agreed upon between autonomous actors in the network.

## Primitives

- [[artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-primitives/cells|Cells (Primitive)]]
- [[artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-primitives/daos|DAOs (Primitive)]]
- [[artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-primitives/roles|Roles (Primitive)]]
- [[artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-primitives/tasks|Tasks (Primitive)]]

To allow for [[tags/governance|governance]] systems to be easily designed, we lean on these 4 structures. Each one has enough definition to be useful in design, but can be configurable in a multitude of ways to allow for many different governance approaches and patterns to be implemented.

## Phase & Scale

The [[tags/primitives|primitives]] are designed to evolve through the different stages of [[artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-phase/group-phase|group-phase]] and also deliver on different [[artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-scale/group-scale|group-scale]] requirements of the [[tags/governance|governance]] and operational system being designed.

## State

Each [[tags/primitives|primitive]] has a concept of state, an internally documented, externally visible description of the entity or agreement's [[tags/purpose|Purpose]], [[tags/practices|Practice]], and [[tags/progress|Progress]], so that this can be seen and understood independently by anyone in the [[tags/networks|network]].

This [[tags/transparency|transparency]] allows for decentralized [[tags/coordination|coordination]] across the network. At any point in time the whole of the [[tags/governance|governance]] and operational structure (all of its entities and [[tags/agreements|agreements]]) can be seen and understood. This allows the network to manifest as a coherent whole, while allowing for autonomy for the entities that make it up.
