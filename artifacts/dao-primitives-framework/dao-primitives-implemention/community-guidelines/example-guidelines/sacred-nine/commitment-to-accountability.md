## What This Is

This document describes how we commit to interact with each other in Sacred Nine. These commitments are mutual (we all hold ourselves to them) and negotiable (they evolve as we learn). When disagreements about these commitments arise, we use our Conflict Response Plan.

## Our Commitments

**Communication:**

- **We commit to assuming good intent while naming impact**. When someone's actions affect us negatively, we approach them believing they didn't mean harm while still being honest about how it affected us.
- **We commit to asking clarifying questions before making assumptions**. When we're confused or concerned about someone's words or actions, we ask them directly what they meant rather than filling in the blanks ourselves.
- **We commit to personal responsibility in our interactions.** We respect stated boundaries, maintain appropriate conduct in our communications, and take ownership of our emotional reactions rather than expecting others to manage them for us.

**Conflict:**

- **We commit to addressing tensions directly and early**. When something bothers us, we bring it up sooner rather than letting it build.
- **We commit to participating in the Conflict Response Plan when needed**. When direct conversation doesn't resolve things, we engage with mediation or other processes.
- **We commit to respecting others' conflict processes.** When conflicts arise, we don't insert ourselves unless we're directly affected or asked to help. If we do get involved, we follow our Conflict Response Plan rather than taking matters into our own hands.

[Add additional categories and commitments as needed]

Breaching a commitment isn't shameful -- it's information that helps us learn and adjust.
