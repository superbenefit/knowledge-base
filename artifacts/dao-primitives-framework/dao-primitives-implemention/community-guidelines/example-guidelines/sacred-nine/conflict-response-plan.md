## What This Is

This plan describes how we address conflicts that arise from breaches of our Commitment to Accountability. It provides a structured process for working through disagreements.

**Note:** This plan is not for Code of Conduct violations, which result in immediate removal.

## Our Process

We use a five-step process. Steps 1, 2, and 5 are mandatory. Steps 3 and 4 are optional.

### Step 1: Conflict Recognition

When you notice a breach of our commitments, acknowledge it and decide if you have capacity to engage. Raise the issue with curiosity, focusing on specific behaviors. Ask: "Is this a pattern? Are structures contributing?"

**How to raise a conflict in our community:** [Specify - e.g., "Contact the person directly, or reach out to [role/person] if you need support"]

### Step 2: Interpersonal Discourse

The people involved communicate directly to understand each other and explore needs. Share impact, listen to understand, and approach with willingness to learn.

**Accessibility:** We accommodate different communication needs. You can request written exchanges, processing time, or support people present.

**If resolved:** Document any agreements and proceed to Step 5.
**If not resolved:** Proceed to Step 3.

### Step 3: Mediation (optional)

A neutral third party helps facilitate the conversation.

**Our mediators:** [List names/roles of people who can serve as mediators, or describe the process for selecting one]

**How to request mediation:** [Specify process - e.g., "Contact [person/email] or use [form/system]"]

**If resolved:** Proceed to Step 5.
**If not resolved:** Proceed to Step 4.

### Step 4: Arbitration (optional)

A trusted third party makes a binding decision that all parties commit to accepting.

**Our arbitrators:** [List names/roles of people who can serve as arbitrators, or describe the process for selecting one]

**How to request arbitration:** [Specify process]

**After arbitration:** Proceed to Step 5.

### Step 5: Resolution

Document agreements about future behavior, establish follow-up plans, and extract learnings for the community.

**Follow-up:** We check in [specify timeframe - e.g., "after 2 weeks, then 1 month"] to ensure agreements are honored.

## Power Dynamics

We recognize that power imbalances affect conflicts. Those with more structural power should create space for others to speak freely and acknowledge how power affects the dynamic.
