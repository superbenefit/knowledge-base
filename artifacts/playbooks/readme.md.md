# Playbooks Directory: Actionable Guides for Organizational Success

This directory contains in-progress work on playbooks—actionable guides that combine organizational patterns and primitives into comprehensive, practical resources.  Playbooks are designed to help individuals and organizations implement effective strategies and solutions for various challenges.


## What is a Playbook?

A playbook is a living document that provides step-by-step guidance for achieving specific organizational goals.  Unlike static documentation, playbooks are designed to evolve and adapt as organizations learn and grow.  They bring together technical details, governance frameworks, and community insights into clear, actionable steps.

##  Using the Playbook Library

### Querying Playbooks

Playbooks can be queried in a dataview query like this:
```
LIST description
WHERE 
    type AND
    (
        contains(type, "playbook") OR
        (type = "playbook")
    ) AND
    !contains(file.path, "tools/") AND
    !contains(file.path, "drafts/")
```

An example of this pattern in a dataviewjs query would be:
```
dv.list(
    dv.pages()
        .where(p => 
            (Array.isArray(p.type) 
                ? p.type.some(t => t.includes("playbook")) 
                : p.type?.includes("playbook")) &&
            !p.file.path.includes("tools/") &&
            !p.file.path.includes("drafts/")
        )
        .map(p => p.file.name)
);
```

%% Here is the bare query for fileclass field values:
```javascript
dv.pages()
    .where(p => 
        (Array.isArray(p.type) ? p.type.some(t => t.includes("playbook")) : p.type?.includes("playbook")) &&
        !p.file.path.includes("tools/") &&
        !p.file.path.includes("drafts/")
    )
    .map(p => p.file.name);
```
 %%

## Contributing to the Playbook Library

We welcome contributions that help our playbooks grow and evolve.  If you have experience implementing a successful strategy or solution, consider documenting it as a playbook.  To contribute:

1. **Create a Draft:** Start by creating a new file in the `/drafts/` directory.
2. **Follow the [Template](tools/templates/Playbook%20Template.md):** Use the appropriate template from `/tools/templates/` to ensure consistency.
3. **Document Thoroughly:**  Provide clear, step-by-step instructions, implementation details, and relevant examples.
4. **Submit for Review:** Once your draft is complete, submit it for community review and feedback.

### Using the [Playbook Template](tools/templates/Playbook%20Template.md) 

The [playbook template](tools/templates/Playbook%20Template.md) can be used to create a pre-populated Obsidian note for playbooks.

### Assembling Playbooks

You can use these instructions to assemble a playbook based on the provided template, one section at a time. This is a suggested starting place only, so please check with your team to determine the appropriate workflow for your playbook.

**1. Define the Playbook's Purpose and Scope:**

Begin by clearly articulating the playbook's purpose. What problem does it solve? For whom? What are the specific goals the playbook aims to achieve? Define the scope—what is included and, crucially, what is _excluded_. This prevents the playbook from becoming unwieldy and ensures focus. Consider the target audience's needs and technical expertise.

**2. Identify and Select Relevant Patterns and Primitives:**

Based on the playbook's purpose, identify the relevant patterns and primitives that will form its core components. Research existing patterns and primitives, selecting those that best address the specific challenges and opportunities within the playbook's scope. Justify your choices, explaining why each pattern or primitive was selected and how it contributes to the overall solution.

**3. Develop the Context and Orientation Section:**

This section sets the stage for the entire playbook. It should provide readers with everything they need to determine if the playbook is relevant to their needs. Include:

- **Problem Space:** Clearly define the challenges and opportunities the playbook addresses.
    
- **Target Audience:** Describe the intended users, their roles, and their level of technical expertise.
    
- **Use Cases:** Provide concrete examples of how the playbook can be applied in different scenarios.
    
- **Prerequisites:** Specify any required knowledge, resources, or organizational conditions.
    
- **Key Terms:** Define any domain-specific terminology, linking to relevant definitions or glossaries.
    
- **Core Principles:** Outline the fundamental principles that guide the playbook's approach and pattern selection.
    

**4. Structure the Playbook's Core Sections:**

Organize the playbook's content logically, guiding the reader through the implementation process. Consider these sections:

- **Understanding Patterns in Context:** Briefly explain how the selected patterns address the problem space.
    
- **Core Pattern Set:** Provide an overview of the chosen patterns, explaining why they were selected and how they work together.
    
- **Pattern Interactions:** Detail how the patterns interact, including dependencies, synergies, potential conflicts, and synergistic effects.
    
- **Implementation Guide:** Provide step-by-step instructions for implementing the solution, including technical specifications, resource requirements, and risk management strategies. Break this down into phases (e.g., initial setup, ongoing maintenance).
    
- **Case Studies & Examples:** Include real-world examples of successful implementations, highlighting adaptations, results, and lessons learned.
    

**5. Foster Community Engagement:**

Design the playbook to be a living document. Include a section on how users can contribute improvements, access support resources, and participate in the playbook's ongoing development. This fosters a sense of community ownership and ensures the playbook remains relevant and useful.

**6. Refine and Iterate:**

Once a draft is complete, gather feedback from potential users. Refine the playbook based on this feedback, ensuring clarity, accuracy, and usability. Playbooks should evolve over time, adapting to new information and user experiences.
