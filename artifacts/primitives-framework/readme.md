*This directory helps bridge theory and practice by showing how organizational patterns and implementation tools apply in different organizational contexts.*

This directory houses the Primitives Framework - a systematic approach to designing decentralized organizations as purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams through three lifecycle stages: discovering social groups and their state, defining trust zones and composing governance structures, and creating organizational graphs while deploying primitives for specific context and scale.

## Key Principles

**Flexible yet Coherent**: Patterns can be combined in various ways while maintaining interoperability and coherent structures.

**Context-Appropriate**: Different phases and scales require different tools, practices, and governance mechanisms.

**Transparent Coordination**: Clear documentation of group state (Purpose, Practice, Progress) enables decentralized coordination without hierarchical oversight.

**Permissionless Innovation**: Design for the freedom to work autonomously, attract collaborators, and propose to the broader network.

**Multi-Scale Governance**: Organizations operate at multiple scales simultaneously - design coordination mechanisms appropriate to each scale.

### Framework Applications

**New Organization Design** - Start from scratch with appropriate patterns for your phase and scale

**Existing Organization Evolution** - Incrementally transition toward more decentralized models

**Inter-Organizational Coordination** - Design collaborative structures between multiple organizations or DAOs

**Network Governance** - Establish coordination systems for purpose-aligned networks

### Other Frameworks

While this framework is non-technical, it is also meant to lay practical groundwork for adoption of other, more technical frameworks and tools.

### Schemas in Use

You don't need any particular schemas to use the Primitives Framework. Many useful schemas exist already to help you formalize your designs and standardize your data. We've found these ones useful when building this framework:

For the purpose of organizing the contents of this framework in the knowledge garden, we use several templates and fileclasses available in our Obsidian and Quartz implementations. You can learn more about these in the [tools directory readme file](tools/readme.md).
