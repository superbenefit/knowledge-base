*This directory helps bridge theory and practice by showing how organizational patterns and implementation tools apply in different organizational contexts.*

This directory houses the Primitives Framework - a systematic approach to designing decentralized organizations as purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams. The framework guides you through three phases: discovering your trust zones, designing your organizational graph through voluntary agreements, and implementing appropriate primitives for your context and scale.

## Key Principles

**Flexible yet Coherent**: Patterns can be combined in various ways while maintaining interoperability and coherent structures.

**Context-Appropriate**: Different phases and scales require different tools, practices, and governance mechanisms.

**Transparent Coordination**: Clear documentation of group state (Purpose, Practice, Progress) enables decentralized coordination without hierarchical oversight.

**Permissionless Innovation**: Design for the freedom to work autonomously, attract collaborators, and propose to the broader network.

**Multi-Scale Governance**: Organizations operate at multiple scales simultaneously - design coordination mechanisms appropriate to each scale.

### Framework Applications

**New Organization Design** - Start from scratch with appropriate patterns for your phase and scale

**Existing Organization Evolution** - Incrementally transition toward more decentralized models

**Inter-Organizational Coordination** - Design collaborative structures between multiple organizations or DAOs

**Network Governance** - Establish coordination systems for purpose-aligned networks
