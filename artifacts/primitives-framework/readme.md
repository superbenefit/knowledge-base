# Primitives Framework

This directory houses the Primitives Framework - a systematic approach to designing decentralized organizations as purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams. The framework guides you through phases and scales of organizational development while providing fundamental building blocks for governance and operational design.

## Start Here

**New to the framework?** Read [Framework Concepts](primitives-framework-concepts.md) to understand core ideas
**Ready to design?** See [Group Facilitation Guide](group-facilitation.md) for the Discovery → Design → Implementation process
**Looking for patterns?** Browse the [tags directory](../../tags/) for all organizational patterns and concepts

**Quick links:** [DAOs](../../tags/daos.md) · [Cells](../../tags/cells.md) · [Roles](../../tags/roles.md) · [Tasks](../../tags/tasks.md)

## Understanding Organizational Context

The framework provides two complementary tools for organizational design:

### 1. Dimensional Lenses (Assessment Tools)

How to understand where your organization is:

* **[Phase](group-phase/index.md):** The developmental stage your group is in - Conversation, Formation, Organization, Iteration, or Completion. Different phases need different tools and practices.

* **[Scale](group-scale/index.md):** The size and complexity of your group - Collaboration (<10), Coordination (10-150), Constituency (100s+), or Network (inter-organizational). Different scales require different coordination strategies.

* **[State](../../tags/group-state.md):** Documentation of Purpose, Practice, and Progress that enables transparent coordination. Understanding and documenting your organizational state is crucial for decentralized operations.

### 2. Organizational Patterns (Building Blocks)

What to build with:

* **Organizational Patterns:** The four fundamental structures - [DAOs](../../tags/daos.md), [Cells](../../tags/cells.md), [Roles](../../tags/roles.md), and [Tasks](../../tags/tasks.md) - that can be combined to create tailored governance and operational systems. These are organizational patterns (what you design), distinct from technical primitives (how you implement using smart contracts, tokens, governance protocols). See [tags/](../../tags/) for all patterns.

## Three-Phase Process

The framework guides you through Discovery → Design → Implementation:

1. **Discovery:** Assess your group's current phase, scale, and state. Understand stakeholder needs and organizational context.
2. **Design:** Select appropriate organizational patterns (DAOs, Cells, Roles, Tasks) and governance approaches based on discovery insights.
3. **Implementation:** Deploy technical infrastructure using governance protocols, smart contracts, and coordination tools.

See the [Group Facilitation Guide](group-facilitation.md) for detailed guidance on this process.
