## Purpose of this Guide

Navigate three phases to support groups in developing decentralized [governance](tags/governance.md) and operational structures: assess group context, design appropriate governance systems, and implement those systems using the Primitives Framework.

> **Quick Navigation**: **First time facilitating?** Start with [Discovery](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/index.md) · **Have discovery report already?** Jump to [Design](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/design/index.md) · **Design approved, need to implement?** [Implementation](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/implementation/index.md)

---

## Facilitation Process

Work through three phases in the facilitation flow:

1. **[Discover](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/index.md)** - Assess group context and understand the starting state. Produce a discovery report.
2. **[Design](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/design/index.md)** - Compose [governance](tags/governance.md) and operational structure using organizational patterns. Produce a governance design proposal.
3. **[Implement](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/implementation/index.md)** - Deploy the design using structured processes from implementation guides.

> **Note**: Process complexity varies by group [scale](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-scale/index.md) and [phase](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-phase/index.md). A single cell requires less facilitation than a multi-stakeholder DAO network.

### Key Facilitation Steps

1. **Assess Context**: Identify the group's current phase, scale, and state
2. **Identify Needs**: Determine the most pressing challenges and opportunities
3. **Select Patterns**: Choose appropriate organizational patterns from the [Pattern Library](notes/dao-primitives/implementation/patterns/index.md)
4. **Implement Solutions**: Adapt and apply patterns to the specific context
5. **Evolve & Iterate**: Continuously refine the approach based on feedback
