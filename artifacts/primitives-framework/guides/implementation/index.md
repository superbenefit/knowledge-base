### 1. Design Implementation Steps

Create a clear roadmap for implementing the [governance](tags/governance.md) system. Account for dynamic group development—complex governance systems evolve rather than launching fully formed.

#### Group-Phase Considerations

Align implementation steps with the group's current [phase](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-phase/index.md):

- **Conversation Phase**: Informal gathering of ideas and intentions
- **Formation Phase**: Basic [agreements](tags/agreements.md) and initial structures
- **Organization Phase**: Formalized systems and processes
- **Iteration Phase**: Ongoing operations and evolution
- **Completion Phase**: Winding down unneeded groups

For larger, more complex groups, different parts of the [governance](tags/governance.md) and operational structure may exist at different phases simultaneously as the system evolves. Single groups typically exist within one phase at a time, allowing for more straightforward implementation sequencing.

#### Group-Scale Integration

Ensure the implementation plan addresses governance entities, [agreements](tags/agreements.md), tools, and [practices](tags/practices.md) appropriate to current and projected group [scales](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-scale/index.md). Complex groups have multiple scales represented across their governance structure, with smaller scale groups nested within larger structures. Account for scale evolution as groups grow and change over time.

#### Group-State Anchoring

Anchor the development of the [governance](tags/governance.md) system to the evolution of [group-state](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/design/group-state.md) documentation for each entity in the system. For DAO development, begin with sketching a high-level version appropriate to the formation phase. This provides essential infrastructure like proposal processes and [treasury](tags/treasury.md) management that enable [community](tags/community.md) stakeholders to provide mandates for ongoing governance development and [resource](tags/resources.md) allocation.

For single teams, implementing governance proceeds more rapidly. If requirements are clear, produce a completed group-state quickly, allowing teams to move from formation through organization to iteration phase in short timeframes.

#### Implementation Guides

Several implementation guides provide documented processes for specific [governance](tags/governance.md) systems. If the chosen governance approach and pattern set maps to available guides, they can be followed for detailed implementation guidance:

- **Community Governance**: For constituency-scale governance
- **Operational Governance**: For coordination-scale operations
- **Multi-Stakeholder Governance**: For inter-network partnerships

### 2. Implementation Plan Development

Produce a comprehensive plan for implementing the [governance](tags/governance.md) and operational system, including:

- **Implementation Phases**: Sequenced stages of system development
- **Timelines**: Realistic schedules for each phase and milestone
- **Budget Requirements**: [Resource](tags/resources.md) needs for implementation activities
- **Implementation Team**: Who will execute the work and their [responsibilities](tags/responsibilities.md)

### 3. Implementation Proposal

The implementation plan itself requires approval through appropriate [governance](tags/governance.md) mechanisms. For small groups with dedicated [resources](tags/resources.md), this can be an internal decision reflected in group state documentation. For larger groups with [community](tags/community.md) membership, this should follow established or new community proposal processes to ensure proper authorization and resource allocation.
