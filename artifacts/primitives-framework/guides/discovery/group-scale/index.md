Identify which scale your organization operates at to design appropriate coordination mechanisms. Human systems function differently at different scales—collaboration dynamics in a 5-person team differ fundamentally from coordination across 50 teams or governance spanning thousands of stakeholders.

## Four Group Scales

Each scale has distinct characteristics, challenges, and best [practices](tags/practices.md):

- [Collaboration Scale](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-scale/collaboration-scale.md) - Sub-10 people, direct relationships
- [Coordination Scale](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-scale/coordination-scale.md) - 10-150 people, multiple teams
- [Constituency Scale](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-scale/constituency-scale.md) - 100s+, broad stakeholder participation
- [Network Scale](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-scale/network-scale.md) - Interconnected organizations

> **Note**: Design decentralized [networks](tags/networks.md) for multiple scales simultaneously. Different [groups](tags/groups.md) operate as autonomous entities while [coordinating](tags/coordination.md) together to create collective intelligence.

## Collaboration Scale

[Collaboration scale](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-scale/collaboration-scale.md) represents the smallest and most fundamental level of [group](tags/groups.md) organization. It is characterized by direct, face-to-face interaction among a small number of individuals (generally under 10) working together towards a shared [goal](tags/purpose.md). Effective collaboration at this scale relies on strong interpersonal relationships, clear communication, and shared understanding.

## Coordination Scale

[Coordination scale](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-scale/coordination-scale.md) involves multiple teams or smaller [groups](tags/groups.md) working together towards a shared [goal](tags/purpose.md), requiring more sophisticated [coordination](tags/coordination.md) mechanisms and communication strategies. This scale typically ranges from 10 to 150 individuals, although this can vary depending on the complexity of the task and the effectiveness of coordination mechanisms.

## Constituency Scale

[Constituency scale](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-scale/constituency-scale.md) encompasses a large and diverse group of stakeholders who share a common interest or benefit from the organization's activities. Unlike smaller scales, this scale emphasizes participation, representation, and collective [decision-making](tags/decisions.md) across a wider [community](tags/community.md).

## Network Scale

[Network scale](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-scale/network-scale.md) represents the largest and most complex level of [group](tags/groups.md) organization, encompassing a system of interconnected organizations or [groups](tags/groups.md) (constituencies) working together towards shared or complementary [goals](tags/purpose.md). This scale is characterized by high levels of interdependence, complex communication flows, and the need for robust mechanisms for [coordination](tags/coordination.md) and [governance](tags/governance.md) across multiple entities.
