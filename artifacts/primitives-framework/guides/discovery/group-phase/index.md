Identify your group's developmental phase to select appropriate tools, structures, and constraints. Groups evolve through distinct phases, each demanding unique approaches that balance autonomy with structure throughout the lifecycle.

## Five Group Phases

Use these phases to map development of teams/Cells within DAO networks or DAOs themselves:

**Phase determines structure**: Early-phase groups exploring ideas need minimal structure (basic communication channels). Mature groups with significant responsibilities require robust organizational frameworks for safe, transparent execution.

**Phase signals trust**: Network participants use phase identification to assess what organizational standards a group meets for engagement, resource allocation, and collaboration.

> **Note**: Implementation varies based on network nature and [values](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-values.md). Permissionless networks may impose minimal early-phase requirements; others establish specific phase criteria. Progression speed varies—working groups may move through all phases in days, while DAOs may take a year from initial conversations to formal onchain structures.

The five group phases are:

- [Conversation Phase](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-phase/conversation-phase.md) - Ideation & Discovery
- [Formation Phase](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-phase/formation-phase.md) - Planning & Design
- [Organization Phase](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-phase/organization-phase.md) - Implementation
- [Iteration Phase](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-phase/iteration-phase.md) - Execution & Evolution
- [Completion Phase](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-phase/completion-phase.md) - Releasing & Returning

**1. [Conversation/Ideation Phase:](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-phase/conversation-phase.md):** This initial phase focuses on open exploration and idea generation. It's a period of brainstorming, sharing perspectives, and identifying potential synergies _before_ formal structures or processes are established. The primary goal is to establish a shared vision and understanding, laying the groundwork for future phases. _Key characteristics_ include shared vision formation, relationship building, and informal processes. This Phase often culminates with a discovery report of some kind that outlines the ideas and opportunities that this phase has explored and recommended next steps

**2. [Formation Phase](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-phase/formation-phase.md):** The Formation Phase represents the critical transition from open exploration to structured commitment within decentralized networks. Following the ideation and relationship-building of the [Conversation Phase](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-phase/conversation-phase.md), groups in Formation begin establishing clear boundaries, formalizing agreements, and designing the structure needed for coordinated action. This phase transforms emerging potential into concrete design creating the foundation for functional structure to be implemented, and often culminates with a community proposal to formally establish the group's structure. _Key characteristics_, proposal development, initial state documentation and initial execution.

**3. [Organization Phase](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-phase/organization-phase.md):** The Organization Phase builds on the Formation Phase, transitioning from a basic framework to a fully established, formal structure with defined processes and governance mechanisms. This phase is characterized by the implementation of clear systems, procedures, and decision-making frameworks designed in the Formation phase. The primary goal is to create a sustainable and scalable organizational structure. _Key Characteristics_ include governance implementation, operational infrastructure, and external interface mechanisms. This phase culminates with the full implementation of the governance and operational design outlined in its [group-state](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/design/group-state.md) documentation.

**4. [Iteration Phase](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-phase/iteration-phase.md):** The Iteration Phase represents the mature group phase where groups transition from establishing their structures and processes in the [organization phase](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-phase/organization-phase.md) to focused execution on their purpose and goals. In this phase, a group leverages its fully implemented operational capabilities and governance systems to deliver maximum value and impact for itself and for the networks that it participates in. The emphasis shifts from internal development to effective delivery, with coordination becoming a key mechanism for accessing necessary resources, capabilities, and support from the broader network or ecosystem.

**5. [Completion Phase](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-phase/completion-phase.md):**
This final phase focuses on the intentional conclusion of groups that have fulfilled their purpose or are no longer effectively serving the network. The primary goal is to properly redistribute resources, preserve valuable knowledge, and formally close operations. _Key characteristics_ include documenting learnings, transferring responsibilities, distributing remaining funds, and clear communication about the closure. Without effective completion processes, networks accumulate "organizational debt" as outdated structures persist, undermining the flexibility and efficiency that DAOs aim to achieve.
