description: Using the Primitives Framework in your discovery process
---

The discovery phase of the Primitives Framework focuses on understanding your organizational context—mapping the distinct social groups (trust zones) where collaboration occurs, their developmental stage and scale, and the shared (or divergent) perspectives on purpose and practice. This guide provides structured approaches to group sense-making and contextual assessment that can enhance your existing discovery processes or serve as a standalone methodology if you're building one from scratch.

## Group Sense Making: The Foundation of Discovery

The discovery process begins with a fundamental recognition: most [groups](tags/groups.md), whether they're nascent DAOs, established teams, or emerging [networks](tags/networks.md), operate with surprisingly little shared understanding of their own context. While groups often form around compelling high-level ideas or shared visions, the actual alignment around concrete intentions, operational realities, and stakeholder needs frequently remains unexplored territory.

Group sense making serves as the cornerstone of effective [governance](tags/governance.md) design because it transforms individual perspectives into collective intelligence. This process is particularly crucial for decentralized organizations where traditional hierarchical structures cannot rely on top-down clarity to resolve ambiguity. Instead, the group itself must become the primary mechanism for developing shared understanding and surfacing areas of misalignment that could undermine future governance structures.

The sense making process serves two interconnected purposes:

- **Collective Discovery**: Enables the group to discover its own context collaboratively, which is essential because governance systems built on assumed consensus often fail to meet stakeholder needs
- **Ongoing Coherence**: Provides an artifact that group members can use to build on the group's organizational development, such as evolving the governance structure and developing their impact model

For larger groups and those encompassing multiple stakeholder contexts, the sense making process becomes even more involved. These environments contain diverse perspectives, competing incentives, and varying definitions of success that must be surfaced and integrated before effective [governance](tags/governance.md) can be designed.

## Mapping Organizational Context and Stakeholder Landscapes

The heart of group sense making involves systematically mapping the current organizational context, beginning with stakeholder perspectives on vision, [purpose](tags/purpose.md), and impact goals. This mapping process reveals not just what stakeholders want the group to achieve, but how they understand the group's role within larger systems and what success looks like from their vantage point.

### Process Steps by Group Scale:

**For Single Teams/Small Groups:**

1. Conduct intensive workshop sessions with structured dialogue
2. Surface individual mental models and assumptions
3. Identify areas of alignment and divergence collaboratively
4. Document shared understanding and remaining tensions

**For [Community](tags/community.md) Networks/Multi-Stakeholder Groups:**

1. Gather insights from different stakeholder groups separately
2. Synthesize and share insights back to the wider [community](tags/community.md)
3. Iterate through multiple rounds of sense making
4. Continue until authentic shared understanding emerges (not just superficial agreement)

The sense making process often reveals early patterns that become crucial for design:

- **Stakeholder Relationships**: Who needs to coordinate with whom and how
- **Value Flows**: How value creation and exchange naturally occurs within the [network](tags/networks.md)
- **Power Dynamics**: Where influence and [decision-making](tags/decisions.md) authority currently reside
- **Resource Dependencies**: What the group needs to function and where those [resources](tags/resources.md) come from

Understanding these emergent patterns provides crucial input for the design phase, as [governance](tags/governance.md) structures must align with and support the natural dynamics of the network rather than imposing artificial constraints.

Throughout this process, facilitators can draw upon various sense making tools and methodologies available in the [sense-making-facilitation-tools](notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/sense-making-facilitation-tools.md) for specific facilitation needs.

## Producing Discovery Outputs: Reports and Proposals

The discovery phase culminates in concrete outputs that capture insights and provide clear direction for next steps. These outputs serve as both culmination and foundation—capturing the collective intelligence generated through sense making while establishing the legitimacy and direction needed for [governance](tags/governance.md) design.

### 1. Report your Discovery Findings

If you're integrating the Primitives Framework into an existing discovery process, the key addition is documenting group state—a structured way to capture organizational context for each trust zone you've identified. This provides the foundation needed for effective design and implementation phases.

For groups building a discovery process from scratch, a comprehensive discovery report typically includes:

- **Shared Understanding**: Clear articulation of agreed-upon [purpose](tags/purpose.md) and high-level goals
- **Divergent Perspectives**: Honest acknowledgment of areas where different viewpoints persist
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Overview of key participants, their interests, and relationship patterns
- **Value Flow Insights**: Early understanding of how value creation and exchange occurs
- **Group State Documentation**: Organizational context for identified trust zones
- **Areas for Further Exploration**: Recognition of questions requiring continued attention

This report becomes a foundational artifact that establishes legitimacy for the [governance](tags/governance.md) design process and provides accountability for how stakeholder input shaped the emerging direction. The depth and formality should match your group's phase and complexity—a small team might need only a lightweight document, while multi-stakeholder networks benefit from comprehensive synthesis.

### 2. (Optional) Validate your Group State

Depending on your context, you may need to validate your documented group state through your existing governance processes—or validation may be unnecessary if the discovery work already involved appropriate stakeholders. The goal is ensuring legitimate consensus around the documented state so it can serve as a reliable foundation for design work.

**How validation works varies widely:**
- **Small autonomous teams** might simply review and confirm the group state document during a team meeting
- **Projects within existing organizations** might submit the state as part of a proposal or planning document for approval
- **Multi-stakeholder initiatives** might use formal governance processes (proposal voting, stakeholder sign-off, board approval)
- **Legal entity formation** might incorporate group state into founding documents or operating agreements

The validation mechanism should match your group's phase, scale, and existing decision-making culture. What matters is that the documented state has appropriate legitimacy for the design work ahead—whether that comes from collaborative creation, formal approval, or simply shared acknowledgment by those involved.

For larger groups moving to the design phase, validation often includes designating a design team with clear accountability mechanisms for how they'll maintain connection with and responsiveness to broader stakeholders throughout the design process.
