description: Using the Primitives Framework in your discovery process

Map your organizational context through group sense-making. Identify the distinct social groups (trust zones) where collaboration occurs, assess their developmental stage and scale, and surface shared or divergent perspectives on purpose and practice. Use these structured approaches to enhance existing discovery processes or build one from scratch.

## Group Sense Making

Transform individual perspectives into collective intelligence through structured sense-making. Most [groups](tags/groups.md)—whether nascent DAOs, established teams, or emerging [networks](tags/networks.md)—operate with limited shared understanding of their own context. Groups form around compelling visions but rarely explore alignment on concrete intentions, operational realities, and stakeholder needs.

Use sense-making to:
- **Discover your context collaboratively**: Build [governance](tags/governance.md) on stakeholder needs rather than assumed consensus
- **Create ongoing coherence**: Produce an artifact for evolving governance structures and impact models

#### Mapping Stakeholder Landscapes



> **Note**: Larger groups and multi-stakeholder contexts require more intensive sense-making to surface diverse perspectives, competing incentives, and varying success definitions before effective [governance](tags/governance.md) can be designed.

## Documenting Organizational Context

Map organizational context systematically, beginning with stakeholder perspectives on vision, [purpose](tags/purpose.md), and impact goals. Identify not just what stakeholders want the group to achieve, but how they understand the group's role within larger systems and their definitions of success.

### Process Steps by Group Scale:

**For Single Teams/Small Groups:**

1. Conduct intensive workshop sessions with structured dialogue
2. Surface individual mental models and assumptions
3. Identify areas of alignment and divergence collaboratively
4. Document shared understanding and remaining tensions

**For [Community](tags/community.md) Networks/Multi-Stakeholder Groups:**

1. Gather insights from different stakeholder groups separately
2. Synthesize and share insights back to the wider [community](tags/community.md)
3. Iterate through multiple rounds of sense making
4. Continue until authentic shared understanding emerges (not just superficial agreement)

Identify early patterns that become crucial for design:

- **Stakeholder Relationships**: Who needs to coordinate with whom and how
- **Value Flows**: How value creation and exchange naturally occurs within the [network](tags/networks.md)
- **Power Dynamics**: Where influence and [decision-making](tags/decisions.md) authority currently reside
- **Resource Dependencies**: What the group needs to function and where those [resources](tags/resources.md) come from

> **Note**: Design [governance](tags/governance.md) structures that align with and support natural network dynamics rather than imposing artificial constraints. Draw upon sense-making tools and methodologies in [sense-making-facilitation-tools](notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/sense-making-facilitation-tools.md) for specific facilitation needs.

## Producing Discovery Outputs

Capture insights and provide clear direction through concrete outputs. These serve as both culmination and foundation—documenting collective intelligence from sense-making while establishing legitimacy for [governance](tags/governance.md) design.

### 1. Report your Discovery Findings

Document group state for each identified trust zone—a structured capture of organizational context. This foundation enables effective design and implementation phases.

**For groups building from scratch**, include:

- **Shared Understanding**: Clear articulation of agreed-upon [purpose](tags/purpose.md) and high-level goals
- **Divergent Perspectives**: Honest acknowledgment of areas where different viewpoints persist
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Overview of key participants, their interests, and relationship patterns
- **Value Flow Insights**: Early understanding of how value creation and exchange occurs
- **Group State Documentation**: Organizational context for identified trust zones
- **Areas for Further Exploration**: Recognition of questions requiring continued attention

This report becomes a foundational artifact that establishes legitimacy for the [governance](tags/governance.md) design process and provides accountability for how stakeholder input shaped the emerging direction. The depth and formality should match your group's phase and complexity—a small team might need only a lightweight document, while multi-stakeholder networks benefit from comprehensive synthesis.

### 2. (Optional) Validate your Group State

Depending on your context, you may need to validate your documented group state through your existing governance processes—or validation may be unnecessary if the discovery work already involved appropriate stakeholders. The goal is ensuring legitimate consensus around the documented state so it can serve as a reliable foundation for design work.

**How validation works varies widely:**
- **Small autonomous teams** might simply review and confirm the group state document during a team meeting
- **Projects within existing organizations** might submit the state as part of a proposal or planning document for approval
- **Multi-stakeholder initiatives** might use formal governance processes (proposal voting, stakeholder sign-off, board approval)
- **Legal entity formation** might incorporate group state into founding documents or operating agreements

The validation mechanism should match your group's phase, scale, and existing decision-making culture. What matters is that the documented state has appropriate legitimacy for the design work ahead—whether that comes from collaborative creation, formal approval, or simply shared acknowledgment by those involved.

For larger groups moving to the design phase, validation often includes designating a design team with clear accountability mechanisms for how they'll maintain connection with and responsiveness to broader stakeholders throughout the design process.
