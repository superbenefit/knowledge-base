Identify the priorities that guide your group's trade-off decisions when navigating tensions between competing qualities. Values clarify which qualities take precedence when groups face inevitable conflicts—balancing inclusion with efficiency, transparency with privacy, autonomy with alignment.

## Values as a Contextual Lens

Use Values alongside [Group Phase](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-phase/index.md) and [Group Scale](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-scale/index.md) to select appropriate organizational patterns and primitives. While Phase and Scale objectively define a group's developmental stage and size, Values signal the unique priorities that make each group a non-fungible social formation within the broader network.

Values help answer: *When we face competing priorities, which quality takes precedence?*

## Common Value Trade-Offs

Groups frequently encounter tensions between desirable qualities. Identify which trade-offs matter most for your context:

### Expediency vs. Participation
**Expediency**: Move quickly, make decisions efficiently, minimize process overhead
**Participation**: Include broad stakeholder input, ensure voices are heard, build legitimacy through involvement

*When to prioritize Expediency*: Small teams in early phases; time-sensitive decisions; operational execution
*When to prioritize Participation*: Multi-stakeholder networks; constitutional decisions; community [governance](tags/governance.md)

### Immutability vs. Adaptability
**Immutability**: Lock in agreements, create stability, resist change
**Adaptability**: Iterate quickly, respond to feedback, evolve practices

*When to prioritize Immutability*: Foundational agreements; legal commitments; long-term resource allocation
*When to prioritize Adaptability*: Experimental phases; rapidly changing environments; learning-focused initiatives

### Determinism vs. Discretion
**Determinism**: Codify rules explicitly, automate execution, reduce ambiguity
**Discretion**: Enable human judgment, maintain flexibility, trust decision-makers

*When to prioritize Determinism*: Treasury management; permissionless access; trustless coordination
*When to prioritize Discretion*: Complex decisions; nuanced situations; relationship-based coordination

### Transparency vs. Privacy
**Transparency**: Make information publicly visible, enable accountability, build trust through openness
**Privacy**: Protect sensitive information, respect confidentiality, maintain strategic advantage

*When to prioritize Transparency*: Public goods funding; [community](tags/community.md) governance; accountability mechanisms
*When to prioritize Privacy*: Competitive environments; personal information; strategic planning

### Autonomy vs. Alignment
**Autonomy**: Enable independent action, reduce coordination overhead, trust local decision-making
**Alignment**: Ensure coherence, maintain shared direction, coordinate across boundaries

*When to prioritize Autonomy*: [Cells](tags/cells.md) at collaboration scale; execution within clear mandates; innovation-focused work
*When to prioritize Alignment*: Network-wide initiatives; resource allocation; [purpose](tags/purpose.md)-critical decisions

## Crafting Value Statements

Express your group's priorities using "even-over" statements that acknowledge both qualities while clarifying precedence.

**Format**: "We value **[Quality A]** *even over* **[Quality B]**"

**Examples**:
- "We value **Participation** even over **Expediency**" — signals commitment to inclusive processes despite slower decision-making
- "We value **Adaptability** even over **Immutability**" — indicates willingness to iterate and evolve practices
- "We value **Transparency** even over **Privacy**" — prioritizes openness and accountability
- "We value **Autonomy** even over **Alignment**" — trusts teams to act independently within broad parameters

> **Important**: "Even-over" statements don't exclude the secondary quality—they clarify priority when tensions arise. Both qualities remain important; the statement guides which takes precedence in conflict.

## Integrating Values into Practice

### During Discovery

Document shared values and divergent perspectives in your discovery report. Surface where stakeholders agree on priorities and where tensions exist.

### During Design

Use values to select organizational patterns and governance approaches. A group valuing Participation over Expediency will choose different decision-making protocols than one prioritizing Expediency.

### During Implementation

Apply values when selecting [primitives](tags/primitives.md)—the technical tools and protocols that enable your designed structure. Values guide choices between:
- Governance protocols (on-chain voting vs. off-chain deliberation)
- Coordination tools (synchronous vs. asynchronous communication)
- Decision-making processes (consensus vs. consent vs. voting)
- Treasury management (multi-sig vs. programmable allocation)

### Documenting in Group State

Record agreed-upon values in your [group state](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/design/group-state.md) documentation under **Practice** (how the group operates and makes decisions). Include:
- Core value statements (even-over format)
- Context for when each value takes priority
- Examples of how values have guided past decisions
- Process for evolving values over time

> **Note**: Values are strategic and cultural. Many groups adopt values-based organizing to facilitate certain cultural norms and social purposes, but struggle when institutional environments enforce contradictory norms through boilerplate agreements or compliance requirements. Decentralized systems enable groups to custody infrastructure within bespoke, smart-contract-enforced systems resistant to these external influences.

## Connection to Other Frameworks

This approach to Values aligns with "Flavors" in [The Blockchain Governance Toolkit](links/The%20Blockchain%20Governance%20Toolkit.md). The Toolkit's Step 1 ("Pick your Flavors") focuses on preferred qualities. The Primitives Framework extends this by:

1. **Adding contextual lenses**: Use Values alongside Phase and Scale for three-dimensional primitive evaluation
2. **Emphasizing trade-offs**: Explicitly acknowledge tensions rather than just preferences
3. **Integrating with group state**: Provide structured documentation approach for ongoing reference

Use both frameworks together: the Toolkit's comprehensive quality exploration complements the Primitives Framework's implementation guidance.

## Evolving Values Over Time

Revisit values as your group develops:
- **Formation → Organization phase**: Formalize implicit values as structures solidify
- **Organization → Iteration phase**: Test whether stated values align with actual practice
- **Scale transitions**: Reassess trade-offs when moving from collaboration to coordination to constituency scale
- **Major decisions**: Use challenging choices to clarify or refine value priorities

Values aren't fixed—they evolve as groups learn what matters most for their specific context and purpose.
