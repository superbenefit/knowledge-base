A framework for building decentralized organizations as purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams.

## What Is This Framework?

The Primitives Framework guides organizations through three essential phases for building decentralized coordination systems:

1. **Discovery** — Identify your trust zones: the distinct social groups where collaboration naturally occurs, and understand their current phase, scale, and values
2. **Design** — Network those trust zones together using voluntary agreements, making relationships explicit through an organizational graph
3. **Implementation** — Choose and implement the appropriate organizing primitives (tools and protocols) for your specific context

This systematic approach addresses a crucial challenge: how can decentralized networks scale while maintaining the responsiveness and adaptability needed for complex, evolving environments? The framework provides both contextual lenses for understanding your organizational reality and practical patterns for building coordination systems that balance efficiency with innovation, autonomy with alignment, and flexibility with coherence.

### Why did we make this?

%% This section should just focus on the theoretical basis and rationale for the primitives framework, and the articles section where readers can dive deeper into our organizing approach. Links to relevant tag pages should be used to help readers understand jargon, etc %%

- to help people understand how to learn about, evaluate and use DAO Primitives. 
- to serve a gap in the web3 education space, around how to practically approach tooling adoption from a social impact and systems change lens.
- to serve as a jumping off point to deeper learning and other helpful tools/frameworks
- a non-prescriptive starting place for exploration, composed of modules which can slot into any project lifecycle.

#### Who Is This For?

%% The content below isn't useful. Zoom out and just state the intended audience using a short paragraph%%

- Groups looking to adopt web3 and other decentralized coordination technologies
- Networks, funders, capacity builders and other institutions looking to experiment with decentralized technologies for systems change.
- 

#### Who is this *not* for?

- Organizations who don't need to adopt decentralized coordination tools
- Organizations with a strong grasp of their group state and established practices for self-organizing onchain.

## Guides %% rename this %%

%% This section should simultaneously serve the dual purposes of: 1.) helping the reader to understand the contents and context of the /primitives-framework/guides directory as it relates to the practical application of the primitives framework and 2.) Conveying enough of the framework itself to give the reader a high-level understanding of how the framework is used and what its value is (such that a reader can tell whether it's even worth clicking on the links to read more) %%

**Want to know more?** Check out the [Conceptual Framework](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/concepts.md) to understand the core ideas, contextual dimensions, and organizational patterns.

The framework guides you through a three-phase process:

%% This "Discovery → Design → Implementation" track is described in the start here to match the current structure of the guides. %%

- Document your organizational context and group state
- Select design patterns and develop your organizational graph
- Implement systems to serve your needs using primitives


%% Reorganize lifecycle steps as anticapture cycles %%

%% Use progressive disclosure here. instead of sub-headings for outcome, output, etc., these heading sections should just be one paragraph each under the appropriate lifecycle phase (design, implementation, etc.). Move extra details to the relevant index page for that directory %%

### Discovery

%% discovery intro %%

- Identify distinct social groups and assess their current phase, scale and values
- Study their organizational context and stakeholder landscape.
- Document shared understanding and divergent perspectives on group state
- Produce (and optionally validate) a discovery report with insights and direction

#### Output: Organizational Context

Any discovery process should include gathering some detailed information on the problem you're trying to solve. Whatever your approach to discovery, we recommend that it includes some documentation on the state of the groups and communities your project will interact with. This is especially useful when creating polycentric governance systems and navigating complex environments.

The discovery phase should produce (alongside any other Discovery outputs needed) some form of [Group State](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/design/group-state.md) to use later in the design and planning stages. Other useful information to collect during discovery includes:

- see [readme](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/readme.md) for more useful discovery parameters

### Implementation

%% This section should help the user choose and implement the appropriate organizing primitives for their scale, phase and values.  %%

- Deploy technical infrastructure (governance protocols, coordination tools)
- Establish operational systems and information flows
- Launch with appropriate formality for current phase
- Iterate and evolve based on feedback and changing context

**Choosing governance approach?** Review the [implementation guides](implementation/) for operational, community, and multi-stakeholder governance.
