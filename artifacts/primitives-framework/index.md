A framework for building decentralized organizations as purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams.

## What Is This Framework?

The Primitives Framework guides organizations through three essential phases for building decentralized coordination systems:

1. **Discovery** — Identify your trust zones: the distinct social groups where collaboration naturally occurs, and understand their current phase, scale, and values
2. **Design** — Network those trust zones together using voluntary agreements, making relationships explicit through an organizational graph
3. **Implementation** — Choose and implement the appropriate organizing primitives (tools and protocols) for your specific context

This systematic approach addresses a crucial challenge: how can decentralized networks scale while maintaining the responsiveness and adaptability needed for complex, evolving environments? The framework provides both contextual lenses for understanding your organizational reality and practical patterns for building coordination systems that balance efficiency with innovation, autonomy with alignment, and flexibility with coherence.

### Why did we make this?

The Primitives Framework emerged from SuperBenefit's practical work helping organizations navigate the transition to decentralized coordination. Traditional organizational models—optimized for industrial production and hierarchical management—excel at efficiency but struggle with the complexity, adaptability, and equitable value distribution that modern challenges demand. 

This framework bridges that gap by providing a systematic approach to tool evaluation and adoption through a social impact and systems change lens. Rather than prescribing specific solutions, it offers modular components that slot into any project lifecycle, helping you understand your organizational context ([phase](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-phase/index.md), [scale](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-scale/index.md), [values](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-values.md)), select appropriate [patterns](tags/primitives.md), and implement [primitives](tags/primitives.md) that serve your needs.

#### Who Is This For?

This framework is designed for organizations at the intersection of social impact and decentralized technology—groups looking to adopt Web3 coordination tools, networks and funders experimenting with decentralized approaches to systems change, and capacity builders supporting communities through governance transitions. It's most valuable for teams navigating the "how" of practical implementation: you understand why decentralization matters, but need systematic guidance for translating purpose into practice.

If your organization already has a strong grasp of its group state and established practices for self-organizing onchain, you may find individual framework components useful as reference material, though the full discovery-through-implementation process may be more structured than you need.

## How to Use This Framework

Three phases mirror how decentralized organizations naturally evolve—from understanding your current reality, to designing your coordination systems, to implementing the tools that support your work.

**New to the framework?** Start with the [Conceptual Framework](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/concepts.md) to understand core ideas, contextual lenses (phase, scale, values), and organizational patterns.

### Discovery

Begin by mapping your organizational context. Identify your [trust zones](https://blog.hatsprotocol.xyz/making-daos-work)—distinct social groups where collaboration naturally occurs. Assess each trust zone's current [phase](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-phase/index.md) and [scale](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-scale/index.md), and document both shared purpose and divergent perspectives on [values](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-values.md). Produce a discovery report that captures stakeholder insights and, optionally, validated [group state](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/design/group-state.md) documentation.

This work is especially valuable for polycentric governance systems and complex multi-stakeholder environments, where surfacing diverse perspectives early prevents misalignment later. See the [Discovery Guide](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/index.md) for detailed facilitation approaches, or use tools like [Gardnr's Trust Zone Builder](https://gardnr.hatsprotocol.xyz/thread/9e147f02-8826-482e-bb5c-5aabbaa5d435) to structure your discovery process.

### Design

Translate your discovery insights into an [organizational graph](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/design/index.md)—a visual representation of how your trust zones connect through voluntary agreements. Evaluate and select [organizational patterns](tags/primitives.md) based on your contextual lenses (phase, scale, values), then compose them into governance and operational structures tailored to your needs.

Your organizational graph makes explicit which entities exist in your network, how authority flows between them, and what agreements govern their relationships. This becomes your blueprint for implementation, whether you're designing a simple single-team structure or a complex multi-stakeholder network. See the [Design Guide](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/design/index.md) for pattern selection frameworks, or explore the [Blockchain Governance Toolkit](links/The%20Blockchain%20Governance%20Toolkit.md) for values-based governance design approaches.

### Implementation

Bring your organizational graph to life by selecting and deploying specific [primitives](tags/primitives.md)—the technical tools, protocols, and practices that enable your designed structure to function. Choose governance protocols (voting systems, treasury management), coordination tools (communication platforms, project management), and operational practices (decision-making processes, resource allocation mechanisms) appropriate for your phase and scale.

Common governance patterns include [operational governance](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/implementation/implementation-guide-operational-governance.md) (day-to-day execution), [community governance](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/implementation/implementation-guide-community-governance.md) (constituency-scale decision-making), and [multi-stakeholder governance](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/implementation/implementation-guide-multi-stakeholder-governance.md) (balancing diverse interests). Launch with appropriate formality for your current phase, then iterate based on feedback and evolving context. See the [implementation guides](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/implementation/) and [case studies](artifacts/primitives-framework/studies/) for specific examples.
