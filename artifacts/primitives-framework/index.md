A framework for building decentralized organizations as purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams.

## What Is This Framework?

The Primitives Framework is a collection of articles, guides and reference materials to help you effectively adopt decentralized coordination tooling in your team, organization or network:

- [Published Articles](artifacts/primitives-framework/articles/index.md) to help you understand our organizing philosophy, how we work at SuperBenefit, and our approach to designing this framework
- [Informative Guides](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/index.md) to help you identify your social groupings, design trust zones and organizational structure, then implement the tools, rules and practices you need to fulfill your purpose.
- [Case Studies](artifacts/primitives-framework/studies/index.md) and reference material to help you understand how this framework can be used in practice, and evaluate the outcomes produced by others who've used it before.



### Who Is This Framework For?

This framework is designed for organizations at the intersection of social impact and decentralized technology; groups looking to adopt Web3 coordination tools, networks and funders experimenting with decentralized approaches to systems change, and capacity builders supporting communities through governance transitions. It's most valuable for teams navigating the "how" of practical implementation: you understand why decentralization matters, but need systematic guidance for translating purpose into practice.

If your organization already has a strong grasp of its group state and established practices for self-organizing onchain, you may find individual framework components useful as reference material, though the full discovery-through-implementation process may be more structured than you need.

### Why Did We Make This Framework?

The Primitives Framework emerged from SuperBenefit's practical work organizing ourselves and helping organizations navigate the transition to decentralized coordination. Our goal at SuperBenefit is to research and advocate for the effective adoption of emerging, decentralized technologies in pursuit of pro-social systems transformation. Following our commitment to "bridging old into better", we recognize that most people and organizations who share our commitment to social impact are *offchain*, and require practical, high-level guidance for adopting decentralized coordination tools.

We created this framework to help SuperBenefit contributors, its partners and collaborators, and the general public to approach decentralized tech adoption. We hope to provide both a practical framework for tool selection and adoption, and a jumping-off point to explore other the frameworks, tools, practices and organizing patterns which you'll find in the knowledge commons.

## How to Use This Framework

==Three phases mirror how decentralized organizations naturally evolve—from understanding your current reality, to designing your coordination systems, to implementing the tools that support your work.==

==This systematic approach addresses a crucial challenge: how can decentralized networks scale while maintaining the responsiveness and adaptability needed for complex, evolving environments? Contextual lenses help you understand your organizational reality, while practical patterns enable you to build coordination systems that balance efficiency with innovation, autonomy with alignment, and flexibility with coherence.==

The Primitives Framework is just one of many approaches to adopting decentralized technology. We hope that you'll explore other approaches as well, and have deliberately structured this framework with clear parallels to other common decentralized governance frameworks so that you can deviate or dive deeper at any step along the way.

## Guides

==Access framework resources organized by three lifecycle stages for building decentralized coordination systems:==

1. **Discovery** — Identify social groups where collaboration naturally occurs, and discover their current organizational context.
2. **Design** — Define trust zones that social groups occupy via delegation, select organizational patterns, and compose governance and operational structures
3. **Implementation** — Create the organizational graph by networking trust zones together, then deploy patterns and primitives for your specific context

**New to the framework?** Start with the [Conceptual Framework](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/concepts.md) to understand core ideas, contextual lenses (phase, scale, values), and organizational patterns.

#### Discovery

Begin by mapping your organizational context. Identify distinct social groups where collaboration naturally occurs. Assess each group's current [phase](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-phase/index.md), [scale](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-scale/index.md), and [values](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/group-values.md). Document both shared purpose and divergent perspectives. Produce a discovery report that captures stakeholder insights and, optionally, validated [group state](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/design/group-state.md) documentation.

This work is especially valuable for polycentric governance systems and complex multi-stakeholder environments, where surfacing diverse perspectives early prevents misalignment later. See the [Discovery Guide](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/discovery/index.md) for detailed facilitation approaches, or use tools like [Gardnr's Trust Zone Builder](https://gardnr.hatsprotocol.xyz/thread/9e147f02-8826-482e-bb5c-5aabbaa5d435) to structure your discovery process.

#### Design

Define [trust zones](https://blog.hatsprotocol.xyz/making-daos-work) that your discovered social groups occupy within the organization. Recognize that social groups and trust zones aren't one-to-one—groups may occupy multiple trust zones, and trust zones may include non-group agents. Evaluate and select [organizational patterns](tags/primitives.md) based on your contextual lenses (phase, scale, values), then compose them into governance and operational structures tailored to your needs.

See the [Design Guide](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/design/index.md) for pattern selection frameworks and trust zone definition approaches, or explore the [Blockchain Governance Toolkit](links/The%20Blockchain%20Governance%20Toolkit.md) for values-based governance design.

#### Implementation

==Create your organizational graph by networking trust zones together with their organizational structure and occupying agents. This graph makes explicit which entities exist in your network, how authority flows between them, and what agreements govern their relationships. Then deploy specific patterns and [primitives](tags/primitives.md)—the technical tools, protocols, and practices—for each trust zone.==

Select governance protocols (voting systems, treasury management), coordination tools (communication platforms, project management), and operational practices (decision-making processes, resource allocation mechanisms) appropriate for your phase and scale. Common governance patterns include [operational governance](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/implementation/implementation-guide-operational-governance.md) (day-to-day execution), [community governance](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/implementation/implementation-guide-community-governance.md) (constituency-scale decision-making), and [multi-stakeholder governance](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/implementation/implementation-guide-multi-stakeholder-governance.md) (balancing diverse interests). Launch with appropriate formality for your current phase, then iterate based on feedback and evolving context. See the [implementation guides](artifacts/primitives-framework/guides/implementation/) and [case studies](artifacts/primitives-framework/studies/) for specific examples.
