A systematic approach to designing decentralized organizations as purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams.

## What Is This Framework?

The Primitives Framework helps organizations design coordination systems that balance efficiency with innovation, autonomy with alignment, and flexibility with coherence. It provides **organizational patterns** (structural building blocks) and **dimensional lenses** (assessment tools) that can be combined to create governance and operational systems tailored to specific contexts.

The framework addresses a crucial challenge: how can decentralized networks scale while maintaining the responsiveness and adaptability needed for complex, evolving environments?

## Who Is This For?

**Organization Designers** working on DAO governance and decentralized coordination structures

**Facilitators** helping groups establish or evolve their governance and operational systems

**Communities** transitioning from informal coordination to formal organizational structures

**Developers** implementing governance systems and coordination infrastructure

## Start Here

Choose your path based on where you are:

### Learning the Framework

**New to these concepts?** Start with [Framework Concepts](artifacts/primitives-framework/concepts/index.md) to understand the core ideas, dimensional lenses, and organizational patterns.

**Want the complete picture?** Read through the conceptual foundations, then explore the dimensional lenses (Phase, Scale, State) and organizational patterns (DAOs, Cells, Roles, Tasks).

### Designing an Organization

**Ready to design governance?** Follow the [Group Facilitation Guide](artifacts/primitives-framework/implementation/group-facilitation.md) through Discovery → Design → Implementation.

**Need specific patterns?** Browse the [tags directory](tags/) for organizational patterns and concepts.

**Looking for examples?** See the [RPP Governance Case Study](artifacts/primitives-framework/studies/rpp-governance-case-study.md) for a real-world implementation.

### Implementing Systems

**Choosing governance approach?** Review the [implementation guides](implementation/) for operational, community, and multi-stakeholder governance.

**Need technical tools?** Implementation guides cover selecting and deploying governance protocols, smart contracts, and coordination infrastructure.

## Framework Structure

### Core Concepts

The framework is built on two complementary elements:

**[Dimensional Lenses](artifacts/primitives-framework/concepts/index.md#dimensional-lense)** - Three perspectives for assessing organizational context:
- **Phase:** Developmental stage (Conversation → Formation → Organization → Iteration → Completion)
- **Scale:** Size and complexity (Collaboration < 10 → Coordination 10-150 → Constituency 100s+ → Network)
- **State:** Documentation of Purpose, Practice, and Progress

**[Organizational Patterns](artifacts/primitives-framework/concepts/index.md#organizational-patterns)** - Four fundamental building blocks:
- **DAOs:** Purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams
- **Cells:** Small autonomous teams (< 10 people) with networked autonomy
- **Roles:** Sets of responsibilities, permissions, and accountabilities
- **Tasks:** Defined work with clear deliverables

> **Understanding "Primitives"**: The framework uses "patterns" to describe organizational structures (DAOs, Cells, Roles, Tasks) and reserves "primitives" for technical implementation tools (smart contracts, tokens, governance protocols). The framework helps you understand your organizational structure before selecting technical primitives to implement it.

### Discovery → Design → Implementation

The framework guides you through a three-phase process:

**1. Discovery Phase**
- Assess your group's current phase and scale
- Map stakeholder landscape and organizational context
- Document shared understanding and divergent perspectives
- Produce discovery report with insights and direction

**2. Design Phase**
- Select appropriate organizational patterns based on discovery insights
- Choose governance approach aligned with group values and needs
- Compose patterns into functional governance and operational structures
- Get stakeholder feedback and approval on design

**3. Implementation Phase**
- Deploy technical infrastructure (governance protocols, coordination tools)
- Establish operational systems and information flows
- Launch with appropriate formality for current phase
- Iterate and evolve based on feedback and changing context

### Organizational Patterns

All patterns are documented in the [tags directory](tags/):
- **Organizational patterns**: [DAOs](tags/daos.md), [Cells](tags/cells.md), [Roles](tags/roles.md), [Tasks](tags/tasks.md)
- **Coordination patterns**: [Group State](artifacts/primitives-framework/concepts/group-state.md), [Community Governance](tags/community-governance.md), [Operational Governance](tags/operational-governance.md)

## Key Principles

**Flexible yet Coherent**: Patterns can be combined in various ways while maintaining interoperability and coherent structures.

**Context-Appropriate**: Different phases and scales require different tools, practices, and governance mechanisms.

**Transparent Coordination**: Clear documentation of group state (Purpose, Practice, Progress) enables decentralized coordination without hierarchical oversight.

**Permissionless Innovation**: Design for the freedom to work autonomously, attract collaborators, and propose to the broader network.

**Multi-Scale Governance**: Organizations operate at multiple scales simultaneously - design coordination mechanisms appropriate to each scale.

## Framework Applications

**New Organization Design** - Start from scratch with appropriate patterns for your phase and scale

**Existing Organization Evolution** - Incrementally transition toward more decentralized models

**Inter-Organizational Coordination** - Design collaborative structures between multiple organizations or DAOs

**Network Governance** - Establish coordination systems for purpose-aligned networks
