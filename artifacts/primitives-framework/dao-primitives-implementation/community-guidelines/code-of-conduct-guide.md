title: Code of Conduct Implementation Guide
description:
---

Your Code of Conduct defines non-negotiable safety boundaries. Break these rules and you must leave immediately. That's the only thing this document does.

This is not for behavioral expectations (use Commitment to Accountability) or conflict resolution (use Conflict Response Plan). Only safety.

---

## Creating Your Code of Conduct

Ask your community: **"What behavior makes someone immediately unsafe here?"**

Focus on actions that create physical danger, constitute harassment or abuse, violate consent, or threaten fundamental safety.

Write each rule clearly and specifically:

- **Good:** "No harassment based on identity, including race, gender, sexuality, disability, or religion"
- **Poor:** "Be respectful" (too vague, belongs in Commitment to Accountability)

Keep it short. If you have too many rules, you're including behavioral expectations that don't belong here.

## Example Rules

- No violence or threats of violence
- No harassment, discrimination, or hate speech based on identity
- No sexual harassment or unwanted sexual attention
- No doxxing or sharing personal information without consent
- No retaliation against those who report violations

---

## Enforcement

State clearly: violations result in immediate removal.

Specify who enforces, how violations are reported, and what removal means. Create multiple reporting pathways so people can choose what feels safest. Consider how power dynamics affect both violations and enforcement.

## Implementation

1. Draft rules addressing safety (not general behavior)
2. Write in plain language
3. Define enforcement process
4. Present to community for consent
5. Post visibly
6. Enforce consistently

Your Code of Conduct should feel protective, not restrictive. If everyday behavior might violate it, your rules are too broad.
