## Guide 3: Arbitrating Conflict

**For community members making binding decisions when mediation fails**

### Understanding the Weight

Arbitration is last resort. Your decision is binding—parties must accept it.

You decide on actions, not judge character. Goal is transformation and prevention, not punishment.

Good arbitration resolves this conflict and prevents future ones.

### Gathering Information

Meet each party separately. Hear full perspectives.

Review community agreements and any precedent. What did we agree to? How have similar situations been handled?

Understand context and systemic factors: Are power dynamics at play? Is community structure contributing?

**Recognize community stakes:** What precedent does this set? What does the community need to learn?

### Making Your Decision

Focus on forward-looking actions and accountability: What behaviors need to change? What accountability measures? What follow-up?

Consider immediate resolution and long-term prevention. What structural changes might prevent similar conflicts?

Balance individual needs with community health. Sometimes what one person needs conflicts with community safety.

**Check power dynamics:** Does your decision inadvertently favor those with more power? How does it affect those with less?

### Communicating and Following Up

Document decision and reasoning clearly. Explain how you considered different perspectives.

Set accountability measures and timelines. Be specific about what happens next.

Check in to ensure agreements are honored. Adjust if needed.

**Extract learnings for community:** What can we learn? What needs to change in our structures or agreements?

### Remember

Look for systemic issues, not just individual behavior. Your decision should help everyone move forward with dignity.
