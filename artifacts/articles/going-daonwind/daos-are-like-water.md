At its core, water is life. At their core, DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) are the essence of society. There is no “right” state for them both to be in, as they take the shape and form of whichever vessel best suits their conditions and purposes.

DAOs are like water. They take various forms and fulfill several roles, yet are recognizable for their existence as society’s H2O. Adaptable, recognizable, and versatile enough to play a uniquely essential life-breathing role within society. They plan on making waves in the places that will benefit society without flooding it with power and force.
