Artifacts may include:

- Other finalized materials for public sharing

Content in this directory should be:
- Well-structured and formatted
- Thoroughly reviewed and validated

To contribute new artifacts:
1. Develop ideas in `/drafts/` or `/notes/`

Artifacts are the public face of our knowledge garden - let's cultivate them with care.
