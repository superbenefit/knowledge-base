*Curated external resources - the foundation we build upon.*

# Library Directory

This directory is our curated collection of external resources and references that inform our research and knowledge development. The library includes content we've gathered from various fields to support our work.

Library content may include:
- Academic papers and research materials
- Relevant articles, blog posts, and web content
- Books, guides, and other long-form resources
- Talks, presentations, and other media

Along with external content, we include our commentary, analysis, and knowledge development based on these resources. The library is where we engage with existing knowledge to push our understanding further.

To contribute to the library:
1. Add new resources in relevant formats
2. Include source links and attribution
3. Provide commentary and connect to our work
4. Update library index and references

Let's build a rich, engaging library that accelerates our learning and creation.
