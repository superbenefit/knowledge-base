DAOstar (a [Metagov](library/Metagov.md) project) defines standards for [daos](tags/daos.md). The primary standard is the EIP-4824 which serves as a common interface for DAOs, akin to tokenURI for NFTs, so that DAOs of all shapes and sizes are easier to discover, more legible to their members, and more compatible with future tooling.
