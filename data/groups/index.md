This directory catalogues the organizations, [DAOs](data/concepts/daos.md), [cells](data/resources/patterns/cells.md), and collectives that contribute to or intersect with SuperBenefit's work. Group entries serve as reference points for understanding who is active in the ecosystem and how organizations relate to one another.

## What Groups Represent

Groups are the organizational structures within which people collaborate. They range from formally incorporated nonprofits to informal collectives and decentralized autonomous organizations. Each group entry provides a profile that includes the organization's purpose, its web presence, and its connections to [people](data/people/index.md) and [projects](data/projects/index.md) in the knowledge base.

## How Group Entries Are Structured

Each group page includes:

- **Title and description** -- The organization's name and a brief summary of its mission
- **URL** -- A link to the group's homepage or primary web presence
- **Members** -- Links to [people](data/people/index.md) in the knowledge base who are affiliated with the group
- **Tags** -- Thematic tags that connect the group to relevant [concepts](data/concepts/index.md) and domains
- **Related content** -- Links to projects, articles, and other knowledge base entries associated with the group
