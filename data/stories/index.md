This directory gathers the narrative content of the knowledge base -- [articles](data/stories/articles/index.md), [studies](data/stories/studies/index.md), and [guides](data/stories/guides/index.md) that tell the story of decentralized organizing in practice.

## What Stories Represent

Stories capture the human dimension of organizational experimentation. Where [resources](data/resources/index.md) codify reusable patterns and methods, stories provide the context, nuance, and lived experience behind them. Each story type serves a different communication purpose:

- **[Articles](data/stories/articles/index.md)** -- Formal publications and essays that share perspectives and findings
- **[Studies](data/stories/studies/index.md)** -- Case studies documenting specific implementations and their outcomes
- **[Guides](data/stories/guides/index.md)** -- Instructional content that teaches skills and concepts

## How Story Entries Are Structured

Each story page includes:

- **Title and description** -- The story name and a brief summary of its focus
- **Author** -- Links to the [people](data/people/index.md) who contributed the work
- **Tags** -- Thematic connections to relevant [concepts](data/concepts/index.md) and domains
- **URL** -- A link to any externally published version, where applicable
- **Body** -- The full narrative content
