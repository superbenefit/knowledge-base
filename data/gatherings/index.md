This directory records the events, conferences, workshops, and meetings connected to SuperBenefit's network. Gathering entries link the knowledge base to real-world events, documenting when and where [people](data/people/index.md) came together and what those meetings produced.

## What Gatherings Represent

Gatherings are the temporal anchors of community activity. They capture the occasions when participants convene -- whether in person or virtually -- to share knowledge, make decisions, or collaborate on shared work. Gatherings often serve as catalysts for new ideas and relationships, and frequently produce artifacts such as articles, meeting notes, or project proposals that feed back into the knowledge base.

## How Gathering Entries Are Structured

Each gathering page includes:

- **Title and description** -- The event's name and a summary of its purpose
- **Location** -- Where the gathering took place, linking to [places](data/places/index.md) where applicable
- **Dates** -- Start and end dates for the event
- **Tags** -- Thematic tags connecting the gathering to relevant [concepts](data/concepts/index.md) and domains
- **Related content** -- Links to participating [people](data/people/index.md), organizing [groups](data/groups/index.md), and artifacts produced at the event
