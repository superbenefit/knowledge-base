This directory maintains a curated library of external resources -- articles, studies, guides, books, platforms, and tools -- that inform and complement the SuperBenefit knowledge commons.

## What Links Represent

Links bridge the knowledge base to the wider ecosystem of research, practice, and tooling. Each entry documents an external resource with enough context for readers to understand its relevance without leaving the vault. Links are organized into thematic collections that align with key areas of inquiry.

## How Link Entries Are Structured

Each link page includes:

- **Title and description** -- The resource name and a summary of its relevance
- **URL** -- The canonical link to the external resource
- **Author** -- The original creator or publishing organization
- **Link type** -- The kind of resource (article, study, guide, pattern, book, platform, etc.)
- **Tags** -- Thematic connections to relevant [concepts](data/concepts/index.md) and domains
- **Body** -- A summary or commentary that situates the resource within SuperBenefit's work
