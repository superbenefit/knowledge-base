Crypto Altruism's 2022 year-in-review provides comprehensive documentation of significant Web3 social [impact](data/concepts/impact.md) developments, spanning humanitarian aid delivery to environmental conservation funding to [decentralized](data/concepts/decentralization.md) identity for refugees to transparent charitable giving. The review demonstrates breadth of [blockchain](data/concepts/blockchain.md) social applications beyond financial speculation, showing concrete implementations serving real [community](data/concepts/community.md) needs. Rather than promotional content highlighting only successes, the documentation includes honest assessment of both achievements and persistent challenges, providing realistic picture of Web3 social impact landscape. This creates valuable resource for understanding what blockchain mechanisms accomplish in practice versus aspirational claims.

### Key Highlights

- **Diverse Impact Domains**: The review spans humanitarian relief, environmental conservation, financial inclusion, healthcare, education, [governance](data/concepts/governance.md), and other social domains—showing blockchain applications across impact areas not single narrow use case.

- **Concrete Implementations**: Rather than theoretical possibilities, Crypto Altruism documents actual 2022 deployments with real beneficiaries and measurable outcomes, providing evidence of blockchain social impact beyond pilot projects or whitepapers.

- **Honest Assessment**: The review acknowledges both successes and limitations, discussing what worked well alongside persistent challenges including adoption barriers, technical complexity, and regulatory uncertainty.

- **Innovation Documentation**: The year-in-review creates historical record of Web3 social impact evolution, enabling understanding of field development rather than only capturing current moment without context.

- **Practitioner Visibility**: By documenting developments, Crypto Altruism creates visibility for organizations doing social impact work, helping them find collaborators, funders, and learning partners.

- **Evidence Base**: The comprehensive documentation provides evidence for assessing Web3 social impact claims, enabling more informed evaluation than relying on isolated examples or promotional announcements.

### Practical Applications

This documentation enables informed social impact engagement:

- Impact organizations can review documented developments when considering blockchain adoption, learning from others' experiences across domains rather than experimenting without reference to what's been attempted

- Funders can understand Web3 social impact landscape through the year-review, making more informed decisions about which approaches show promise versus which remain speculative despite claims

- Researchers can use annual documentation as data source for studying Web3 social impact evolution, tracking what developments persist versus what proves unsustainable

- Students can access comprehensive overview of blockchain social applications, understanding field beyond simplified examples or theoretical possibilities

- Practitioners can discover collaborators through documented work, connecting with others implementing similar approaches in different contexts or addressing complementary challenges

### Connection With SuperBenefit

- Crypto Altruism's comprehensive documentation across impact domains validates SuperBenefit's understanding that [coordination](data/concepts/coordination.md) [primitives](data/concepts/primitives.md) should serve diverse missions not single use case—showing that effective DAO tools must accommodate different organizational needs from humanitarian response to environmental restoration to community organizing, each requiring adapted coordination approaches.

- The honest assessment including both successes and challenges resonates with SuperBenefit's commitment to realistic evaluation rather than promotional hype, demonstrating that genuinely serving community requires acknowledging persistent barriers alongside documenting achievements—showing that effective development requires learning from both what works and what doesn't.

- Year-review format creating historical record validates SuperBenefit's approach to documenting coordination primitive development over time, recognizing that understanding requires tracking evolution not just current implementations—showing how coordination tools and practices develop through iterative learning rather than appearing fully formed.
