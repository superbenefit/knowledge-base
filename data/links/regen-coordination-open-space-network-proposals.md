Regen Coordination's open space for network structure proposals exemplifies participatory approach to [governance](data/concepts/governance.md) design where [communities](data/concepts/community.md) collectively explore organizational possibilities rather than accepting predetermined structures. The open forum invites diverse stakeholders to propose ideas about how regenerative networks should coordinate, make decisions, and distribute resources—creating space for emergence rather than implementing expert-designed systems. This process embodies regenerative values by treating [coordination](data/concepts/coordination.md) design itself as collective work requiring diverse perspectives, acknowledging that those participating in networks understand coordination needs better than external designers. The open space demonstrates how organizations can develop governance through ongoing dialogue rather than one-time founding decisions.

### Key Highlights

- **Participatory Structure Design**: The open space enables community members to propose network structure ideas rather than accepting predetermined governance, showing how coordination design can be participatory work involving those who will use systems.

- **Emergent Rather Than Imposed**: Regen Coordination demonstrates commitment to emergent governance by creating space for proposals to develop through dialogue rather than implementing expert-designed structures, recognizing that effective coordination emerges from community wisdom.

- **Diverse Stakeholder Input**: The forum welcomes proposals from various network participants—not just founders or core contributors—ensuring that structure design reflects diverse needs and perspectives rather than only serving initial organizers.

- **Iterative Development**: The ongoing nature of the open space shows governance as continuous adaptation rather than one-time design, enabling networks to evolve structures as understanding and needs change over time.

- **Transparency in Design Process**: By conducting structure discussions publicly, Regen Coordination makes governance development visible to all participants rather than having decisions emerge from private conversations, enabling broader input and accountability.

### Practical Applications

This participatory design approach enables emergent coordination:

- Networks can create similar open spaces when developing governance structures, inviting community proposals and deliberation rather than implementing predetermined systems designed by founders or consultants

- Organizations can treat governance as ongoing participatory work rather than one-time decisions, creating forums for continuous structure discussion as communities learn what coordination approaches serve their needs

- Facilitation teams can use open space methods to surface diverse perspectives on organizational design, ensuring that structure reflects community wisdom rather than only expert opinions or familiar patterns

- Regenerative projects can demonstrate values through participatory design processes, showing commitment to collective wisdom and emergence rather than imposing predetermined "best practices"

- Researchers can study how participatory structure design unfolds, understanding what enables communities to develop effective governance through collective deliberation versus what challenges emerge

### Connection With SuperBenefit

- Regen Coordination's open space for structure proposals demonstrates how governance design itself can be participatory collective work, resonating with SuperBenefit's pattern-based approach that provides adaptable frameworks rather than prescriptive solutions—showing that effective coordination emerges from communities exploring possibilities together rather than implementing predetermined DAO structures.

- The commitment to emergent rather than imposed governance validates SuperBenefit's understanding that coordination tools should enable ongoing adaptation as communities learn what serves their needs, suggesting that DAO primitives should support iterative development rather than locking organizations into founding decisions that may not reflect community wisdom.

- Regen Coordination's transparent public deliberation about structure provides model for how SuperBenefit can ensure that coordination primitive development reflects diverse community input rather than only technical implementers' perspectives, demonstrating that genuine participatory design requires creating accessible spaces for collective exploration of governance possibilities.
