The P2P Foundation Wiki stands as one of the most extensive repositories of knowledge on peer-to-peer theory and practice. Founded by Michel Bauwens and maintained by a global [community](data/concepts/community.md) of contributors, this living encyclopedia documents diverse approaches to non-hierarchical, commons-based organization across economic, political, technological, and cultural dimensions. The P2P Foundation describes their mission as creating "Hope with evidence" through documenting thousands of initiatives, guided by their motto: "Together we know everything, together we have everything" - demonstrating how pooling resources through commons creates prosperity for all. The wiki serves both as an archive of historical peer-to-peer initiatives and as an evolving resource tracking contemporary developments in distributed systems, cooperative economics, and commons-based [governance](data/concepts/governance.md).

### Key Highlights
- **Comprehensive Commons Documentation**: The wiki catalogues thousands of examples of commons-based initiatives, from community-managed natural resources to open-source software projects, providing one of the most extensive collections of alternative economic models available online.
- **Theoretical Framework Development**: Beyond just documenting examples, the P2P Foundation has developed sophisticated theoretical frameworks for understanding peer production, commons governance, and transitions toward post-capitalist systems, all thoroughly documented in the wiki.
- **Historical Perspective**: The resource traces the evolution of peer-to-peer approaches across decades, showing how contemporary digital commons relate to older forms of commoning and collective management of resources.
- **Multi-Domain Approach**: The wiki spans numerous domains including technology, economics, politics, law, and culture, demonstrating how peer-to-peer principles can be applied across different sectors of society rather than being limited to digital contexts.
- **Cosmo-Local Perspective**: The P2P Foundation has been instrumental in developing the concept of "cosmo-localism" (globally shared knowledge, locally implemented production), providing theoretical foundations and practical examples of this approach that bridges global and local scales.

### Practical Applications

The P2P Foundation Wiki serves multiple practical purposes:

- As a research resource for scholars, activists, and practitioners seeking historical context and theoretical frameworks for peer-to-peer approaches
- As a directory of existing projects and initiatives that new community efforts can learn from, avoiding the need to "reinvent the wheel"
- As a toolkit of governance models, legal structures, and organizational patterns that groups can adapt to their specific contexts
- As a reference for policymakers and institutional leaders looking to understand and potentially integrate commons-based approaches
- As an educational platform for people new to commons thinking who want to understand alternatives to market and state-based systems

The wiki is particularly valuable for its documentation of real-world case studies that demonstrate how abstract principles translate into practical implementation, offering both inspiration and concrete models for emulation.

### Connection With SuperBenefit

- Provides historical and theoretical foundations for many of SuperBenefit's core concepts, including cosmolocalism - a principle that has been extensively developed in the P2P Foundation's work.
- The wiki's extensive documentation of commons-based resource management offers precedent and inspiration for SuperBenefit's approaches to shared stewardship and community control.
- SuperBenefit's exploration of regenerative economic systems draws directly on cooperative economic models documented in the wiki.
- The P2P Foundation's work on knowledge commons directly informs SuperBenefit's approach to open source knowledge sharing and collaborative development.
