This directory collects the codified knowledge of the SuperBenefit ecosystem -- [patterns](data/resources/patterns/index.md), [practices](data/resources/practices/index.md), [primitives](data/resources/primitives/index.md), [protocols](data/resources/protocols/index.md), and [playbooks](data/resources/playbooks/index.md) that have emerged from real experiments in decentralized organizing.

## What Resources Represent

Resources are the building blocks for organizational design. Unlike [stories](data/stories/index.md) that capture narrative accounts, resources distill lived experience into reusable artifacts that others can adapt to their own contexts. Each resource type serves a distinct purpose in the knowledge commons:

- **[Patterns](data/resources/patterns/index.md)** -- Recurring solutions to common organizational challenges
- **[Practices](data/resources/practices/index.md)** -- Repeatable activities and methods for day-to-day work
- **[Primitives](data/resources/primitives/index.md)** -- Atomic building blocks that combine into larger structures
- **[Protocols](data/resources/protocols/index.md)** -- Formal procedures and standards for coordination
- **[Playbooks](data/resources/playbooks/index.md)** -- Step-by-step implementation guides for specific goals

## How Resource Entries Are Structured

Each resource page includes:

- **Title and description** -- The resource name and a summary of what it addresses
- **Tags** -- Thematic connections to relevant [concepts](data/concepts/index.md) and domains
- **URL** -- A link to any external reference material, where applicable
- **Body** -- The full resource documentation including context, application guidance, and related resources
