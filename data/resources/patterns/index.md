description: A comprehensive index of reusable patterns for decentralized organizing and governance
publish: true
type: index

SuperBenefit's Pattern Library documents tested approaches to common challenges in decentralized organization design. These patterns emerge from real-world experimentation, including the Reimagining Power Project's work with All In For Sport (AIFS), Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS), and Equality Fund, as well as broader DAO ecosystem learnings.

This library serves as a practical resource for organizations seeking to implement new forms of coordination, governance, and value creation. Each pattern represents a reusable solution validated through practice.

## Contributing to the Pattern Library

This library grows through collective learning. Organizations implementing these patterns are encouraged to:

- Document adaptations and variations
- Share both successes and failures
- Propose new patterns emerging from practice
- Connect with other practitioners through SuperBenefit's network

SuperBenefit patterns offer starting points, not rigid prescriptions, for organizations seeking to redistribute power and transform systems for collective benefit.
