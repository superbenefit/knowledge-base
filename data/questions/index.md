This directory captures the open research questions, generative unknowns, and lines of inquiry that sit at the growing edge of SuperBenefit's knowledge. Unlike [concepts](data/concepts/index.md) or [resources](data/resources/index.md), which document what is known, questions mark what remains to be explored.

## What Questions Represent

Questions are not resources to be commoned but explorations to be pursued. They articulate the uncertainties, tensions, and emerging possibilities that drive research and experimentation within the network. By making these questions explicit and trackable, the knowledge base surfaces the community's shared inquiry agenda and helps prioritize where attention and effort should be directed.

Questions may emerge from practical challenges encountered in project work, from gaps identified in existing knowledge, or from speculative possibilities opened up by new tools and frameworks. Capturing them here ensures they remain visible and actionable rather than being lost in conversation.

## How Question Entries Are Structured

Each question page includes:

- **Title** -- The question itself, framed as a clear and specific inquiry
- **Description** -- Context explaining why the question matters and what exploring it might yield
- **Status** -- The question's current state: open (not yet explored), exploring (actively being investigated), or resolved (answered or no longer relevant)
- **Tags** -- Thematic tags connecting the question to relevant [concepts](data/concepts/index.md) and domains
- **Related content** -- Links to [resources](data/resources/index.md), [projects](data/projects/index.md), and other entries that relate to or address the question
