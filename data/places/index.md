This directory records the locations and bioregions relevant to SuperBenefit's work. Place entries provide geographic context for [gatherings](data/gatherings/index.md), [groups](data/groups/index.md), and [projects](data/projects/index.md), grounding the knowledge base in physical geography alongside its digital and organizational dimensions.

## What Places Represent

Places range from specific venues to broader bioregions, capturing the geographic settings where community activity occurs. In a knowledge base focused on decentralized and networked organizations, place entries acknowledge that physical location still matters -- for in-person gatherings, for understanding the communities that projects serve, and for connecting digital coordination to the real-world contexts it operates within.

Place entries can be nested to represent geographic hierarchies, such as a venue within a city within a region, enabling both specific and broad geographic references.

## How Place Entries Are Structured

Each place page includes:

- **Title and description** -- The location's name and a brief characterization
- **Geographic coordinates** -- Latitude and longitude for mapping
- **Region** -- The broader geographic or bioregional context
- **Tags** -- Thematic tags connecting the place to relevant activities and domains
- **Related content** -- Links to [gatherings](data/gatherings/index.md) held at the location and [groups](data/groups/index.md) based there
