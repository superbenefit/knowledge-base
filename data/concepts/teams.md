Teams are self-managing, autonomous groups of individuals who collaborate to achieve shared goals through coordinated action and collective decision-making.

In the context of Web3 and [decentralized](data/concepts/decentralization.md) organizations, teams take on particular importance as the fundamental operational units that enable distributed [coordination](data/concepts/coordination.md) without requiring centralized control. Unlike traditional hierarchical teams that receive direction from management layers, decentralized teams maintain autonomy in determining how to achieve their objectives while coordinating with broader organizational networks through transparent practices and shared purpose alignment.

## Teams in Decentralized Organizations

The [DAO Primitives framework](../artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/index.md) uses the term **[Cells](artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-primitives/cells.md)** to describe small autonomous teams that function as the basic organizational units within DAO networks. These teams typically consist of 3-8 people (fewer than 10) who work together at what the framework calls "collaboration scale" - where high-bandwidth, synchronous communication enables effective self-[governance](data/concepts/governance.md) and adaptive problem-solving.

The shift from traditional teams to decentralized autonomous teams represents a fundamental change in how groups coordinate:

**Traditional Teams:**
- Receive objectives and direction from hierarchical authority
- Report progress upward through management chains
- Operate with limited visibility into broader organizational context
- Require approval for decisions outside defined scope

**Decentralized Autonomous Teams:**
- Define their own approach to achieving purpose-aligned objectives
- Document their state transparently for network-wide visibility
- Make independent decisions within their domain of responsibility
- Coordinate horizontally with other teams through clear interfaces

This autonomy combined with transparent coordination enables what [DAOs aren't things... they are flows](../artifacts/dao-primitives-framework/network-evolution/DAOs aren't things... they are flows..md) describes as "purpose-aligned networks" that can scale both efficiency and innovation simultaneously.
