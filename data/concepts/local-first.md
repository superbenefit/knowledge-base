_Local-first is a software development approach that prioritizes storing and processing user data locally on their devices rather than in centralized cloud servers, while maintaining the ability to collaborate and synchronize across devices when desired. This approach gives users full ownership and control over their data while enabling the collaborative benefits of cloud computing._

Local-first software represents a paradigm shift away from the dominant cloud-centric model toward applications that treat user devices as the primary repository and processing center for personal data. Unlike traditional cloud applications that require constant internet connectivity and store data on corporate servers, local-first applications store data locally while using the cloud only for synchronization and backup when users choose. This approach addresses growing concerns about data privacy, corporate surveillance, vendor lock-in, and digital dependency while maintaining the collaborative capabilities that make modern software valuable.

The local-first approach aligns with principles of digital sovereignty and user [autonomy](data/concepts/autonomy.md) by ensuring that people retain control over their information regardless of corporate policies, service availability, or internet connectivity. This creates resilient systems that continue functioning during network outages while preserving long-term access to data even if service providers change their terms or discontinue services. Local-first represents both a technical architecture and a [values](data/concepts/values.md) framework that prioritizes user agency over corporate convenience.

## Uses of "Local-first"

### Local-first in Application Architecture

Local-first applications store data primarily on user devices using local databases, with cloud services functioning as optional synchronization layers rather than primary data repositories. This architecture uses technologies like Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) and advanced synchronization algorithms to enable seamless collaboration between devices without requiring centralized [coordination](data/concepts/coordination.md).

Examples include note-taking applications that work fully offline, collaborative documents that sync changes automatically when connectivity is available, and productivity tools that maintain all functionality regardless of internet status. These applications provide "instant access" to user work, "device independence" through automatic synchronization, and "network independence" for core functionality, creating user experiences that exceed cloud-only alternatives in responsiveness and reliability.

### Local-first and Data Sovereignty

Local-first software embodies principles of data sovereignty by ensuring users maintain primary control over their information rather than surrendering it to corporate platforms. This approach addresses concerns about surveillance capitalism, data mining, and the loss of digital autonomy that characterize cloud-centric computing models.

By keeping data on user devices, local-first applications enable "user control" over privacy settings, data portability, and long-term access without depending on corporate policies or service continuity. This creates "future-proof data" that remains accessible regardless of changes in business models, company ownership, or service availability, aligning with digital rights principles that treat data ownership as fundamental to user autonomy.

### Local-first in Web3 and [Decentralized](data/concepts/decentralization.md) Systems

Local-first principles complement Web3 technologies by creating client-side applications that interact with decentralized networks without surrendering user data to centralized platforms. This combination enables truly peer-to-peer applications where users maintain both custody of their data and sovereignty over their interactions.

[Blockchain](data/concepts/blockchain.md) technologies can provide [consensus](data/concepts/consensus.md) mechanisms for global coordination while local-first applications handle data storage and processing at the user level. This creates systems where "collaborative features" emerge from direct peer-to-peer interaction rather than platform mediation, enabling new forms of cooperation that preserve individual autonomy while supporting collective action.

### Local-first and [Community](data/concepts/community.md) Technology

Local-first approaches can support community technology initiatives by reducing dependence on corporate infrastructure while maintaining the benefits of digital coordination. Community networks can implement local-first applications that serve local needs without requiring external service providers or ongoing subscription costs.

This enables community to develop digital infrastructure that supports local organizing, resource sharing, and collaborative work while maintaining community control over both technology and data. Local-first community applications can function independently during internet outages or when community choose to operate autonomously, creating resilient technological foundations for community self-determination.

## Local-first and Cosmolocal Coordination

Local-first principles align closely with cosmolocal approaches that combine local autonomy with global knowledge sharing. Just as cosmolocalism advocates for "what is heavy is local, what is light is global," local-first software keeps data and processing local while enabling global coordination through open protocols and knowledge commons.

This creates technological infrastructure that supports the localist principle of maintaining "sovereignty over local resources and [decision-making](archive/clarity/Tags/decision-making.md)" while "sharing knowledge and protocols globally through open systems." Local-first applications can enable community to "access global capital while preserving local control" by providing technological tools that support both local autonomy and broader network [participation](participation.md).
