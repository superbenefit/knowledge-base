_Protocols are standardized sets of rules, procedures, and agreements that define how participants in a system interact, communicate, and exchange value, enabling consistent and predictable coordination without requiring central authority._

Protocols serve as foundational infrastructure for coordination in complex systems, establishing shared languages and behaviors that allow diverse agents to interact reliably. Unlike centralized systems that depend on hierarchical control, protocol-based coordination distributes authority across networks, allowing participants to engage directly without intermediaries while maintaining system coherence. This approach creates resilient, adaptable systems that can scale organically while preserving transparency and participant autonomy.

In both technological and social contexts, protocols transform unpredictable interactions into structured, repeatable patterns. They reduce coordination costs by establishing clear expectations and procedures, enabling complex collaboration among parties who may have no prior relationship or trust. While technical protocols operate through cryptographic verification and algorithmic enforcement, social protocols function through shared understanding, cultural norms, and governance agreements that guide collective behavior.

## Uses of "Protocols"

### Technical Protocols in Web3

In blockchain and web3 contexts, protocols are the formalized rule sets that govern how distributed networks operate, communicate, and maintain consensus. These protocols are typically implemented through code that defines transaction validation, data structures, consensus mechanisms, and network behaviors.

Technical protocols in web3 include:

- **Consensus protocols** that establish agreement on the state of distributed systems
- **Transfer protocols** for securely moving digital assets between parties
- **Messaging protocols** for communication between different blockchain systems
- **Identity protocols** for verifying and managing digital identities
- **Financial protocols** (DeFi) for lending, trading, and other financial interactions

Unlike traditional software systems, the open and permissionless nature of blockchain protocols enables global networks of participants to coordinate without central authorities. As noted in the [Minimum Viable Permissionless-ness](../artifacts/dao-primitives-framework/network-evolution/Minimum Viable Permissionless-ness.md) article, these systems create "the ability for anyone anywhere to contribute creatively to a system" by establishing clear rules that maintain network integrity while enabling permissionless participation.

### Social Protocols in DAOs

In decentralized autonomous organizations, social protocols establish governance processes, decision-making frameworks, and coordination mechanisms that enable collective action. These protocols bridge the gap between technical systems and human behavior, creating structured but flexible ways for communities to collaborate.

Social protocols in DAOs include:

- **Governance protocols** for proposal creation, deliberation, and voting
- **Resource allocation protocols** for managing shared treasuries
- **Contribution protocols** that define how work is assigned, evaluated, and rewarded
- **Dispute resolution protocols** for addressing conflicts and disagreements
- **Permission protocols** that define access rights and responsibilities

The [DAO Primitives Framework](docs/dao-primitives/primitives-framework/concepts/index.md) describes these social protocols as essential components for scaling coordination across different organizational levels. By establishing clear patterns for interaction, DAO protocols enable both small team autonomy and network-scale collaboration, creating systems that can "evolve organically" while maintaining purpose alignment.

### Open Protocols

Open protocols are publicly accessible, non-proprietary standards that anyone can use, modify, and build upon without permission or payment. They represent a fundamental shift from closed, proprietary systems toward shared infrastructure that prioritizes interoperability, transparency, and collective governance.

As defined by the [Open Protocol Research Group](https://mirror.xyz/openprotocolresearch.eth), open protocols are characterized by:

1. **Public Accessibility**: Documentation and specifications are freely available to all
2. **Permissionless Implementation**: Anyone can build applications or services using the protocol
3. **Community Governance**: Development and evolution is guided by multi-stakeholder processes
4. **Interoperability**: Designed to work with other systems and services
5. **Open Standards**: Based on publicly documented specifications rather than proprietary technologies

Organizations like [OpenCivics](https://www.opencivics.co/) emphasize that open protocols create "digital public infrastructure" that enables more equitable, democratic participation in digital systems. Unlike proprietary platforms that extract value and control data, open protocols distribute value and authority across networks of participants, creating more resilient and equitable digital ecosystems.

### Protocols in Civic Systems

In civic contexts, protocols establish frameworks for public participation, deliberation, and decision-making. These civic protocols bridge traditional governance structures with digital tools, creating hybrid systems for community coordination.

Civic protocols include:

- **Participatory budgeting protocols** for community resource allocation
- **Deliberative democracy protocols** for structured public discussion
- **Data commons protocols** for managing shared information resources
- **Mutual aid protocols** for community support and resource sharing
- **Public goods funding protocols** for sustaining critical shared infrastructure

These systems enable communities to self-organize around shared needs and resources without requiring centralized management. As described in Governance for better futures, these protocols can help "shepherd emergence and serve more relational and systemic approaches to cooperation" by creating infrastructure for distributed decision-making and resource governance.
