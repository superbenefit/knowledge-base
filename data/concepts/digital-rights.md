*Digital rights are the fundamental rights and freedoms that individuals and communities hold in digital environments, encompassing self-custody of assets, [data sovereignty](data/concepts/data-sovereignty.md), [privacy](data/concepts/privacy.md), digital personhood, and meaningful control over one's participation in networked systems.*

Digital rights extend established principles of human rights and civil liberties into digital contexts, where the architecture of technology often determines what freedoms people actually have. Unlike physical spaces where rights are primarily constrained by laws and social norms, digital environments are shaped by code, protocols, and platform design decisions that can either enable or undermine individual and collective agency. The design choices embedded in digital systems are therefore not merely technical decisions but decisions about the distribution of [power](data/concepts/power.md) and freedom.

In Web3 and [decentralized](data/concepts/decentralization.md) contexts, digital rights take on particular significance because these systems are explicitly designed as alternatives to centralized platforms that have historically concentrated control over user data, identity, and economic activity. By building rights-respecting properties into protocol-level infrastructure rather than relying on platform policies, decentralized systems aim to make digital rights structurally guaranteed rather than conditionally granted.

## Uses of "Digital Rights"

### Self-Custody and Asset Sovereignty

Self-custody refers to the ability of individuals to hold and control their own digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, tokens, and credentials, without depending on intermediaries. This right is foundational to Web3 systems, where cryptographic key management enables users to maintain direct control over their economic resources and digital identity.

Self-custody represents a departure from custodial models where banks, platforms, or service providers hold assets on behalf of users and can freeze, seize, or restrict access based on their own policies or external pressures. While self-custody introduces new responsibilities around key management and security, it establishes economic [autonomy](data/concepts/autonomy.md) as a structural property of the system rather than a privilege granted by an intermediary.

### Digital Personhood and Identity

Digital personhood encompasses the right to establish and control one's identity in digital spaces, including the ability to selectively disclose personal information, maintain pseudonymous identities, and participate in digital systems without surrendering biographical data. Self-sovereign identity systems and decentralized identifiers provide technical infrastructure for these rights.

This dimension of digital rights addresses the tension between the need for trust and verification in digital interactions and the right to privacy and self-determination. Solutions such as verifiable credentials and zero-knowledge proofs enable participants to prove specific attributes (such as membership, eligibility, or qualifications) without revealing unnecessary personal information.

### Data Sovereignty as a Digital Right

[Data sovereignty](data/concepts/data-sovereignty.md) represents the right of individuals and communities to maintain authority over their data, determining how it is collected, stored, processed, and shared. In practice, this means giving data subjects meaningful control throughout the data lifecycle rather than burying consent in terms of service that few people read.

At the community level, data sovereignty connects to indigenous data governance principles and collective rights over cultural knowledge and community information. Web3 infrastructure such as decentralized storage, encrypted communication, and community-governed data protocols provides technical mechanisms for implementing data sovereignty at both individual and collective scales.

### Digital Rights in Governance Systems

Within [governance](data/concepts/governance.md) systems, digital rights define the conditions under which [participation](data/concepts/participation.md) is meaningful and free. These include the right to vote without coercion or surveillance, the right to access the information necessary for informed decision-making, and the right to dissent without retaliation. [Decentralized](data/concepts/decentralization.md) governance systems can embed these protections into their design through mechanisms such as ballot privacy, transparent proposal processes, and censorship-resistant communication channels.

Digital rights in governance also encompass the right to exit, the ability to withdraw from systems that no longer serve one's interests, taking one's data, assets, and reputation with them. This exit right provides a structural check on governance capture and ensures that participation remains genuinely voluntary.
