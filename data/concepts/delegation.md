*Delegation is the process of transferring [decision-making](data/concepts/decisions.md) authority, [responsibilities](data/concepts/responsibilities.md), or voting [power](data/concepts/power.md) from one agent to another, enabling more efficient [participation](data/concepts/participation.md) and specialization within [governance](data/concepts/governance.md) systems.*

Delegation addresses a fundamental tension in [decentralized](data/concepts/decentralization.md) organizations: the need for broad stakeholder inclusion in governance while recognizing that not every participant can engage deeply with every decision. By allowing participants to entrust their authority to trusted representatives, delegation creates pathways for meaningful [participation](data/concepts/participation.md) at scale without requiring constant direct involvement from all stakeholders.

In both traditional and Web3 contexts, delegation serves as a coordination mechanism that distributes specialized responsibilities across a network while maintaining [accountability](data/concepts/accountability.md). The design of delegation systems shapes who holds influence, how responsiveness is maintained, and whether power concentrates or remains distributed over time.

## Uses of "Delegation"

### Delegation in Token-Based Governance

In [DAO](data/concepts/daos.md) governance, delegation most commonly refers to the transfer of voting power from token holders to delegates who actively participate in proposal evaluation and decision-making. This mechanism acknowledges that effective governance requires informed engagement, and that many token holders may lack the time, expertise, or inclination to vote on every proposal.

Token delegation typically preserves the delegator's ownership of their tokens while granting the delegate the associated voting weight. Delegators can usually reclaim their voting power or redirect it to a different delegate at any time, creating an ongoing accountability relationship. This reversibility distinguishes delegation from permanent transfers of authority and provides a feedback mechanism that encourages delegates to remain responsive to those they represent.

### Delegation in Organizational Operations

Within cell-based and networked organizations, delegation operates as a mechanism for distributing operational [responsibilities](data/concepts/responsibilities.md) across [teams](data/concepts/teams.md) and [roles](data/concepts/roles.md). When a [Cell](data/resources/patterns/cells.md) or team encounters work that exceeds its capacity or falls outside its expertise, it can delegate specific functions to other Cells, contributors, or role-holders within the network.

This operational delegation differs from hierarchical command structures in that it typically involves negotiated [agreements](data/concepts/agreements.md) between autonomous parties rather than top-down assignments. The delegating entity defines the desired outcomes and boundaries while the delegate retains [autonomy](data/concepts/autonomy.md) in determining how to achieve those outcomes. This pattern enables complex organizations to scale their activities without creating rigid management hierarchies.

### Delegation in Sociocratic and Consent-Based Systems

In sociocratic governance models, delegation takes the form of elected representation between organizational circles. Each circle selects delegates to participate in higher-level decision-making bodies, creating a linked structure where information and authority flow both upward and downward through the organization. This approach to delegation ensures that operational perspectives inform strategic decisions while maintaining clear domains of authority at each level.

[Consent](data/concepts/consent.md)-based delegation differs from majority-vote systems in that delegates are typically selected through rounds of nomination and discussion rather than competitive elections, aiming to find candidates that no one has a paramount objection to rather than those who simply receive the most votes.
