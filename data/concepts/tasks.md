**Tasks** are specific, coordinated actions or duties assigned to [roles](data/concepts/roles.md) or [agents](data/concepts/agents.md) within decentralized systems, driving the execution of processes and the achievement of collective goals in both social and technological coordination frameworks.

## Tasks as Agreement Patterns

Within the [Primitives Framework](docs/dao-primitives/primitives-framework/index.md), Tasks function as **agreement patterns** that establish formalized commitments about specific actions, deliverables, and coordinated activities that need to be accomplished within DAO networks. They serve as the operational agreements that define **what** specific work needs to be accomplished, while Roles define **who** has the responsibility and authority to coordinate that work.

Unlike cells and DAOs which function as entities (network nodes), Tasks serve as agreements (network edges) that define specific actions and deliverables that need to be accomplished to advance network purpose and maintain coordination.

Tasks create the operational foundation for network activity by establishing clear agreements about specific deliverables, timelines, and outcomes while enabling autonomous execution without requiring centralized micromanagement. They work in conjunction with Roles to operationalize network coordination - Roles defining "who" has responsibility and authority, while Tasks define "what" specific actions and deliverables need to be accomplished.
