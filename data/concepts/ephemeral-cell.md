In the [DAO Primitives framework](docs/dao-primitives/primitives-framework/index.md), an **Ephemeral Cell** refers to a [Cell](data/concepts/cells.md) that is temporary by design, created to achieve a specific short-term goal or task, after which it dissolves or becomes inactive. Unlike other types of Cells, which are often built for long-term sustained operations, ephemeral Cells are focused on time-limited collaborations.
