Welcome to the SuperBenefit Lexicon -- your guide to the language and key concepts we use to explore [decentralized organizations](data/concepts/daos.md), Web3 [governance](data/concepts/governance.md), and social impact.

Think of this as our shared dictionary, constantly evolving to reflect our growing understanding of these fields.

## What You'll Find Here

This lexicon provides:

- **Clear Definitions:** Each concept page opens with a concise definition that situates the term within SuperBenefit's work and the broader Web3 ecosystem.
- **Contextual Understanding:** "Uses of" sections explore how the same term applies across different domains, from organizational design to social transformation, recognizing that concepts carry different nuances in different contexts.
- **Connections Across the Knowledge Base:** Related concept links, cross-references to [patterns](data/resources/patterns/index.md), and connections to project documentation help you see how ideas relate to each other and to practice.

## How Concepts Are Organized

Concept pages are tagged to reflect their primary function within SuperBenefit's framework:

- **Governance and coordination** -- Terms related to [decision-making](data/concepts/decisions.md), [power](data/concepts/power.md), [participation](data/concepts/participation.md), and organizational structure
- **Values and principles** -- Foundational commitments such as [transparency](data/concepts/transparency.md), [autonomy](data/concepts/autonomy.md), [privacy](data/concepts/privacy.md), and [solidarity economics](data/concepts/solidarity-economics.md)
- **Organizational patterns** -- Building blocks for decentralized coordination including [Cells](data/resources/patterns/cells.md), [roles](data/concepts/roles.md), [tasks](data/concepts/tasks.md), and [agreements](data/concepts/agreements.md)
- **Technology and infrastructure** -- Technical foundations such as [blockchain](data/concepts/blockchain.md), [protocols](data/concepts/protocols.md), and [platforms](data/concepts/platforms.md)
- **Social transformation** -- Concepts connecting Web3 to broader change, including [systems transformation](data/concepts/transformation.md), [regeneration](data/concepts/regeneration.md), and [impact](data/concepts/impact.md)

## How to Use This Lexicon

Each concept page follows a consistent structure: an italicized lead definition, followed by contextual exploration of how the term is used, and a list of related concepts linking to other pages in the knowledge base. If you encounter an unfamiliar term in other parts of the knowledge base, you can look it up here for a grounded definition and pointers to further reading.

This lexicon is a living resource. As SuperBenefit's understanding deepens and its work expands, concept pages are refined to reflect new insights and emerging patterns.
