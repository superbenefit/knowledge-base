This directory tracks the specific projects and initiatives connected to SuperBenefit's network. Unlike [groups](data/groups/index.md), which represent ongoing organizational entities, projects are time-bounded efforts with defined aims, deliverables, and timelines.

## What Projects Represent

Projects capture collaborative endeavors that produce concrete outputs -- research studies, technical standards, governance experiments, or community programs. Each project entry documents what the initiative set out to accomplish, who was involved, and what it produced, creating a record that connects organizational activity to the knowledge artifacts in the rest of the knowledge base.

## How Project Entries Are Structured

Each project page includes:

- **Title and description** -- The project's name and a summary of its goals
- **URL** -- A link to the project's primary web presence or documentation
- **Status** -- The project's current state: active, completed, paused, or archived
- **Tags** -- Thematic tags connecting the project to relevant [concepts](data/concepts/index.md) and domains
- **Related content** -- Links to contributing [groups](data/groups/index.md), [people](data/people/index.md), and resulting knowledge base entries
