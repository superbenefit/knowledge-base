This directory contains profiles for the individuals who contribute to, participate in, or are referenced by the SuperBenefit knowledge commons. People entries enable attribution, community mapping, and the ability to trace connections between contributors and the knowledge they help create.

## What People Entries Represent

People are the actors who create content, participate in [groups](data/groups/index.md), contribute to [projects](data/projects/index.md), and attend [gatherings](data/gatherings/index.md). Person pages serve as identity anchors within the knowledge base, connecting individuals to their organizational affiliations and the artifacts they have authored or contributed to.

Contributors are typically identified by their web3 identities (ENS names or pseudonyms) rather than legal names, reflecting the decentralized and pseudonymous norms of the ecosystem.

## How People Entries Are Structured

Each person page includes:

- **Title** -- The contributor's name or pseudonym
- **Aliases** -- Alternative identifiers or ENS names
- **Groups** -- Links to [groups](data/groups/index.md) the person is affiliated with
- **Tags** -- Thematic tags reflecting the person's areas of contribution
- **Related content** -- Links to authored articles, project contributions, and other knowledge base entries
