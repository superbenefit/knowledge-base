This section contains our community's structured knowledge—patterns, concepts, case studies, and reference materials that have been developed, refined, and organized for reuse. Unlike our working documents, the content here represents knowledge that has reached a state of relative stability and consensus.

## Resources

Our [resource library](data/resources/index.md) contains reusable knowledge artifacts: patterns that document proven solutions to recurring challenges, practices that capture effective ways of working, primitives that define foundational building blocks, and playbooks that provide comprehensive implementation guidance.

## Lexicon

The [lexicon](data/concepts/index.md) defines our shared vocabulary—the terms and concepts that enable precise communication about complex organizational ideas. Each entry provides definition, context, and connections to related concepts.

## Library

Our [curated library](data/links/index.md) contextualizes external resources that inform our work. Rather than simple bookmarks, each entry includes analysis and commentary that connects external ideas to our internal knowledge.

## Stories

[Case studies and articles](data/stories/index.md) document real implementations and explore ideas in depth. Studies capture what actually happened when organizations tried different approaches; articles provide formal analysis and argumentation.

## Directory

Entity records document the [people](data/people/index.md), [groups](data/groups/index.md), and [projects](data/projects/index.md) connected to this knowledge commons, along with [places](data/places/index.md) and [gatherings](data/gatherings/index.md) that provide geographic and temporal context.
