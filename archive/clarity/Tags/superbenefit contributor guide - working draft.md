# The Purpose of this Guide 
- The Purpose of this Guide is to support the mission and work of SuperBenefit and to enable the mission to move faster.
- The Contributor Guide will provide clarity to the SuperBenefit community about the opportunities available to take up existing bounties that interest them or to make proposals they think are aligned with the #[ethos](archive/clarity/Tags/ethos.md) and #[interventions](archive/clarity/Tags/interventions.md).
- Broadening the range of contributors to SuperBenefit will allow for the distribution of $SPRB to more individuals in an open and transparent fashion, and will make SuperBenefit more resilient and diverse.
- This guide will outline the systems of organization that characterize SuperBenefit, helping you to understand how and where your impact will be greatest. 

# SuperBenefit's Purpose - HEENAL - ok
- We’re running out of time. We need to make better faster. SuperBenefit exists to embed universal abundance into our deepest  systems, and to accelerate the arrival of a better future. 
- The combination of emerging technologies and practices holds the promise for a new set of societal systems, infrastructure, and institutions. As a [socio-technical transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#Socio-technical_systems_and_transitions), they present the opportunity to flip our civilization onto a new path, abandoning the limitations of our old paradigm for new ones fit for the complexity of the world we live in today. 
- There is much to do, and we’re ready. Find out how you can get involved and contribute to [six unique interventions](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/8Icbwygio4EJfEvh8we9Xz4IcZxzWfjyzmlMGXlxxjc).
- ## Purpose
	- SuperBenefit’s purpose is to embed universal abundance into the core infrastructure of the future.
- ## Mission
	- To develop the social and financial flywheels that enable invention, investment, and acceleration of a better world.
- ## Values
	- Believe in better
	- Act into being
	- Explore and experiment
	- Seek leverage
	- Learn and scale
	- Together, for all, for generations to come

- **Theory of Change**
	- SuperBenefit's [Theory of change](https://www.notion.so/superbenefit/SuperBenefit-s-Theory-of-Change-082185032e744923977928b06f46ec1f), expounded in [our first Mirror post](https://app.clarity.so/), is a logical hypothesis that connects the elements that contribute to creating an intentional change.
	- To help build understanding, we've developed **[four different "angles"](https://www.notion.so/superbenefit/SuperBenefit-s-Theory-of-Change-082185032e744923977928b06f46ec1f) **- alternative ways of expressing the theory of change and components within it.[

# Expectations - CALVIN
- =="This is what we expect of you - and this is what we don't expect of you. This is what you can expect of us - and this is what you can't (/shouldn't) expect of us." - NEED TO WRITE THIS==
- Working in the DAO/web3 space is likely to be (and feel) different from work in other organizations. This stems from both the use of emergent technology and the development of new norms and practices. Here are a few navigating principles that can help guide contributions at SuperBenefit.

	- If you're choosing to be part of SuperBenefit, you're choosing to be part of an experiment with a direction - a better future.
	- There's lots of unknowns and new relationships to navigate. Humility is our friend in this wilderness.
	- To get anywhere, we'll need to move quickly - this will require probing what might be, seeing how ideas play out, and then changing and adapting as we go. So, we'll need to hold everything lightly.
	- Nothing is permanent. Let's aim for what's good for now, as long as we avoid any unhelpful path dependencies.
	- We rely on people being proactive. If you see a need, call it out and act on it.
	- Inquiry is orientation. How might we? How could we? Why would we? How will we?
	- _It's like a finger pointing away to the moon. Don't concentrate on the finger or you will miss all that heavenly glory.'_ Despite all the bells and whistles, let's stay concentrated on the big idea and real-world transformation.

# Organization & Structure - HEENAL - tbc
- ==We could rename this section "Structure"? Will rewrite this soon, with more clarity on the governance structure==
- It's important to understand how SuperBenefit is structured. Having a mental model of the organization, how it works, where things are located, and the kinds of roles involved not only makes it easier to get involved, it also makes people better contributors. Reading the next sections, try to keep that in mind and form a mental model of the organization and how you might fit into the system.
- Artists, information and communication designers, developers, governance pros, process experts, systems designers, defi architects and engineers, facilitators, sense-makers, storytellers, are all welcome.

# The Work - HEENAL - ok
- SuperBenefit is stewarding impact at the macro scale by developing a series of outputs. These outputs are framed as six interventions for contribution.
	1. Mapping pathways to the future
	2.  Building capacity and interdependence through governance
	3. Creating a soul-bound portal to a better future
	4. A metacurrency for metagovernance, values, and acceleration
	5. A commitment to bridging old into better
	6. The look, feel, and story of a better future.
	7. Visual Representation of the Interventions
		- ![image.png](ca605232-556c-4503-8f3e-9fa27256ee0d%201.png)
- Through Proposals, Projects are initiated up to further progress on one or more intervention areas.
- How to get involved with current projects:
	- [Check out the Discord](https://discord.gg/QFW7Wc7cgS) - #helpwanted channel and #announcements 
	- Check out the "Active Projects" section of the [Community Resources site](https://www.notion.so/superbenefit/SuperBenefit-Community-7842086e42064061b7d48709c151c93c) to see if there are any projects that resonate with you
	- Reach out to @MBaldwin or @heenal from the Community Experience squad for some ideas 

# The Timeline - WHO?

- Work at SuperBenefit is organized into Revolutions. Revolutions are like seasons, creating a temporal structure for project timelines.
- ==Why "Revolutions"? It connects to circles, flywheels, evolutions and the desire for revolutionary change.  - WHAT IS CADENCE, PAUSE, REFLECTION - WHAT IS TIMING - GENERAL CIRCLE ==
- Revolution 0 (Rev 0), which ran from October 2021 to February 2022, centred around understanding the context and aims of coming together through SuperBenefit. We established our theory of change, identified key interventions, and established our core governance primitives and treasury. 
- Revolution1 (Rev 1), which commenced in March 2022 and is currently underway, is centred around tempo and taking action in relation to the identified intervention areas and is meant to take us to a minimally viable and sustainable state. How we get there is up to those who show up.

# Tool Stack - HEENAL - ok
- The way tools are used plays an important role in maintaining the coherence of the contributor community. Structure helps people have the freedom to get the important work done.
- Below is an outline of the main tools that we use and how we use them, understanding that there may be some variations between different projects at different times.
- ## Communication (internal)
	- ### **[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/rddG5gytNH ) **
		- Discord is the hub of communications. This is not only the first point of entry into the community for most newcomers to SuperBenefit and the site of day-to-day conversations, but also the site of knowledge capture.
		- It's best practice to use Discord for all relevant communication activities, avoiding the dispersal of conversations to email and other locations. Use the appropriate project channels, use threads where needed, and avoid DMs or group DMs for all but the most exceptional circumstances.
			- Information is transformed into knowledge through conversation and shared analysis
			- This knowledge is recorded and formalized in **Clarity**
			- If you're new to Discord, you might find this handy [Discord Guide](https://www.discordguide.xyz/) to be a helpful resource
	- **[**[Clarity](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/home)**](https://twitter.com/SuperBenefitDAO )**
		- Clarity is a hub of knowledge - it is our tool to plan projects, track tasks and a collaborative workspace/wiki. Not only are documents drafted here, but this is also a site of connection, making links between relevant documents. It's the site where lore and expert knowledge is built. Its value grows over time as more information is added and more links are created. 
			- [Guide to SuperBenefit's Clarity system](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/pages/a16db16f-ee23-4ae9-9d39-c86a0a1d89a5)
			- [Clarity User Manual](https://app.clarity.so/wiki/pages/e1bdb0ed-065b-458d-a666-ba1672e2fcdb)
- ## Communication (External)
	- External communications give people a hint of the internal knowledge. The best approach is to peek inside the workings of the DAO, pulling things that will grab interest and drive further investigation.
	- ### [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/SuperBenefitDAO )** **
		- View Twitter as a space to pulling memes and tidbits from the discord (plus announcements). It should be fun and inviting, a space to connect with likeminded humans and build relationships.
		- The tone across web3 Twitter is overwhelmingly informal. It’s casual, it’s friendly, it reflects the ethos that we’re all explorers together.[](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/0e80b649-d098-43c9-8b0c-bf84b551c1ae)
		- [See here for the full Twitter Style Guide.](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/0e80b649-d098-43c9-8b0c-bf84b551c1ae)
	- ### **[Mirror](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz) **
		- Long form writing, publishing formally realized insights from the community.
	- ### **[Website](https://www.superbenefit.org/ )**
		- The website is largely for routing people to information, communications channels, working areas, etc. Currently this happens by routing people to Discord.
	- ###  [Notion](https://www.notion.so/superbenefit/SuperBenefit-Community-7842086e42064061b7d48709c151c93c)
		- Notion is the home of SuperBenefit's **Community Resources site**.
		- This is intended to be a one-stop resource hub for new and prospective contributors, including:
			- an introduction/overview to SuperBenefit
			- a list of active projects and how to get involved
			- latest news and links
			- resources for both newcomers to web3 and more seasoned travelers
- ## Whiteboard / Design
	- Sometimes its important to sort through information in a collaborative, visual environment. White-boarding tools enable this.
	- ### **Miro **
		- Project leads and/or Contributors set up Miro boards on their personal accounts on a case-by-case basis and share them with applicable contributors as needed..
		- Best practice is to embed Miro boards back into clarity so that knowledge doesn't get lost.
	- ### **Figma**
		- The preference is now to Figma instead of Miro, because Figma's free plan allows more full users (users with edit privileges) compared to Miro
		- The Governance Research Project Miro board has been moves from Miro to Figma. This may not be a necessary course of action for all past/current projects, but all new projects should use Figma, in preference to Miro.
- ## Payroll
	- ### [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/)
		- Gnosis Safe is used to disburse funds from multi-sig wallets to individual contributors, based on approved Proposals
	- ### **[Coordinape](https://app.coordinape.com/circles/1655/history)**
		- Coordinape is used, as needed, to allocate tokens for a project and/or based on a peer-to-peer review process
- ## Governance
	- ### **[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/superbenefit.eth-) **
		- Snapshot is the voting framework that allows SuperBenefit and other DAOs to run our governance on-chain on layer 2 and execute transactions on Ethereum in a fully trustless way.

# Workflows - WHO? - leave out for now
- ## Workflows
	- ### Writing publication workflow
		- What's been the workflow for the writing that's published on mirror? Is there an editing workflow?
		- ***will come together with governance structure 
- ## Ways of working
	- ### **Working hours **
		- It can be helpful to feel community while working. One way to go about this is to have virtual office hours. People hop into a voice chat. It can be nice to have a shared playlist that can play softly in the background. A timer can be set for 50 minute of work, then mintues of down time to review what people have been up to. This can repeat throughout the session. 
	- ### **Discord bios**
		- To help coordinate scheduling it can be good practice include your timezone in your discord bio

# Community - CALVIN MICHELLE - include later
- ## **Lore **
	- Organization happens at the level of conversations. Lore is the linguistic landscape of aesthetics, narratives, patterns, and instructions which characterize network of individuals.  In other words, lore is the substance of effective communications. It is the connective tissue of people working towards common goals. 
	- Lore will play a critical in role in coordinating SuperBenifit contributors. However, lore is emergent. It can't be synthetically created. It happens on its own terms. The challenge SuperBenifit faces, as it grows, is to carve out space, celebrate, and elevate lore within the tool stacks and operational practices. 
	- This requires a playful attentiveness to:
		- narratives: stories, often from a personal perspective about important moments or distinctions (intros in Discord, Mirror articles, meeting notes in Clarity)
		- memes: aesthetic expressions of the distinct expert knowledge (to come)
		- history: the chronology of the organization. - ORIGIN STORY @ayusha01 
		- information architecture and categories
		- lexicons (specific to SuperBenefit)
		- roles and their histories of practice
		- the language of decision making
- ## **Rituals  **
	- Rituals are the shared activity that bridge decentralization and bring us together.

# Help - MICHELLE
- Learning how to get help is one of the most important aspects of successful collaboration. In an emergent problem, there is a shortage of certainty. Knowing who and how to find the information you're looking for is key to navigating these challenges. Check out the following to find the information and get the help you need.

Nate Feedback

The outline looks good! I feel like some of the questions we have been wrestling with in Forefront onboarding is
   - Pacing and amount of information (how not to overwhelm new contributors. how to boil it down to the most essential, and then leave the rest of it in a "resource hub" that they will have access to and browse, but isn't expected that they have to read, but would be nice)
   - Avenue of delivering information (we are doing a combination of email drip campaign, one on ones, cohort orientation, and the "resource hub". In a way, almost everything can easily be ignored, even the cohort orientation since they don't have to be paying attention. It seems to me that the best way to deliver the most essential information is in a one-on-one with the person who is stewarding their working group they will be apart of)
   - Different contributors needing different information (like the info that someone onboarding to the Product team is very different from what the Media or Community team needs... but then people on the community team are the ones organizing the onboarding process. So how can I as member of the community team help the Product/Media teams put together a good onboarding process for their new contributors?)

Next Steps
1. Clarify governance structure/mental model and how projects fit into this
	- Clarify discord structure - projects/squads
2. Working groups/Projects - core work, maybe governance and operations are the core work and 
3. Calvin will flesh out more pieces in the guide above (with "best practice" if not sure)



To be effective contributors need to have the mental models and understand the structure and how it functions.
Minimum viable Contributor Guide.
Fluid ethos for DAO and contributor guide to demonstrate this - Offering space for communication, getting input and scope for improving. 
SB is emergent and self organizing way 
Describing starting conditions, give people the self organizing capacity and for people to jump in where we need work
Nate
- Changing information and outdated info happens quickly - what is process for review and updates
- Being interviewed by the team lead or those stewarding, first contact to come on as a contributor, SB is a bit different because fluid, FF has a base salary
- Head of community does a 1:1, email drip campaign of what is most essential, long docs of contribution background but people don't read it
- Group presentation for those who have recently have been onboarded 
- Personal back and forth for them to ask questions is so important, so they can build out context and understanding
- Community, Product, Media Team have different needs 

Next Steps:
- Fluidity and contribution concept at next meeting
- People to add comments and edits to existing doc



Notes June 3
- observing and capturing the lore process - stories that are told and retold and the important stories emerge over time, each individual story that bring them is what is core when a DAO is early in its emegence
- Origin Story - what individual - why are they here, learning, moments 
- Ash - to send Calvin some storytelling lore content connected to Indigenous and Black community
- Times of reflection/seasons/how evaluate past - nothing formal yet - we don't have anything yet 

Next Steps
- MB to send reminder June 10
- Add content before June 17
- Post to SB - feedback - link to token distribution for those active in Discord - is this helpful, what else would be helpful
- Test with new people onboarding too
- Bring to General Circle about Seasons/Reflections/How to Evaluate Past 
- Origin Story next steps
- Continue with updating SB governance structure
