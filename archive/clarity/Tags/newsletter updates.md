**SuperBenefit Update - December 22, 2022**

**NEW - SuperBenefit Weekly Meet Up**
On Mondays at 8:30pm ET starting January 10th we will have an open meet up to share updates on projects and ideas as a collective. DM @MBaldwin to bring forward any particular topics or just show up. 
**PROJECT UPDATES**
**_SBP 8: DAO Primitive Project_**
The DAO primitive project has been working in collaboration with All in for Sport to develop and implement governance for the AIFS as it evolves out of its starting community of contributors. This partnership brings together the work that we have been doing over the past year on DAOs as fractal centerless networks, into a practical real world project that has potential for huge scale and positive transformation. 
We have spun up an AIFS governance team and are currently developing:
- Governance documentation and governance state
- Early community badging/access control
- Community proposal development and voting
- DAO CELLS as operating primitives

You can follow AIFS governance design journey [here](https://www.figma.com/file/G77aOdrUeg6494UrGHs47C/Governance-Research-Project?node-id=0%3A1&t=9T6Apvng8uVXEePj-1) 

**_SBP 9: Krause House Collaboration - Transformation Mapping_**
- **Transformation Mapping**
- We are working with Krause House to explore how professional sport might be shaped towards preferred and possible futures. 

We are currently halfway through this process and will be producing a draft 'transformation map' early in the New Year. 

This project is also enabling us to experiment with how we  work with other DAOs and support groups to clarify pathways towards shared goals.

**_SBP10: Windfall Dynamic Energy Labeling Through NFTs_**
The federal government in Canada will be making decisions in early 2023. 
**_SBP11: DAO Systems Transformation Repository/Library_**
A core group of contributors have been using the SuperBenefit DAO Cell model to guide its work [https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/docs/30f4e383-8a3c-4364-89e3-26682ca3051f](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/docs/30f4e383-8a3c-4364-89e3-26682ca3051f) 

Core Purpose: To build a repository of DAOs and other web3 projects that go beyond charity/philanthropy impact and align with agreed-upon definitions of “systems transformation”, and to analyze what has enabled and constrained their systems transformation aspirations.
Through weekly meet ups we have been researching and developing a draft systems transformation framework [https://www.figma.com/file/uY3nFt3lRZC8q7XfVKG2Xi/System-Transformation-Project?node-id=217%3A41&t=2YN2Utb3ojUmd4g2-0](https://www.figma.com/file/uY3nFt3lRZC8q7XfVKG2Xi/System-Transformation-Project?node-id=217%3A41&t=2YN2Utb3ojUmd4g2-0) 

**web3 systems transformation learning series**
In partnership with Crypto Culture and Society DAO's UnSemester Michelle, Heenal and Nate developed a four part series exploring: What do we mean by “systems transformation”? What’s its role in creating better futures? What challenges might hold us back? What are some web3 examples demonstrating the potential of systems transformation? The talented @heenal captured the session with a Poetic Harvest each week. Here is a summary of all links and content from the sessions [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLqlF86bnTcQhRl4DO8BLzBdBOhp6Y6OFCyHzJtqR0I/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLqlF86bnTcQhRl4DO8BLzBdBOhp6Y6OFCyHzJtqR0I/edit)

# SuperBenefit Update - Sept 15, 2022****
## **Project Updates**
**SBP 8: DAO Primitive Project**

The DAO primitive concept is a line of thinking that has the potential to become a core approach to how we do DAOs and DAO networks. We want to push forward the DAO primitive work that is already underway by creating a formal project with token funding to build a community of contributors and momentum.  
This is to be a “creative cell” with maximum freedom to explore, and thus this proposal is for a relatively small amount of token funding. This means that as this project evolves and progress is made, more funding can be proposed as needed. Making this a “safe to fail” bet for SuperBenefit (Check out [https://tinyurl.com/5fftvxyu](/) for more context). 
Current work on the DAO primitive models can be seen here: [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVODY0_-c=/](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVODY0_-c=/) 
Current proposal [https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/work/SUP-257](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/work/SUP-257) 
Any questions contact @Rowan  
## ****Proposals in Process****
******SBP 9: Krause House Collaboration**
This is a proposal to collaborate with Krause House in developing a transformation map for the future of sport. 
The purpose of this project is to prototype DAO2DAO collaborations with DAOs that have transformative potential, where we might be able to assist through collaborative sense making and direction setting related to transformation.
For holders of $SPRB,  you are invited to vote before September 18 at 12:40pm ET on Snapshot. Any questions contact @Lewwwk [
https://snapshot.org/#/superbenefit.eth/proposal/0x2301700340ba5308ae61346ce43ac4d22ab853b9f53603e7a3da050b3f11adbd](https://snapshot.org/#/superbenefit.eth/proposal/0x2301700340ba5308ae61346ce43ac4d22ab853b9f53603e7a3da050b3f11adbd) 
******SBP10: DAO Systems Transformation Library
**To build a repository of projects and DAOs that align with “systems transformation” and go beyond charity/philanthropy impact and includes and demonstrates the interdependence and interplay of the following properties:
- Equitable access to opportunity, support, services, and resources.
- Regenerative and distributive economies.
- Self-determination, rights, and sovereignty of identity.
- Care and conservation of all life, ecosystems, knowledge, and culture

This proposal will be put up on #proposal development channel for input and then up for voting by those with $SPRBInterested in this project please connect with @MBaldwin.
**Windfall Dynamic Energy Labeling Through NFTs**
A proposal to collaborate with Windfall Ecology Centre for coordinating stake-holder driven development of an residential energy labeling protocol is being explored. 
[Dynamic NFTs](https://blog.chain.link/what-is-a-dynamic-nft/) present a new opportunity for trustful, permissioned information sharing that provides a particular advantage where multi-stakeholder coordination and information sharing is difficult, and where improvements to coordination can produce substantial benefits to stakeholders. This matches the challenges present in addressing residential energy efficiency where multiple departments at multiple levels of government, utility providers, finance providers, contractors and HVAC suppliers, homeowners and tenants, all play an important role in trying to reduce energy consumption in the face of net-zero targets and the climate emergency.
This project and proposal are in process. Interested in this project connect with @Lewwwk Stay tuned for more information.
## **How to Vote on Proposals**
If you have received $SPRB tokens  early contributors, contributor guide, governance conversations so if you hold $SPRB you can vote! You do need to connect your wallet to vote. Here is a link to how to vote on Snapshot [https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/vote](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/vote)

It is fairly straightforward but if you have any questions on voting let us know!

Clarity is hosting a 4 week DAO contributor immersive program that **@CarynTan** is creating & hosting & **@heenal** will join & has been offering ideas to. 
Clarity [https://www.clarity.so/](https://www.clarity.so/) is a collaborative workspace and a tool that SuperBenefit & other DAOs are utilizing. The cool thing is how the Clarity team is engaging those using it in making  it and shaping it to what they need. 
It would be awesome to have someone else from SuperBenefit join this immersive program with Heenal so we can build our Clarity skills. 
Reach out to @heenal or @CarynTan if you're curious and would like to learn more!

## SuperBenefit weekly update - March 23, 2022

**Reflection Continues**
- The General Circle is going through a process of reflection, making sure that learnings from Revolution 0 are captured and that we hold space for those learnings to inform our plans for Revolution 1.

- 

**Proposals in Progress**
- We are developing proposals for the first two projects of Revolution 1, a governance research project and a series of Twitter spaces specific to governance innovations. More info to come in the next week! 


**Project Updates**
- Work is also happening behind the scenes on the metacurrency and NFT projects. If this is your jam, let us know. Reach out to @MBaldwin or @heenal in DM.
- We are also developing a Contributor Guide about how to get involved with SuperBenefit, what are the roles available, and how we work together. 
- 

**Role Sign Up & Guilds**
- A reminder to select roles and check out the guild channels that will only appear if you select roles, check out **2｜🖐-role-selection**! More roles = more channels and now there is more discussion in the guild channels than before, so go check them out — especially the #governance and #research-and-sense-making guilds if you have even the slightest interest in governance and/or sense-making!

SUPERBENEFIT WEEKLY UPDATE - FEBRUARY 22, 2022

**SuperBenefit "Hello World" Launch TODAY!**
**Today, "Twosday" 02.22.2022 is the soft launch of SuperBenefit.** We have been working hard over the past few months and our "Hello World" crowdfund post and theory of change is now ready to be shared with the wider world.
SuperBenefit's purpose is to embed universal abundance and equity into our deepest infrastructure systems, and to accelerate the arrival of a better future. Today, we’re launching our Theory of Change, which is a description of how we’re proposing to go about achieving our goal. We believe that Web3 presents a chance to shape the core level technologies and cultures that our next societal infrastructure will be built upon. Think about how much the internet changed what we do. This could be another change at that level.
We invite you to read our “Hello World” post, and if it strikes a chord, join us and to get involved. There are 3 main ways that you can contribute:

1 - **Read and share** the Hello World post [ADD LINK]

2 - Take us up on one of the **6 invitations in the Hello World** post by joining our Discord and join a squad. [You can do that here.](https://discord.gg/GU7gyCCvua)

3 - **Purchase an NFT** to contribute to our crowdfund. In exchange for your contribution you'll receive a limited edition artwork by the Brazilian phenom Roberlan Paresqui, and an allocation of $SPRB, SuperBenefit's fixed supply governance token. All proceeds will go to a shared treasury, governed by the community, for the purposes of advancing our mission.
Any questions at all, let us know - @MBaldwin & @heenal can direct your questions to the right person.
We are excited for you to engage in this next phase of SuperBenefit!

**Need Help to Set Up Your Web3 Wallet?**
If you're new to web3, check out our brand new guide on **how to set up and fund your web3 wallet**, which you will need to do in order to contribute to SuperBenefit's crowdfund.
In order to buy NFTs, cryptocurrencies or other tokens, you will need to set up a web3 wallet and fund it with cryptocurrency. Your web3 wallet is much more than a place to store currency. It’s more like your passport to web3, an identity card, gallery and safety deposit box combined.

# Community Update - December 21, 2021
- ✨ WEEKLY UPDATE ✨
- Hey there SuperHereos!
- Welcome to the FIRST SuperBenefit Weekly Update :)
- To start with, check out latest mission & intro below! SuperBenefit has morphed so much and it's important to understand what we are doing together as a starting point 🙏
- **SuperBenefit's Mission**
- SuperBenefit's purpose is to create a better future for all through new societal infrastructure and institutions built on web3 values, architectures and protocols. An equitable, sustainable, and abundant world is here for the making - if we choose it.
- More than giving back or doing good, we are interested in opportunities to fundamentally reset how resources and authority flow through society, rewiring positive outcomes into the way things work. 
- For us, success means flipping systems of scarcity into abundance, and breaking cycles of dependency into interdependence and self-determination. 
- 
- **==Squad (working group) updates:==**
- ✨ _Community OnBoarding & Hosting _ - We have been reflecting on how to best onboard, support and engage all of you - including this new weekly Community Update 😁 Check out #upcoming-events and the updated links and resources in #start-here, too. Let us know what else you would like to see from us! 
- ✨ _NFT Project_ - We are working towards a January launch of our Series 1 NFT! See the link below for our latest ideas (evolving daily!) and join the #nft-channel if you're interested in helping to co-create this fun experiment:   ==Not [https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/764e1511-101b-4bcb-9c15-103fb1ef3ec9](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit1/notes/764e1511-101b-4bcb-9c15-103fb1ef3ec9)  sure what a NFT is or how it relates to SuperBenefit? Check out our new #faq channel!== Still confused? Join the #nft-project channel or ask a question in #help-desk :)
- ✨ _Governance_ - You'll see on the left of your screen that we have reworked the Discord channel list to better fit how SB is currently structured. Check out this video by @Lewwwk that walks through all the channels and how to use them: [https://www.loom.com/share/a4f3695c2b4d42e186c510a35ac5c234](https://www.loom.com/share/a4f3695c2b4d42e186c510a35ac5c234)

- 
- **Share your SuperPowers! Come and participate!**
- We know that it can be intimidating to get started in a new community, especially when you're not quite sure what SuperBenefit is and when you may be unfamiliar with web3 and/or Discord. 
- The  Community Hosting and Onboarding squad is here to help! The truth is that none of here fully know what this is or what it will become. SuperBenefit is what we all make of it. We have an amazing group of changemakers here and we're so excited about we can co-create and the magic that will emerge.
- Check out #start-here, select a role in #role-selection, and then jump into one (or more) of the Guild or Squad channels!
- If you're not sure which guild or squad is for you, you don't know how to get started, or you have any other questions about SuperBenefit or web3, jump into the #newbie channel or ask a question in #help-desk and one of us will respond as soon as we can :)
- Thanks for being Super!
- **Happy Solstice, Happy Holidays!**
