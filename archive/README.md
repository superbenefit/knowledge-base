# Archive

This directory contains read-only exports from platforms previously used by SuperBenefit. The files are preserved for historical reference and as source material for the active knowledge base. **Do not edit files in this directory.**

## Contents

### `clarity/`
A full data export from [Clarity.so](https://clarity.so), the project management platform SuperBenefit used before migrating to Obsidian. The export was generated by Clarity's built-in export tool and contains markdown files organized by Clarity's internal structure:

- **`Tags/`** (125 files) -- Wiki-style pages that served as Clarity's knowledge base. Covers governance frameworks, role definitions, contributor guides, squad documentation, and organizational concepts.
- **`Projects/`** -- Project cards tracking SuperBenefit initiatives (DAO Primitives, Reimagining Power, Krause House collaboration, etc.).
- **`Goals/`** -- Goal cards for strategic interventions and organizational objectives.

The Clarity export uses wikilink syntax (`[[page name]]`) for internal cross-references. Many of these links are broken in the current vault because they reference Clarity's flat namespace rather than the knowledge base's directory structure.

For a structured plan to extract governance-relevant content from this archive, see [`clarity/sb-archive-search-plan.md`](clarity/sb-archive-search-plan.md).

### `charmverse/`
A placeholder for content from [CharmVerse](https://charmverse.io), another platform used by SuperBenefit. Currently contains only an index file.

## Preservation Policy

- Archive files must **not** be modified, renamed, or deleted. They represent a point-in-time snapshot of SuperBenefit's operational history.
- Broken links within archive files are expected and should not be "fixed" -- they reflect the original platform's link structure.
- New content derived from archive material should be created in the appropriate active directory (`data/`, `docs/`) rather than edited in place.
- The `clarity/README.md` file is the original export readme generated by Clarity.so and is part of the preserved archive.
