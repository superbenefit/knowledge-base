# Web3 Library Current Status & Progress

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Next Review**: February 2025

## 🎯 Quick Summary for Future Contributors

The SuperBenefit Web3 Library has undergone a major curation overhaul. We've implemented a rigorous triple-gate evaluation system that reduced our acceptance rate from 38% to 15%, ensuring only the highest quality, values-aligned content makes it into the library.

**Your Next Steps:**
1. Write library entries for the 6 approved articles in `final-ready-to-write.md`
2. Continue evaluating new articles using the triple-gate system
3. Update this status document as you progress

## 📊 Current Stats

### Pipeline Status
- **Total Articles Evaluated**: 29
- **Articles Accepted**: 6 (20.7%)
- **Articles Rejected**: 23 (79.3%)
- **Previous "Essential" Count**: 11
- **New "Essential" Count**: 6 (after rigorous re-evaluation)

### Articles Ready to Write

### Documentation Status
- ✅ `rigorous_curation_strategy.md` - Complete framework
- ✅ `web3-library-workflow.md` - Workflow integration guide
- ✅ `final-ready-to-write.md` - Queue of approved articles
- ✅ `rejected-articles-log.md` - Full rejection documentation
- ✅ `values-concerns.md` - Edge case precedents
- ✅ `evaluation-template.md` - Blank template for evaluations

## 🔄 Workflow Status

### Phase 1: Re-evaluation ✅ COMPLETE
- Applied triple-gate system to all 29 articles
- Documented all rejections with reasoning
- Identified values concerns for edge cases

### Phase 2: Documentation ✅ COMPLETE
- Created comprehensive curation strategy
- Integrated into daily workflows
- Established clear file organization

### Phase 3: Implementation 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- **Current**: Writing library entries for approved articles
- **Next**: Test process on new article submissions
- **Ongoing**: Monitor and refine based on usage

## 📝 Key Decisions Made

### Values Alignment Precedents
1. **Extractive tokenomics = automatic rejection** (e.g., YGG articles)
2. **Pure technical without social impact = rejection** (e.g., Token Types Guide)
3. **Historical significance alone ≠ inclusion** (must also meet current standards)
4. **Multiple perspectives okay IF each adds unique value**

### Quality Standards Applied
- Rejected several "classic" articles for being outdated
- Prioritized depth and actionability over reputation
- Required evidence of real-world implementation

### Uniqueness Determinations
- Several governance articles rejected for >70% similarity
- Kept only those offering genuinely novel approaches
- Regional/cultural perspectives count as differentiation

## 🚀 Immediate Next Actions

### For Library Entry Writing
1. Start with highest-scoring article: "The Case for Social Money"
2. Use established format from existing entries in `/links/`
3. Follow the 5-component structure:
   - Metadata block
   - Introduction paragraph
   - 5+ Key Highlights
   - Practical Applications
   - Connection to SuperBenefit

### For New Article Evaluation
1. Use `evaluation-template.md` for consistency
2. Apply triple-gate system first (fail fast)
3. Only score articles that pass ALL gates
4. Document rejections in log

### For Process Improvement
1. Track time spent per evaluation
2. Note any ambiguous cases
3. Gather feedback on written entries
4. Adjust strategy based on learnings
