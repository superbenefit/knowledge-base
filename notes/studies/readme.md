# Case Studies Directory

Case studies provide valuable insights into real-world applications and challenges.  They offer a deeper understanding of how various organizational approaches have been implemented and the outcomes achieved.  Each case study documents a specific initiative, highlighting the context, methods, and results.  This collection serves as a resource for learning from past experiences and informing future decisions.

## Understanding Case Studies

Case studies are more than just narratives; they are analytical tools that reveal the complexities of organizational dynamics. Each study captures the essence of a specific project, revealing not just *what* happened but *why* it happened in a specific context.  Think of them as detailed accounts of organizational journeys, adaptable to various situations.

### The Value of Case Studies

Case studies offer several key benefits:

* **Learning from Experience:**  Gain insights from real-world implementations, avoiding potential pitfalls and leveraging successful strategies.
* **Contextual Understanding:**  Explore the nuances of organizational challenges within their specific contexts.
* **Comparative Analysis:**  Compare and contrast different approaches to identify best practices and effective strategies.
* **Informed Decision-Making:**  Use evidence-based insights to make informed decisions about future initiatives.

## How to Use This Case Study Library

To effectively use this library, start by identifying the specific organizational challenge or area of interest you're exploring. Consider the following:

* **Organizational Context:** What type of organization is involved?  What is its size and structure?
* **Specific Challenges:** What problems or opportunities are addressed in the case study?
* **Methods and Approaches:** What strategies and techniques were employed?
* **Outcomes and Results:** What were the successes and challenges encountered?

### Querying Case Studies

Studies can be queried in a dataview query like this:
```
LIST description
WHERE 
    type AND
    (
        contains(type, "study") OR
        (type = "study")
    ) AND
    !contains(file.path, "tools/") AND
    !contains(file.path, "drafts/")
```

Studies can be queried with dataviewjs using this type of pattern:
```
dv.list(
    dv.pages()
        .where(p => 
            p.type?.includes("study") &&
            !p.file.path.includes("tools/") &&
            !p.file.path.includes("drafts/")
        )
        .map(p => p.file.name)
);
```

%% Here is the bare query for fileclass field values:
```javascript
dv.pages()
    .where(p => 
        (Array.isArray(p.type) ? p.type.some(t => t.includes("study")) : p.type?.includes("study")) &&
        !p.file.path.includes("tools/") &&
        !p.file.path.includes("drafts/")
    )
    .map(p => p.file.name);
```
