# Gatherings Sessions Strategy

_This is a space to plan the vision for our sessions as well as to build out what each session will look like._

## Vision

This is an opportunity to AIFS to create a sandbox of sorts to bring in groups we have been connected with over the years and explore a variety of topics such as governance and funding challenges, and allow for a sharing of learnings and ideas in the sessions.

The goal is to build a community of supports with these innovators in sport. At the same time, we will invite developers and thought leaders in the social impact space to participate and help identify opportunities for exploration and development of ideas in the web3 space.
