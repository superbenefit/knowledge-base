# Post-KM Partnership Summary 

This summary is intended to provide a report on the knowledge
mobilization partnership, as delivered, and document the outputs and
metrics from the event.

## Knowledge Mobilization partnership description: 
Building on the learnings from the DAO model developed and piloted by All In For Sport, partners delivered a series of five Learning Sessions (Salon Series) and an online learning platform enabling community organizations to understand how to leverage Web3 technologies to support decentralized, grassroots-led sports initiatives. Salons were interactive, participatory online gatherings designed to nurture a networked community of learning and collaboration. They served as dynamic spaces for strategic exploration, knowledge sharing, and partnership building. Unlike traditional presentations, Salons prioritized co-learning and co-creation, aiming to build a continuously evolving resource or "curriculum" that reflected the community's collective expertise and interests.

## Start and End Dates: October 1, 2024 to April 30, 2025

## Deliverables

| **Deliverable Name and Description** | **Share Updates on Deliverables** [any changes to what was done and how, or links to any completed products etc.] | **Status** |
|---|---|---|
| Design and delivery of 5 learning sessions (salons) | We delivered 6 learning sessions in total. After the first session, it became very high level, and we wanted to introduce web3 topics in a way that was more approachable and somewhat basic. All of the community leaders and startup founders, together, we form a living laboratory of ideas and practices at the intersection of sport, technology and community development. The "All In For Sport Discord was used as a place for those native in web3 and familiar with discord to join. We also started a LinkedIn Community page for those in the professional sport world to engage and participate in the conversation. | Completed |
| Development of a learning/sharing platform for ongoing, real-time engagement, learning and sharing | The All In For Sport Discord was used as a place for those native in web3 and familiar with discord to join. We also started a LinkedIn Community page for those in the professional sport world to engage and participate in the conversation. Additionally, we created a dedicated video platform at [watch.allinforsport.org](https://watch.allinforsport.org) where all session recordings, poetic harvests, and resources are accessible to the community. This platform has become a valuable resource hub that continues to serve participants beyond the initial grant period. | Completed |

**Provide a short narrative description of how the KM activities rolled out or use the description above and add relevant updates:**

From this work, we were able to apply and were accepted into the International Olympic Committee's Tech 365 Explorer program. Tech365 explores bringing together a diverse group of 25 entrepreneurs, technologies, and change-makers from 16 countries worldwide. Each member adds a unique perspective to tech startup founders, together, we form a living laboratory of ideas and practices at the intersection of sport, technology and sustainable development.

As a way of building and growing our community, we have offered our discord to be a place for those within the Tech365 Explore project to come together, share knowledge and perhaps even become a source of Knowledge and connection for the grassroots level all the way up to the funders who support incredible work in sports.

Our hope is that as opportunities arise to be able to continue these gatherings and perhaps raise funding to support projects that emerge from these at the grassroots level at the way up to the funders who support incredible work in sports.

## Reflection Questions

1. **As you reflect on the activity(ies), were there any unexpected, noteworthy or otherwise significant results?**

When building out these sessions, we didn't originally know the level of knowledge that those attending the sessions would come with. After the first session, it became clear that we needed to introduce web3 topics in a way that was more approachable and somewhat basic. All of the community leaders and startup founders together formed a living laboratory of ideas and practices at the intersection of sport, technology, and community development.

The value of these sessions was to introduce web3 topics at a high level, and we wanted to learn more about how participants could apply technology to their specific use cases.

From this work, we were able to apply and were accepted into the International Olympic Committee's Tech 365 Explorer program. Tech365 brings together a diverse group of 25 entrepreneurs, technologists, and change-makers from 16 countries worldwide. Each member adds a unique perspective, and together, tech startup founders form a living laboratory of ideas and practices at the intersection of sport, technology, and sustainable development.

One of the most significant unexpected outcomes was the depth of cross-sector collaboration that emerged from these gatherings. Participants from traditional sport organizations who had never engaged with Web3 technologies began developing innovative pilot projects with blockchain developers. For example, two community-led projects received funding through the Giveth platform as a direct result of connections made during our gatherings:

- [Every Court Can Dream](https://giveth.io/project/every-court-can-dream): A grassroots initiative using participatory design and local governance to revitalize community basketball courts
- [Huottoja University of Ancestral Knowledge](https://giveth.io/project/huottoja-university-of-ancestral-knowledge): An indigenous knowledge preservation project using blockchain technology to record and share traditional sports practices

Another noteworthy result was the creative documentation methodology we developed through poetic harvesting. This approach transcended traditional note-taking to capture the emotional and aspirational elements of our conversations, creating artifacts that participants found deeply meaningful and shareable. Examples can be viewed at:
- [Gathering 2 Poetic Harvest](https://www.bonfire.xyz/allinforsport/gathering-2-harvest)
- [Gathering 3 Poetic Harvest](https://watch.allinforsport.org/gathering-3-harvest)
- [Gathering 4 Poetic Harvest with AI](https://watch.allinforsport.org/poetic-harvesting-4-ai)

The level of sustained engagement also exceeded our expectations, with many participants attending all sessions and continuing active participation in Discord discussions between gatherings. This demonstrated a genuine hunger for knowledge in this intersection of sports, community development, and emerging technologies.

2. **What now? What's next for this work and/or for this group of partners? If you're unsure, can you share what you feel some potential next steps could be?**

We are looking to continue our gathering sessions and are able to continue these gatherings and perhaps even become a source of Knowledge and connection for the grassroots level all the way up to the funders who support incredible work in sports.

We're looking to continue our gathering sessions with a focus on expanding beyond knowledge sharing to more hands-on implementation. Building on the relationships and knowledge base established, we envision several next steps:

1. **Ongoing Community of Practice**: Maintaining and growing our Discord and LinkedIn communities as vibrant spaces for continued learning, resource sharing, and collaboration. The relationships formed during these gatherings have created a strong foundation for ongoing peer support and innovation.

2. **Project Incubation Program**: Developing a structured incubation pathway for community sports initiatives looking to integrate Web3 tools and decentralized governance. This would include mentorship, technical assistance, and potentially seed funding opportunities.

3. **Regional Implementation Pilots**: Working with selected community partners to develop and document region-specific implementations of the models discussed during our gatherings. These case studies would provide practical examples for others to learn from and adapt.

4. **Expanded Partnerships**: Building on our successful integration with the IOC Tech365 Explorer program, we're exploring additional institutional partnerships including with sport governing bodies, philanthropic networks, and technology providers to scale our impact.

5. **Dedicated Funding Pool**: Establishing a dedicated participatory funding mechanism (potentially using quadratic funding or other Web3 capital coordination tools) to directly support community-led sport initiatives emerging from our network.

6. **Knowledge Productization**: Transforming the insights from our gatherings into accessible, practical playbooks, toolkits, and learning modules that can be widely shared and implemented by sports organizations at various stages of technological adoption.

Our ultimate vision is to establish a sustainable ecosystem where participatory technology, community wisdom, and innovative funding mechanisms converge to transform how sports initiatives are governed, funded, and implemented worldwide. The knowledge mobilization partnership supported by OTF has created the foundation for this vision to become reality.

3. **Share any stories, blogs, websites, anecdotes, materials that cover the KM activities and can help demonstrate its importance for the sector/priority area. Include links/URLs to supporting materials.**

Throughout our knowledge mobilization activities, we've collected rich documentation that demonstrates the impact and importance of this work:

**Documentation and Resources:**

- **Gathering Recordings**: All sessions were recorded and are available at [watch.allinforsport.org](https://watch.allinforsport.org/), providing an ongoing resource for organizations exploring this intersection.

- **Poetic Harvests**: Our innovative documentation approach capturing the essence of each gathering:
  - [Gathering 2 Poetic Harvest](https://www.bonfire.xyz/allinforsport/gathering-2-harvest)
  - [Gathering 3 Poetic Harvest](https://watch.allinforsport.org/gathering-3-harvest)
  - [Gathering 4 Poetic Harvest with AI](https://watch.allinforsport.org/poetic-harvesting-4-ai)

- **Community Projects**: Two initiatives that received funding through connections made at our gatherings:
  - [Every Court Can Dream](https://giveth.io/project/every-court-can-dream)
  - [Huottoja University of Ancestral Knowledge](https://giveth.io/project/huottoja-university-of-ancestral-knowledge)

- **Social Media Engagement**: Our growing community presence:
  - [LinkedIn Community](https://www.linkedin.com/company/all-in-for-sport/)
  - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/allinforsport)

These materials collectively tell the story of a growing movement at the intersection of community sports, participatory technology, and decentralized governance. They demonstrate not just conceptual interest but practical implementation and real-world impact emerging from the knowledge mobilization activities supported by OTF.
