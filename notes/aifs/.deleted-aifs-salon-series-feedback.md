# All In For Sport DAO Salon Series - Participant Feedback Summary

This document captures participant feedback and reflections from the AIFS DAO Salon Series, including retrospectives after the initial gathering and the final session.

## LOVED - What are we grateful for?
*What worked beautifully? What felt alive and true? What surprised us in the best way? What felt like a gift? What do we want to carry forward?*

- **Poetic Harvesting** summarizing the overall space discussion was the perfect touch for those along all of the workshop levels to plug into.

- We created space for sharing, learning and questioning. This allowed for those along all of the workshop levels to plug into.

- Team collaboration was epic and distributed according to strengths.

- I liked that we had experts on each topic but were also humble enough to discuss complex topics in an approachable way.

- Bringing in voices of new people and those joining the gatherings.

- The format worked well and the consistency meant that by the end crafting the flow for each gathering felt easy.

- Internal team cohesion, trust, and sense of shared purpose.

- Registration process was clean and clear.

- Clear planning and agendas with well-defined roles and timing.

- Excellent tech support.

- The social media amplification was really well done with images, engagement tactics.

- Blend of arts - music, poetry is not always done with sports so it's a interdisciplinary approach.

- We had such great teamwork and communications, any coordination was treated as part of the creative jazz, not a hierarchical structure, that's the core for good things taking shape.

- Poetic Harvesting touched me, I'm glad of spirit it embodies into the activity as AIFS works to be more than some live music into the activity in 432hz which can shift a sense of expansion.

- We presented info clearly and got people excited.

- Lots of engagement from partners.

- Got diverse and valuable contributions to the 8 guiding questions we asked.

- Rather & Jose - the tech worked flawlessly.

- Nicole - impeccable hosting!

- Shanny - great job getting so many partners to attend and engage.

## LACKED - What did we need more of?
*What gaps did we notice? What didn't quite come together? What felt unfinished? Where did we fall short?*

- Better use of the relationship database, I've offered guests on November we had for the last gathering, and I think with a better order for example: we all input potential guests, and we choose a date to filter TOGETHER, I think I had expectations of making more things together, not because we cannot do it alone, but because the fun part of exchanging knowledge and feedback during a filter of guests.

- I think at the end we overlapped a little of that energy by not having in consideration that relationship database, therefore this is more a call to use more the tools we agreed on use like Charmverse for upcoming potential guests, we will be able to gather better information for tweets and weavers.

- The formats changed slightly as we developed the series. I would like to know which format resonated best for all, and make that the format moving forward.

- If we are to do more, I think the topics and speakers would need to be secured much further in advance to allow for proper marketing and promotion.

- We need a verified tweeter account/warpcast presence, on tweeter to reach potential onboarders, on warpcast to reach potential guests/quality listeners.

- JOSE this point is already here under "learned".

- Thank you Heenal!

- We didn't get as much participation from OTF or Jumpstart as I had hoped. It would have been great to see more support there.

- I think we had a lot of builders in the space who were excited about what we are doing. I would like to capture this momentum and interest better.

- Lacked a landing page for participants to see the latest gathering notes, harvests, videos, etc.

- Not much ongoing conversation on Discord outside of the gatherings.

- Social media strategy to share out learning and content after could have been a useful amplification and storytelling strategy.

- Hoped for the "funders" to be more engaged - lack of engagement feels a bit like old patterns of funders not seeming themselves in the "work" and "community".

- Unclear how effective social strategy was.

- Could have been a good opportunity to have someone from outside of AIFS on the gatherings hosting team.

- More engagement on Discord after the call.

- Maybe didn't need two rounds of people introducing themselves to participate in.

- Would have liked more clarity on which sessions each org was most keen to participate in.

## LEARNED - What insights will stay with us?
*What shifted our thinking? What unexpected lessons showed up? What challenged us in a good way? What will shape how we move forward?*

- The current use of twitter is not good, because we only do 1-3 tweets, and that caused many of the AIFS gatherings tweet get a punishment of visibility, I think our twitter had 0 impact on this round.

- Suggestions: put the links of the tweet, use 3 hashtags, use a picture on the first tweet and tag 10 people (or contributors).

- To be honest I do think it can be done WAY better.

- AIFS is getting known both in web3 and the sports community is growing worlds together.

- Inspired by the work in Costa Rica and would love to explore collaborating with these folks.

- More analysis of learnings in between each gathering would be nice, as Merri said gathering data about what are we doing with that data?

- The need for this type of cross sector bridging in the wild resonated strongly with many. For me it shows we are on the right track!

- Reaching out to speakers showed a level of interest and excitement about AIFS in general. If we hadn't done these, I would have never reached out to these groups.

- Use of real stories for those who shared.

- Support for some of the folks connected to gatherings got invited to participate on Twitter showed a sense of social connection and reciprocity.

## LONGED FOR - What do we dream of next?
*What do we want to build on? What's calling to be explored? What bigger possibilities are emerging? What would take this to the next level? What's the next step on this path?*

- Would love to do an actual project with a partner over the course of the gatherings series, we have a Tech24/5, policy but anything that actually works.

- We need a web3 safety gathering, it would be a cool thing but anything that actually works.

- We book a bunch of Og's and natives who got hacked, to hear they story, it's important to note they did NOTHING wrong, but we know this is the BEST way to raise awareness.

- Continuing to connect the dots with the Tech24/5.

- Amplification and wise saving and storytelling of what was learned, partners and what is next.

- Plan a Harvesting Strategy ahead of time and have a dedicated Harvesting Team to capture, process and share learnings.

- Tie THE gatherings space for those in Tech24/5.

- Look for new opportunities to build and grow with our community. Open up working calls and test/develop projects.

- Local gatherings on spanish where I noticed the sports quality of professionals on soccer/football academies has some potential I see for regular local gatherings/local onboarding for sports web3.

## What went well
- We presented info clearly and got people excited.
- Lots of engagement from partners.
- Got diverse and valuable contributions to the guiding questions we asked.

## Shout outs
- Rather & Jose - the tech worked flawlessly.
- Nicole - impeccable hosting!
- Shanny - great job getting so many partners to attend and engage.

## What could have gone better
- More engagement on Discord after the call.
- Maybe didn't need two rounds of people introducing themselves.
- Would have liked more clarity on which sessions each org was most keen to participate in.

## Ideas for future gatherings
- Make it participant-led as much as possible. Consciously ensure that skilled speakers take up less than 50% of the airtime.
- Get folks to engage on Discord DURING the Gathering and give a brief Discord tour.
- Not sure where all participants are on their web3 journeys, but maybe a short Discord "web3 adventure tour" could be valuable.
- Looking forward to presenting the EF and/or ICS experiments as somewhat of "new things going through the RPP, adjacent to these Gatherings.

## What topics are you most interested in, related to the intersection of web3/emerging technology x sport for social change?

- Democratized and trust based funding models so we can tap into a different role of getting $ to the ground.
- Knowledge transfer (from the community) to peer groups.
- Opportunities to articulate/discuss how Web3 has the potential to change the game and disrupt more traditional approaches to social impact.
- Transitioning NGO models into the digital landscape for scalability of impact.
- Increasing base knowledge of Web3 through use case studies.
- Demystifying the concerns/legalities/regulation.
- Sustainability - how can we take more sustainable measures for the future of Web3. How can we connect communities further (i.e. fan engagement, AI, etc.). Case Studies - i.e. taking big organizations like FIFA and seeing how to technology could have maybe curbed the scandal.
- Development of a physical space to interact intimately with our donors/community partners/funds to engage and making things happen (together and separately).
- Community governance - models for consistent reporting/unlocking additional resources/peer support.

## What challenges/obstacles are you/org experiencing in your work that emerging tech could help address? Or, as a reframe, what successes could emerging tech accelerate?

- The negative environmental impact of blockchain as a barrier to current use.
- The assumed connection between blockchain as an infrastructure and the fear of crypto as a speculative currency.
- More efficient participatory decision making processes.
- Social finance and raising money - innovative solutions to decrease cost of sport.
- Impact and progress around positioning sports engines for generational impact.
- Building, supporting and coordinating global movements around gender justice in sport.
- Networks (female identifying coaches and leaders across the country).
- More transparent relationships/practices with governance, granting, investing, practic...
- Community governance and agency/ownership of operations.
- Building an effective agency to advance progress through a local lens in an efficient and effective manner.

## What topics/themes do you feel could really move the sector/sectors forward?

- Community governance and agency/ownership of operations.
- Collaborative models of development - how do we create assets and resources for collective impact/learning.
- Raising of money and the flow of money, how can Web3 technology support a more democratized and community owned way of global north donors deciding on priority funding areas and then releasing money based on their own interests.
- How can a sports organization/NGO start/get setup, which platforms etc.

## What stakeholders would be important to invite? What type of audience are we looking to have curate/invite?

- Decision makers who could support/scale the work.
- Youth (female identifying) in technology & sport.
- Philanthropic leaders who are looking to reconstruct their own practice (this is NOT the majority).
- Corporate funders - to help understand the priority in investment this can be, and the impact that is possible through a new funding approach.
- Government partners/stakeholders - we work a lot with DPR/school districts in the USA - and I think they are also thinking a lot about these concepts, but similarly haven't found the right solution yet - so would be good to share/learn together.
- Community-based orgs who may have an interest and the bandwidth to explore web3.
- Blockchains and blockchain foundations.

## What would be the objectives of these gatherings? How could we keep the momentum going?

- Knowledge transfer and movement building.
- Opportunity to meet and exchange with people.
- To learn something new, maybe we could have something like "Fact of the gathering..." (like fun fact of the day) or do polls/quizzes (short Kahoot/s) to keep everyone involved and learning!
- Build a network map?
- Could break into groups based on the knowledge levels of blockchain (beginner, middle, advanced).
- Actionable ideas and concepts being put into motion.
- Connecting in a discord channel in between for sharing of ideas, resources, learning in between sessions.
- Having a clear objective is really important.

## What outcomes would we like to see? As a collective and as individual orgs and as individuals?

- Collaborations and aligned projects.
- My hope is to see the beginnings of an impact network forming. A support system for those doing the work at all levels of the continuum.
