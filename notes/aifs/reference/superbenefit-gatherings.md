# SuperBenefit Gatherings

> SuperBenefit Salons have been **renamed** to "SuperBenefit Gatherings".

## What is a Gathering?

SuperBenefit Gatherings are interactive and participatory online **events** designed to nurture a networked community of learning and collaboration. They serve as dynamic spaces for strategic exploration, knowledge sharing, and partnership building. Unlike traditional presentations, Gatherings prioritize co-learning and co-creation, aiming to build a continuously evolving resource or "curriculum" that reflects the community's collective expertise and interests.

Key features of Gatherings include:

- **Network-Oriented Approach:** Gatherings focus on hosting a network rather than presenting information. They aim to connect individuals and organizations, fostering a sense of community and collaboration. 

- **Flexible Structure:** Gatherings do not adhere to a fixed format or schedule. They are designed to be adaptable, allowing discussions and activities to evolve based on the participants' interests and needs. 

- **Co-Creation:** Participants are encouraged to co-create the content and format of the Gatherings, ensuring that they remain relevant and engaging for the community.

- **Continuous Evolution:** The "curriculum" or resource developed through the Gatherings is continuously evolving, reflecting the ongoing learning and exploration within the community.

SuperBenefit Gatherings are not exclusive or elitist; they are open to anyone interested in participating. They are not focused on showcasing individual expertise but rather on fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment where everyone's contributions are valued.

Overall, Gatherings aim to provide a platform for meaningful discussions, learning, and networking within the SuperBenefit community.

## Purpose of Gatherings

The purpose of SuperBenefit Gatherings is to serve as dynamic spaces for strategic exploration, knowledge sharing, partnership building, and ongoing community engagement at SuperBenefit. Through participatory discussions on topics like grant-making and impact investing, Gatherings contribute to a collective understanding of key themes. Emphasizing flexibility and adaptability, Gatherings integrate seamlessly with the core project strategy, providing continuity in discussions and community engagement.

### Objectives

**Exploration of Strategic Directions:** Gatherings serve as a platform for exploring and defining strategic directions for the Reimagining Power project. Discussions within Gatherings aim to identify key themes and goals that align with the project's overarching objectives.

**Knowledge Sharing and Learning:** Through participatory grant-making, impact investing, and discussions on challenges in philanthropy, Gatherings facilitate knowledge sharing and learning. Team members engage in conversations that contribute to a collective understanding of these topics and their relevance to the project.

**Building Partnerships:** Gatherings play a role in building partnerships by connecting with external organizations and individuals. The team envisions Gatherings as opportunities to engage early adopters and emerging tech builders in meaningful conversations, fostering collaboration and potential funding relationships.

### Guiding Principles

**Flexibility and Adaptability:** A key purpose of Gatherings is to provide flexibility and adaptability within the project. The team acknowledges the evolving nature of ideas and topics, allowing the Salons to serve as dynamic spaces where discussions can germinate and take shape over time.

**Integration with Core Project Strategy:** Gatherings aim to integrate seamlessly with the core strategy of the Reimagining Power project. By aligning salon discussions with the broader project strategy, the team ensures cohesiveness and synergy in pursuing project goals.

**Continuity and Community Engagement:** Gatherings contribute to the continuity of discussions, emphasizing that they are not one-time events but ongoing forums for convening, learning, and imagining together. This approach fosters a sense of community engagement and ensures that the project's narrative is continually developed and refined.

## Coordination

Gatherings are coordinated within the Community Experience workstream at SuperBenefit, and made available to its peers and projects as a network good.

### Roles

Several roles have authority to operate the Gatherings initiative. These roles come with some basic responsibilities and eligibility considerations to ensure that the Gatherings project remains useful to everyone who needs it. You can obtain a role by asking a Community Experience Steward.

- Community facilitators who help guests and attendees may request the **Community Weaver** role.

- Managers of social media accounts and streaming destinations may request the **Media Manager** role.

- Stewards of SuperBenefit projects and network peers who are using the Gatherings program for a strategic purpose may request the **Gathering Stewards** role, allowing them to collaborate on the governance of the Gatherings initiative:
  - Stewards are expected to uphold the initiative's purpose and operate/iterate based on the practices laid out in this documentation.
  - Gatherings Stewards are responsible for making sure that this documentation and all related artifacts are up-to-date.

### Other Resources & Tools

We're assembling a variety of resources for contributors to use when running their events and programs. These basic resources should help participants run their various programs without duplicated effort, and with greater consistency and predictability than could be achieved by running several, separate programs.

Most resources (such as roles, funds, information, etc.) can be accessed by contacting a Community Experience Steward. Most tools can be accessed by Steward approval via a Community Admin.

> Resources are organized into layers, allowing programs to use one or more processes within the Gatherings initiative, swapping in their own workflows and tooling as needed.

## Progress Tracking

### Ideas for Salon topics

**From @michellebaldwin.eth**

Others likely have experience in these areas. We could host a salon series. **@Filsan** & **@MBaldwin** keen on supporting this.

- Menzies Foundation - partnership for web3 salons with the ecosystem in Australia 
- Participatory grantmaking - discussed **@suesnider** 
- Participatory investing/impact investing - discussed **@Filsan** **@traceyr** **@Lewwwk** experience 
- Impact attestations - discussed pulling in **@Ashraf.Impactrio** & **@Karim** if keen and linked to AIFS discussion 
- Restorying power - **⁠restorying-power** **@duara** **@heenal** 
- Inequities and coordination challenges in philanthropy using the current doc as a jumping off point
  - These could have whatever stakeholders extend invites to their networks and then we could identify some who may have some experience using an equity lens
- Met with Ben West yesterday and he is doing research and an upcoming virtual conference series through his role with Ethereum Foundation - on blockchain enabled climate solutions - he is sending some more info 

**From @yeoro.eth**

- Place based experiments in community capital allocation for sporting infrastructure has come up in AIFS

**From @heenal.eth**

- A crypto & climate salon would be interesting and could draw in different folks. Timing might be good with the bull run coming up.
- I met with André from PFC (Philanthropic Foundations of Canada) yesterday who is organizing their conference and he encouraged us to submit a proposal for a web3/RPP session/salon. This would be under the "emerging trends track" and not the digital track which is more focused on 101 level introductory sessions.

### DAOs and Philanthropy Salon

The DAOs and Philanthropy Salon is an opportunity for early visionaries in the philanthropic landscape exploring web3 and DAOs to convene, learn and imagine together.

Language from OTF agreement:

> Increased awareness of the DAO model and its application in philanthropy and non-profit work.
>
> 1. Host a funder specific convening.
>
> 2. Host 1 DAOs and Philanthropy Salon
