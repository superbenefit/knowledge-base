# All In For Sport DAO Salon Series - Final Retrospective

This document captures the final retrospective of the AIFS DAO Salon Series using the Loved/Lacked/Learned/Longed For framework.

## LOVED - What are we grateful for?
*What worked beautifully? What felt alive and true? What surprised us in the best way? What felt like a gift? What do we want to carry forward?*

- **Poetic Harvesting** summarizing the overall space discussion was the perfect touch for those along all of the workshop levels to plug into.

- We created space for sharing, learning and questioning. This allowed for those along all of the workshop levels to plug into.

- Team collaboration was epic and distributed according to strengths.

- I liked that we had experts on each topic but were also humble enough to discuss complex topics in an approachable way.

- Bringing in voices of new people and those joining the gatherings.

- The format worked well and the consistency meant that by the end crafting the flow for each gathering felt easy.

- Internal team cohesion, trust, and sense of shared purpose.

- Registration process was clean and clear.

- Clear planning and agendas with well-defined roles and timing.

- Excellent tech support.

- The social media amplification was really well done with images, engagement tactics.

- Blend of arts - music, poetry is not always done with sports so it's a interdisciplinary approach.

- We had such great teamwork and communications, any coordination was treated as part of the creative jazz, not a hierarchical structure, that's the core for good things taking shape.

- Poetic Harvesting touched me, I'm glad of spirit it embodies into the activity as AIFS works to be more than some live music into the activity in 432hz which can shift a sense of expansion.

## LACKED - What did we need more of?
*What gaps did we notice? What didn't quite come together? What felt unfinished? Where did we fall short?*

- Better use of the relationship database, I've offered guests on November we had for the last gathering, and I think with a better order for example: we all input potential guests, and we choose a date to filter TOGETHER, I think I had expectations of making more things together, not because we cannot do it alone, but because the fun part of exchanging knowledge and feedback during a filter of guests.

- I think at the end we overlapped a little of that energy by not having in consideration that relationship database, therefore this is more a call to use more the tools we agreed on use like Charmverse for upcoming potential guests, we will be able to gather better information for tweets and weavers.

- The formats changed slightly as we developed the series. I would like to know which format resonated best for all, and make that the format moving forward.

- If we are to do more, I think the topics and speakers would need to be secured much further in advance to allow for proper marketing and promotion.

- We need a verified tweeter account/warpcast presence, on tweeter to reach potential onboarders, on warpcast to reach potential guests/quality listeners.

- JOSE this point is already here under "learned".

- Thank you Heenal!

- We didn't get as much participation from OTF or Jumpstart as I had hoped. It would have been great to see more support there.

- I think we had a lot of builders in the space who were excited about what we are doing. I would like to capture this momentum and interest better.

- Lacked a landing page for participants to see the latest gathering notes, harvests, videos, etc.

- Not much ongoing conversation on Discord outside of the gatherings.

- Social media strategy to share out learning and content after could have been a useful amplification and storytelling strategy.

- Hoped for the "funders" to be more engaged - lack of engagement feels a bit like old patterns of funders not seeming themselves in the "work" and "community".

- Unclear how effective social strategy was.

- Could have been a good opportunity to have someone from outside of AIFS on the gatherings hosting team.

## LEARNED - What insights will stay with us?
*What shifted our thinking? What unexpected lessons showed up? What challenged us in a good way? What will shape how we move forward?*

- The current use of twitter is not good, because we only do 1-3 tweets, and that caused many of the AIFS gatherings tweet get a punishment of visibility, I think our twitter had 0 impact on this round.

- Suggestions: put the links of the tweet, use 3 hashtags, use a picture on the first tweet and tag 10 people (or contributors).

- To be honest I do think it can be done WAY better.

- AIFS is getting known both in web3 and the sports community is growing worlds together.

- Inspired by the work in Costa Rica and would love to explore collaborating with these folks.

- More analysis of learnings in between each gathering would be nice, as Merri said gathering data about what are we doing with that data?

- The need for this type of cross sector bridging in the wild resonated strongly with many. For me it shows we are on the right track!

- Reaching out to speakers showed a level of interest and excitement about AIFS in general. If we hadn't done these, I would have never reached out to these groups.

- Use of real stories for those who shared.

- Support for some of the folks connected to gatherings got invited to participate on Twitter showed a sense of social connection and reciprocity.

## LONGED FOR - What do we dream of next?
*What do we want to build on? What's calling to be explored? What bigger possibilities are emerging? What would take this to the next level? What's the next step on this path?*

- Would love to do an actual project with a partner over the course of the gatherings series, we have a Tech24/5, policy but anything that actually works.

- We need a web3 safety gathering, it would be a cool thing but anything that actually works.

- We book a bunch of Og's and natives who got hacked, to hear they story, it's important to note they did NOTHING wrong, but we know this is the BEST way to raise awareness.

- Continuing to connect the dots with the Tech24/5.

- Amplification and wise saving and storytelling of what was learned, partners and what is next.

- Plan a Harvesting Strategy ahead of time and have a dedicated Harvesting Team to capture, process and share learnings.

- Tie THE gatherings space for those in Tech24/5.

- Look for new opportunities to build and grow with our community. Open up working calls and test/develop projects.

- Local gatherings on spanish where I noticed the sports quality of professionals on soccer/football academies has some potential I see for regular local gatherings/local onboarding for sports web3.
