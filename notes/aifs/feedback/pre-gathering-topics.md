# All In For Sport DAO Salon Series - Pre-Gathering Topic Interests

This document captures the topics, challenges, and interests shared by participants prior to the DAO Salon Series gatherings.

## What topics are you most interested in, related to the intersection of web3/emerging technology x sport for social change?

- Democratized and trust based funding models so we can tap into a different role of getting $ to the ground.
- Knowledge transfer (from the community) to peer groups.
- Opportunities to articulate/discuss how Web3 has the potential to change the game and disrupt more traditional approaches to social impact.
- Transitioning NGO models into the digital landscape for scalability of impact.
- Increasing base knowledge of Web3 through use case studies.
- Demystifying the concerns/legalities/regulation.
- Sustainability - how can we take more sustainable measures for the future of Web3. How can we connect communities further (i.e. fan engagement, AI, etc.). Case Studies - i.e. taking big organizations like FIFA and seeing how to technology could have maybe curbed the scandal.
- Development of a physical space to interact intimately with our donors/community partners/funds to engage and making things happen (together and separately).
- Community governance - models for consistent reporting/unlocking additional resources/peer support.

## What challenges/obstacles are you/org experiencing in your work that emerging tech could help address? Or, as a reframe, what successes could emerging tech accelerate?

- The negative environmental impact of blockchain as a barrier to current use.
- The assumed connection between blockchain as an infrastructure and the fear of crypto as a speculative currency.
- More efficient participatory decision making processes.
- Social finance and raising money - innovative solutions to decrease cost of sport.
- Impact and progress around positioning sports engines for generational impact.
- Building, supporting and coordinating global movements around gender justice in sport.
- Networks (female identifying coaches and leaders across the country).
- More transparent relationships/practices with governance, granting, investing, practices.
- Community governance and agency/ownership of operations.
- Building an effective agency to advance progress through a local lens in an efficient and effective manner.

## What topics/themes do you feel could really move the sector/sectors forward?

- Community governance and agency/ownership of operations.
- Collaborative models of development - how do we create assets and resources for collective impact/learning.
- Raising of money and the flow of money, how can Web3 technology support a more democratized and community owned way of global north donors deciding on priority funding areas and then releasing money based on their own interests.
- How can a sports organization/NGO start/get setup, which platforms etc.

## What stakeholders would be important to invite? What type of audience are we looking to have curate/invite?

- Decision makers who could support/scale the work.
- Youth (female identifying) in technology & sport.
- Philanthropic leaders who are looking to reconstruct their own practice (this is NOT the majority).
- Corporate funders - to help understand the priority in investment this can be, and the impact that is possible through a new funding approach.
- Government partners/stakeholders - we work a lot with DPR/school districts in the USA - and I think they are also thinking a lot about these concepts, but similarly haven't found the right solution yet - so would be good to share/learn together.
- Community-based orgs who may have an interest and the bandwidth to explore web3.
- Blockchains and blockchain foundations.

## What would be the objectives of these gatherings? How could we keep the momentum going?

- Knowledge transfer and movement building.
- Opportunity to meet and exchange with people.
- To learn something new, maybe we could have something like "Fact of the gathering..." (like fun fact of the day) or do polls/quizzes (short Kahoot/s) to keep everyone involved and learning!
- Build a network map?
- Could break into groups based on the knowledge levels of blockchain (beginner, middle, advanced).
- Actionable ideas and concepts being put into motion.
- Connecting in a discord channel in between for sharing of ideas, resources, learning in between sessions.
- Having a clear objective is really important.

## What outcomes would we like to see? As a collective and as individual orgs and as individuals?

- Collaborations and aligned projects.
- My hope is to see the beginnings of an impact network forming. A support system for those doing the work at all levels of the continuum.
