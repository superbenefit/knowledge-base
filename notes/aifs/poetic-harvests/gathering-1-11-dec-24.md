# AIFS Gathering 1 - 11 Dec 24

Welcome welcome everyone
To All In For Sport gathering number one
As people are streaming in
We're dreaming in
Fresh starts within
Our sector and beyond

Middle of the week, end of the year
We're all feeling it, let's persevere
We're wearing many hats
Shifting roles like acrobats
Before we get too far in, let's see
What's YOUR experience with web3?
some of us are new, some are in deep
We're all here to share, we're here to seek
Moving beyond ideas to "what can we actually do"
How can we leverage tech when we collaborate, me and you

From backgrounds of philanthropy
We're exploring new technology
There is an opportunity 

What are the levers we can find and rearrange
Within entire systems to spark real change?
Let's shift power from centralized entities to communities
Mobilize capital collectively, equitably
Open source playbooks will help others try
To replicate experiments under a different sky
Weaving networks, bringing knowledge alive
Open source sharing helps communities thrive

So many tools and technologies make up web3
We don't have time to explore them all deeply
But each has the potential to make us more free
Or, if we let them, to entrench inequity
Colonialism, patriarchy, capital's old hold
We must do more than simply retell stories of old
Not just incremental, superficial change
But entrenched systems of power must be rearranged

In this project we're using novel tools
Making our own systems, inventing new rules
We have no product to sell, no memecoin to shill
Simply systems to reimagine and a world to rebuild
Starting from the question: "What do communities need?"
Knowing that, with support, every court can dream

Sport for development and not only leisure
Real impact that we can feel and measure
Community, learning, co-creation, and pleasure
Shaping the direction of web3 - that's a lot of pressure 
But we don't lose faith, we never say never
Repurposing, reimagining - from trash to treasure
The acceleration of a better world, together
The acceleration of a better world, together
