# AIFS Gathering 4 - 5 Feb 25

The fabric of our entire world is changing 
Politics and technology are converging


We need a new wave of innovation
Like minded people in collaboration
Mutual free association
Community owned implementation
We're coming together with a shared passion
The world's wealth should not be rationed
Let us fashion
the kind of world we want to see
What mechanisms do we need 
to support projects led by community 
That make people more free
And create a brighter future for humanity
We're Digging into 
what communities need
and how technology 
can help to pull levers and support
Projects that empower through sport

W're exploring Local decision making, Co-ordination at scale
Equitable access to capital, Community governance that won't fail
Let us share knowledge, and connect
Help each other and seed new projects
building resilience through the power of sport
Let ai write our emails, grants, reports
Do routine tasks and get our kids to school
so we can spend our time dreaming big
Reimagining how we all could live


AI agents are more than just chat
They can do much more react
They decide what to, take actions onchain
They may not have a brain 
But they have memory and intention
They can craft pathways beyond human comprehension
They can help give power back to the people
Countering financial and governmental institutions' domination
An onchain primitive for recognition and reputation
A trusted Social Oracle of connections and attestations
There are so many friction points to mass coordination
But Agents could help onboard people into the web3 space
 in a way that's safe
We can do it all on base
Or on any chain
Our collective brain
Is bigger than the earth
Each word we utter has worth

Let AI democratize
And Synthesize 
Let us see with new eyes
And Listen with new ears
Let us put aside our fears
And free ourselves from the overwhelm of information
No more super-siloed isolation
our goal is to really help to share resources and knowledge
No need for bloated toolkits
That are rarely a good fit
When swarms can curate and create knowledge in real-time
An agent for your community, an agent for mine
Bringing together insights new so solutions can shine

AI content should not be flagged,
It should be celebrated!
You should be congratulated
for not having duplicated
Work already done, for avoiding waste
But in our haste
We have criminalized efficiency 
And built of world of deficiency
Not reciprocity

Yes, we're playing catch-up
We don't have billions to drop
The space is so scary
We *should* be wary
The systems that we make
Mustn't be opaque
If we don't open-source
We're opening the doors
to manipulation
This is a battle for the future of information
Centralization vs free association
censorship vs cross-pollination
We fight together
In service of a shared vision
We don't have to start yet another DAO
When agents have the knowhow
To seek out
Answers wherever they may be found

We invite every dreamer, creator, and friend
To shape a network whose impetus knows no end.
Together let's build an impact network
for social impact through sport
Let us Create Connection, Spark Collaboration
and Catalyze Systemic Change across every nation
Let's build a worldwide coordi-nation
Together Let's build a coordi-nation
