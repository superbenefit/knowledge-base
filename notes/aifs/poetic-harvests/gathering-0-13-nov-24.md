# AIFS Gathering 0 - 13 Nov 24

Hello friends old and new
Welcome to our core group, our crew

For being part of session zero
Each one of us is a hero

We come from many an organization, many a place
We come together to co-explore this space
Where web3 and sport and impact meet
Through 5 gatherings over the next 12 weeks

What are we most excited to explore?
Who do we hope will walk through the door?
Who could be there to share and present?
What kind of support makes this time well spent?

Although we each may play different roles
From our varied backgrounds we share some goals
An impact network we aspire to nurture
Through regenerative digital infrastructure

Infrastructure of imagination
Unified through coordination
Collective intelligence and social innovation
Crafting new futures through collaboration

Sport for the people, by the people

Turning priorities upside down
Putting community voices at the crown
Building up from the ground

When participatory methods expand, they fail
How do we unlock and operate at scale?

When tech serves the values we hold dear and true
It drives success for the community, and the world too

We need use cases, examples that are clear
We need to put community leaders at the frontier
They know best what their people need
Let's get them the funds and let them lead
The issue isn't lack of capital, it's capital flows
how the capital moves and where it goes

Community governance and inclusion we seek
Shared decision-making where every voice can speak
In a phygital space where worlds combine
Demystifying web3 with an open mind

Building and supporting movements worldwide
Gender justice in sport, with our values as our guide
Mobilizing knowledge, a movement we'll start
Crafting new futures with mind and heart

What becomes possible at this intersection
Of tech and values when we forge connections
Radical hospitality, relationships we weave
Dreaming and acting together, we believe

Anchored care and emergent strategy in play
Cross-generational work lights the way
Collective liberation our shared destination
At this crossroads, we spark innovation

Excited to be here, we've already learned a lot
Building the plane as we fly, giving all we've got
This space is still being designedâ€”and we get to design it!
We're not here to sell anything but to align and refine it

That's what sport does, right? Brings us together
A global community, bound forever
Now we can use our love for sports to act
Creating social impact where more will interact
So others will listen, embrace the call
United in purpose, we rise for all

We're hear because we want to be, because we must
Thank you for giving this group your time and your trust
There's so much to learn, so much to discuss
Come, jump down the rabbit hole with us
