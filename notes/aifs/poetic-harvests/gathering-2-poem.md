# AIFS Gathering 2 Poem

Welcome to our Gathering number two
With sweet melodies to greet you

Why are we here today, what's on our minds?  
We're connecting technology and sports
to serve humankind
Exploring how community can guide
We seek a shift far and wide
So much wisdom already out there 
What can we learn, what can we share
We seek fresh approaches to center local voice
Place-based power, ownership, reimagining choice
Breaking from institutions inflexible and old
Inventing new frameworks, courageous and bold
How can shared governance shift systems at large
Transparent, connected, with communities in charge?

This is a space of dialogue and exploration
To kickstart ideas and conversations 
Through artful facilitation 
Impact measurement and evaluation 
Development and innovation
To enable scaleable coordination
Building on the orientation
To see how this could be a good fit for my organization

We share a love for new governance models
We're volunteers, future seers
Pioneers with rock star peers
Growing our tribe
Finding new allies 
To connect, learn and ideate, we co-create
A more equitable space in sport
Thriving by combining sport and tech
Where the most impacted have ownership
Over decisions and resource allocation
A shift is happening 
now it's time for its acceleration

We challenge ourselves to think bigger
Talking on this challenge with rigor and vigor
We could do so much more 
With Community at the core
We're making much more than a place to play
Lifting the community every day
Sports spaces can be platforms
for sustainable social change
This requires community ownership
as well as access to play

Development led by community
And not by the ones with money
Development that serves real need
Development that plants a seed
In service of human flourishing
Not human greed

Continuing linear growth won't lead
To every community's potential being freed
Together, we can scale
and we will succeed
A challenge we face is effective communication
And collecting comprehensive information
As well as the digital maturity of the community 
How can we serve as many people as possible?
What would it take to become unstoppable?

We need to forge a culture of decentralization
A societal commitment to equity and regeneration
There are systems of oppression throughout philanthropy
DAOs live in the shadows of patriarchy
How are we perpetuating imbalances in power?
What's a new way that could bloom and flower?
What community governance models
can unlock how we shift power
And how we reimagine value flow?
The corridors of power are so narrow!
Low resource groups - where do they go?
So much to discover
so much we can't yet know

And so we gather to shift the norm
Sparking fresh ideas that can transform
A thinker's space
A brave new place
With each shared step
we spark new light
A shift's underway
but it won't happen overnight
We need to engage!
it's a process, a journey indeed!
Let's practice together
Let's fill each other's needs

This is just the beginning
But already, it feels like we're winning
Thank you for being part of this conversation
Ever onward we go, in shared exploration.
