# Outline

- There are two main fronts for blockchain implementation: connecting donors with communities and managing community resources. Blockchain can provide transparency, governance, and traceability in community projects.

- The implementation would start with communities that have a high level of digital maturity.

- The goal is to explore how blockchain can function at the community level before positioning Love Football as an intermediary.

- The use of blockchain could unlock new opportunities for communities, including better funding and operation support.

- The project would involve an initial exploration phase to understand the community engagement process and the flow of projects from inception to completion.

- The aim is to develop a system that can be tested and then built upon to create a scalable vision for Love Football's methodology.

Governance System and Blockchain Technology

- Chiliz has developed a new governance system on their blockchain

- The project scope is kept narrow and clear, focusing on understanding the background processes of community engagement and project flow.

- The team plans to create a cell within All in for Sport titled 'Love Futbol Chiliz Experiment' to manage the project.

- The project will have its own community governance, allowing participants collectively decide how things move forward and how funds are allocated.

- Specialists in governance will be brought in to understand the needs and to help build the project.

- The project is not committed to always being with Chiliz blockchain and aims to be flexible in choosing the best blockchain(s) for the project moving forwards

Exploration of Blockchain and Web3 Space

- The goal is to create a plug-and-play solution that can be offered to communities with the necessary digital maturity.

- The team is considering reaching out to communities that have shown digital maturity to begin the conversation.

- The team is seeking guidance on whether they need someone well-versed in product development or if a general understanding of blockchain would suffice.

- The team is assessing how long it would take for their operations team to gather the necessary information.

Monetization of Volunteer Hours

- The team is exploring ways to monetize volunteer hours in their projects.

- They are looking to pilot something similar with La Liga, focusing on incentive-driven contributions. The goal is to explore how to monetize contributions and recognize the importance of community effort in building spaces.

- They are considering how to provide incentives without overly incentivizing, aiming for a balance that encourages community engagement.

- The team believes that recognizing contributions could be a game-changer for community engagement in the United States. They are working with their team in Brazil to explore monetization strategies and are trying to connect with Courtney to ensure supports are in place.

- The team is exploring the use of a micro-economy within the community to promote internal economy and attract new partners.

Basketball Court Project in Brazil

- The team is working on a basketball court project in Brazil, collaborating with Trevor Wagner (??).

- They are trying to loop Trevor in for more projects and are using him for content creation and storytelling.

- The project involves creating multi-sport spaces, including basketball and soccer, to align with community norms.

- The team is excited about the momentum in the innovation space and the potential for IOC funding. They are proud of the strides made in their strategic plan and the digital transformation strategy presented by Leo.

- The team recognizes the significance of digital tools in amplifying the impact of their work and is committed to building it authentically.
