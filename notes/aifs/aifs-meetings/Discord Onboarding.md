Goal is to set up a polished onboarding experience for those coming from the IOC Tech365 Explore Program.

Office Hours, clear onboarding flow. 


# First update



after figuring out that discord has some glitches on the onboarding flow i was able to save changes, it told me there was something wrong on the post-question section and the mistake was in the first part, wich was that some channels that needed to be public we're not, and that was messing things a little.

# onboarding

welcome message had grammar issues, it says "Hi \[@username\]! We're a community dedicated top supporting Community-Driven Sports Projects. Complete the tasks below to get full access to membership and features."

i changed t "top supporting" to "to support" and if there's any suggestions on what do you want to see on the welcome message  drop them here!  ✅

Quest channel is deleted also any reference to quest on the onboarding flow and mee6 embeeds :   ✅

resources channel added for newcomers, ✅  btw  i will check that resource you share there in a minute!

so far seeing discord onboarding videos, seeing the current settings and studying potential suggestions

any ideas you want to incorporate? any channels/roles we want to delete?

i will be working on some ideas to share here to add to the flow today aswell


 i have on my notes i have  "Add Resources channel to onboarding flow Add info about gatherings"  should i share the general https://lu.ma/aifs and give a brief about it? as we're on discussion about upcoming gatherings without an official future date i wonder what it's best
