## Agenda

- before ask for grant, explore if there is alignment

- start with high level overview of AIFS. experiments =

  - fundraising

  - community governance. safe, snapshot, hats, charverse

  - cross-border transfers

  - impact attestations - hypercerts, karma gap, EAS

  - playbooks

  - ethereum localism

## Questions to Consider

### Strategic Alignment

- How does Chiliz see its long-term vision beyond fan tokens and elite sport?

- Is working with grassroots sport and local communities around the world part of that roadmap?

- What kinds of builders or partners is Chiliz most excited to support right now?

- Where are the "win-wins", the areas of natural alignment, the overalp that adds value to your work and ours in some way

### Integration Fit

- What DApp tooling or primitives already exist on Chiliz, and what are in the process of being built?

- Are there developer teams working on non-token use cases?

- What is the easiest way to build or experiment on Chiliz right now? Is there a grants + infra + devrel bundle?

### Partnership Willingness

- Is Chiliz interested in funding _experiments_ that bring new governance models onto the chain?

- Would you support a pilot that's grounded in a local sports space and includes governance tooling, community onboarding, and open-source learnings? Are there specific aspects of this where you have more interest than others?

- Are there other chains or Layer 2s you're collaborating with where a hybrid deployment might make sense?

### ‚öíÔ∏è Low-Lift Collaborations

- Are there existing contracts, templates, or fan token mechanics that could be adapted for grassroots sports communities?

- Could we pilot with no code/smart contract dev at first (e.g. using existing DAO tooling on other chains)?

- is Chiliz interested in partnering around fundraising, using their tokens and digital asset economies to generate funding back to grassroots communities where professional teams are based?

### Feedback Loop

- How do you learn from the experiments you fund? What do you expect in return - case studies, media, GitHub repos?

# Minutes

### üîπ Attendees

- **Chiliz**: Altug (Greenhouse + Governance), Sebastian (Corporate/Public Affairs)

- **All In For Sport**: Shannon, Heenal

---

### üîπ Key Points Discussed

#### ‚úÖ Shared Interests

- Both teams are aligned on the need for **community governance**, **grassroots funding mechanisms**, and **public goods infrastructure**.

- Chiliz is working on a **DAO tooling stack**, including Gnosis Safe and Aragon DAO stack, to be ready by \~May 2025.

- **Greenhouse** (microgrant program) and a **larger grant stream** are Chiliz‚Äôs two main pathways for funding.

- Chiliz is piloting their model internally (Greenhouse DAO) and preparing to pitch it to FC Barcelona.

#### ‚úÖ AIFS Context Shared

- Past and current experiments include JuiceBox (Alaska), court refurbishments (Philippines), crypto rail funding pilots, impact attestations (Hypercerts), governance tooling, and Ethereum Localism.

- Reimagining Power Project and Tech 365 cohorts provide a strong peer network (25+ orgs) and funder alignment (Atkinson, Equality Fund, Women Win, etc.)

#### ‚úÖ Potential Pilot

- Possible pilot with **love.f√∫tbol** in Brazil: aligning well with Chiliz‚Äôs market priorities and interest in Common Goal collaborations.

- Brasil also happens to be the country where Chiliz has the biggest presence

- Additional funding could come from Tech 365 and possibly Common Goal via Chiliz.

- A"small pilot to start with could involve the research and design of a governance-related experiment in a community that love.futbol works with in Brazil. This funding could also enable the continuation of the Gatherings program, which Altug and Seb expressed support for.


#### ‚úÖ Ecosystem Building

- AIFS‚Äôs ongoing gatherings and community-building efforts (Tech 365) could become part of Greenhouse ecosystem support for builders and non-technical contributors.

## üìù Next Steps / Action Items

### üî∏ All In For Sport

- Consider a **Greenhouse application** to support ongoing gatherings and impact network building.

- Create a one-pager detailing a possible project

### üî∏ Chiliz (Altug)

- Await one-pager for review and iterate if needed

- Continue prepping DAO tooling (Safe complete, Aragon OS in \~2 months)

- Greenhouse expected to **publicly launch end of April**

## üìå Opportunities to Track

- FC Barcelona pilot ‚Äî possible case study alignment

- Common Goal ‚Äî as another funding stream for Web3-aligned projects

- Jumpstart (Canadian Tire) ‚Äî potential longer-term collaboration on token-driven governance/funding

- Huttoja community (Venezuela) ‚Äî another informal case study on impact and equity
