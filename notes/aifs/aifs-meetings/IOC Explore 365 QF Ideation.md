> Let's use this space to begin to have an outline for how AIFS could potentially assist the IOC in the distribution of funds for the Tech365 Explore program

- What mechanisms will AIFS need to assist groups looking to raise capital?

- What would the IOC need in terms of risk management?

- What knowledge can we share with the IOC around why this is a unique opportunity?

- What are some MVP's that AIFS can use to assist the funding allocations that are small tests to lead towards bigger projects.

-  mentioned creating a local node, build our AIFS ecosystem, what would allow for AIFS to become a trusted party to vouch for sport for good projects?
