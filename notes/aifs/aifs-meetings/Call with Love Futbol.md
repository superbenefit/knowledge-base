## Meeting Notes

Small, growing team of 22 full-time + 34 part-time. Just inaugurated their 81st sports space.

story... Guatemala - Villa Nueva. Without community buy-in, a project won't be successful. They went back to the community 10 year later and it was even more beautiful

grass-roots origins. grew organically over 18-19 years. as we go, learning from communities how to approach these projects. not cookie cutter projects - each sports space is unique.

Want each space to be locally owned, locally controlled, self sustaining. And also see a role for LF as a facilitator and guide. And also - how can we enable peer learning? And how can we leverage resources to ensure that resources are truly community owned and controlled?

Leo came on to work with LF as a digital consultant. 

- they want to make their fundraising process smarter

- they want to engage their communities in smarter ways

but they don't need a big behemoth solution to everything

Main digital interventions they're looking at:

- How can they continue to deliver services to communities without additional team capacity

- How to provide additional training and capacity to communities so that they don't need to grow the team further (virtual peer learning)

- How to share learning from people who are running a sports space successfully - facilitating a sense of community across the LF network

- How to get donors more actively engaged in the social impact work - in a thoughtful and respectful relationship, a mutual sense of joy and respect for play

Example project they're working on: a platform for donors to learn more about individual projects. And then they can make an additional donation to a project if they want.

Current handover plan... looks different in different countries. "community network" of community leaders, with different "community captain" roles. 

possible areas for exploration

- funding mechanism
