# Feedback from Jos√©:

**Tokensmart**: This is the first nft hub ([https://discord.gg/nft](https://discord.gg/nft) ) wich is essentially a web3 native space where we have 5+ years hosting live activities, we can book our stakeholders and aligned projects here in our intend to connect our stakeholders and partners with a broader web3 audience that is aligned with long term visions.

they have a **multi streaming tool** for these type of spaces and they can be our partners in highlighting npo's and impact org's with an organic web3 native community


this in reference to what we can do as next step once we have stakeholders interested into exploring the space and get to know more about the ecosystem and it's users.


**Hand Protocol**: This is a project i helped to summon with other web3 natives and we have been able to channel positive impact to NPO's and activist by providing costumized onboarding and guidance on the intersection of web3 x impact 

here is the first two updates of hand protocol:

[https://paragraph.xyz/@hand/hand-protocol-a-month-of-progress-ent002](https://paragraph.xyz/@hand/hand-protocol-a-month-of-progress-ent002)

we talked today about the different impact concerts I have been able to make as an independent artist and I shared how i visualized hand protocol into the onboarding procces and the call to action is see if this is a project you might see aligned with the overall goals we can have during the season

so far our alignment was in fuction of AIFS gatherings, in upcoming calls we can chat about other areas of interest for our roadmap.


**Guests list:** I have interviewed and shared spaces with quality web3 natives, once we get to work on the sheet we discussed to organize tentative speakers and invite them for the AIFS calls. I will provide further detail about them and i can reach out those we're looking to have as guests

**Impact Concerts:** this is a [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Kczqq721jili6e1xD0F5uK3tnAovTnUPXEHN4mZc3g/edit?tab=t.0) for web3 impact projects, it shows the overall of how an impact concert on discord will work, the overall proposal shows how tokensmart and hand protocol are interconnected into the idea of an impact concert on discord streamed across platforms and making the call to action of setup a wallet and create impact projects/donate on them.





# Notes from Shannon:

The goal for each session will be to have participants leave with a "next step" to join the discord and continue the conversation with our groups. Avoid getting into the meetings of inaction cycle. 
Setting the tone for respect, embracing eveyones own unique process and human factor that they bring to the conversation. It's a space to learn and share and it will be natural to disagree or feel uncomfortable. Thats part of this process to truly understand where each group is coming from.

Solutions focus approaches rather than general crits are welcome.

Next Steps:

Work with the  to set up an onboarding buddy system. Whether it be a weekly sync, townhall or sorts to ensure everyone feels comfortable using discord.

Add potential speakers/collaborators into the  document

Work with  to develop a social media strategy. 

- event 'poster' with speakers

- timeline of posts for twitter, insta and LinkedIn tags of speakers and collaborators 

- identify who we will share with and how to cross promote
