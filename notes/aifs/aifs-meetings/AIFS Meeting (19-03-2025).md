## Transcripts

Meetings in the SuperBenefit discord can be transcribed with the [Scripty](https://scripty.org) bot. The following command will cause the bot to join the Cafe voice channel and begin transcribing:

```
/join voice_channel:#"cafe" create_thread:True target_channel:#cafe-transcripts record_transcriptions:True
```

## Summaries with ChatGPT

Scripty's transcripts aren't stellar, but they're good enough to feed into [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). The following prompt (created by ChatGPT) will usually create a suitable summary from Scripty's .txt file output:

```
Given the following transcript of a meeting between [participants] about [topic], provide a concise summary highlighting the main points, key arguments, and any notable insights discussed during the conversation. Make sure to capture the overall tone and key takeaways:
