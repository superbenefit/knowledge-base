>This document is WIP. The facilitation strategy for the DAO Primitives framework will be documented here.
This is a non-technical approach to facilitating the adoption of web3 tooling for experiments with polycentric governance and decentralized coordination mechanisms in digitally native organizations.
The purpose of this guide is to inform facilitators who are using the [DAO Primitives Framework](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/project/257) in their organizations.
# Context

- This facilitation strategy is intended to assist advisors, consultants, operators and governance facilitators in preparing their (or their clients') organizations for the adoption of, and experimentation with, DAO primitives in a principled and standards-compliant manner.

# Approach
