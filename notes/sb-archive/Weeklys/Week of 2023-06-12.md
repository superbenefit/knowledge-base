- Reimagine DAO experiment
	- Flowing funds through Reimagine Institute - do this with NFTs again? Or how?
		- OTF could get tokens to enable their participation in SB community governance - NOT directly controlling the project itself
			- Tracey is main contact for the grant. Doug is engaged as part of OTF.
		- The Primitive Cell can draft an overview of the structure to present to the next meeting
		- 
	- How does value flow in, what does contribution and reward look like
