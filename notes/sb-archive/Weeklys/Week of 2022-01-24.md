## Triage Items
What tensions do you have that need resolution to move forward in your work?
- I'd like to understand the setup of the SB multisig better... hoping we have time for a short discussion (Rowan)
	- How do we design this in a way so the people are protected?

	- Will discuss with BPetes and then action this

	- Will think about it.
- Not sure how to move the equity and impact work forwards. How to convene/coordinate? (Heenal)
	- Heenal will reflect and come by with a specific ask, if any.
- Not sure what to expect post-Mirror crowdfund. What foresight do other Leads have regarding how many new members we can expect, what they might be looking for in our Discord, and how to make them feel welcome? (Heenal)
	- I don't really know how it will work, but i would imagine we'd have a couple hundred people join the discord. Maybe more if it goes well. Maybe 1000? /shrug
	- We should have some ideas once we sort out the invitation and how people can participate.
	- Do we need a new project? Michael and Heenal 
- Any insights on how to increase engagement in Discord from GC past experience in other DAOs - MB
	- Resolved for now.
- Tidy up Clarity: pinned items, completed tasks & duplicates - Heenal
	- ACTION: Can everybody remove any pins that don't make sense for everyone, tidy up projects and tasks and suggest anything you think we all need?
- Purpose and governance for new roles - Mark
	- 2 new squad lead roles need to be formally proposed and then appoint people to those roles
	- @remarkk will make the proposal as a model for the future.
- Explore partnerships with [verses.xyz](https://verses.xyz) around pluriverse and crypto culture and society - Michael
	- Michael to have a call with the verses.xyz group and find out what help they need. There are strong links to the group already. Will follow-up with Michelle and Heenal.
	- On crypto culture and society educational institution: looking for a sponsor. Exploring that opportunity as well.
	- Michael to engage Alex and Rowan on the topic of partnerships as well. Partnerships role to be considered in Community Experience Squad
- The invitation to engage by the launch of the Crowdfund (Michael)
	- How can we engage people to participate in the landscaping? Michael to engage Alex and Rowan first, followed by Heenal and Michelle.
	- Possible dependency to communications and Peter's work.
- Does the hello world post link to crowdfund and if so would the details be in the post and what the 20ETH is being used for? (MB)
	- I think that the hello world post IS the crowdfund (correct)
	- it goes into our treasury, which is then allocated based on community proposals
	- treasury will hold the ETH and the SPRB
