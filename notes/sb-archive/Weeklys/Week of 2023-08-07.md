	- Blocked on workspace setup
- #[[P-261 Windfall - Residential Energy NFT]] 
	- Proposal outline to set up initial cell drafted
		- Could be a good pattern for future cells
	- Funding is always "imminent" :)
- #[[P-193 Community Experience- Revolution 1]]
	- try Quests for AIFS
		- can be good for bringing people into collaboration scale - eg token incentives for checking out Clarity 
		- have a more engaging onboarding experience with activities for people to do

## Triage/Discussion
- cell core team
	- what are the rights AND responsibilities of being in the core team?
	- what skillsets are needed?
	- who gets to decide?
		- For the Windfall proposal (and moving forwards?), list the initial core team members in the Proposal
	- spend some of first meeting time:
		- going through the cell state
		- getting clear on roles, responsibilities, rewards
			- There is space for these in the Cell Planning Doc: [https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/project/267](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/project/267)
