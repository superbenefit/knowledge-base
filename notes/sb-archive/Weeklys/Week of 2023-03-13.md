		- Testing web3 wallet at CFC
			- I did want to start the process of setting up a wallet for CFC, here are the steps I have identified: [https://www.circle.com/en/](/)-Meet with Director Finance and heads up to Chief Strategy Officer (doing that now :)
- Brief for Staff & Finance committee including opportunities, tax implications, risks and one page brief about climate impacts from Reimagine Co and SuperBenefit
- Decide if creating wallet for organization or using [circle.com](/) to transfer USDC which can be shared with wallets (issuer of USDC - onboarding good)
- If wallet for CFC decide who has access to the wallet key(s). Is this the CEO, FD, CSO, all of the above? Is it just a simple wallet or a multisig? Set thresholds (consider it like a debit account). If it's a multisig, how many signers, and who are the signers? Determine security processes for the wallet. eg is a hardware wallet (or wallets) to be used?
-Create organizational wallet for CFC
-Set up Newton. Banking info needed from finance
-Transfer fiat to Newton
-  Use fiat to buy USDC in Newton 
-Transfer USDC from Newton to other wallets as approved
