Here's the allocation result from the coordinape process. 
Personal reflection:
- The individual user view just shows where allocations were received from and any comments that were made by the giver.
- While the interface felt confusing and awkward, it does seem to produce a decent result.

Verdict: 
I recommend we continue to use it unless there are objections or another solution emerges. It should get easier and more effective with more of us having greater experience with it.
