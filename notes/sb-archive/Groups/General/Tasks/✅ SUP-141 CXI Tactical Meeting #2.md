	- Onboarding to SuperBenefit
		- Last Week: It feels a bit passive. I like the bot but it feels like we are missing the personal messages. feedback: not sure what I'm doing, what the onboarding process is, who's who. I got a much better idea at the Town Hall. Maybe an intro video would be helpful. Not sure what to look at, when you get in the channels it's very confusing.

			- FAQ in discord channel
			- weekly discord tutorial

			- asking people to do simple things in the beginning. see Community Commitment Curve
		- This Week
			- troubleshoot Clarity with Jai

### Tensions to Process
- Seek consensus on [Proposal to create new roles](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/work/120) 
- Lack of community engagement with ToC review process
- Discord roles/guilds still not updated

- Onboarding process for new members. Different tools are a lot to manage (not just a tech issue, although Clarity is challenging)
- Gatekeeping of Clarity 


### Closing Round
- The Facilitator invites each participant, one at a time, to share a closing reflection. No discussion.

# Tactical Meetings

Tactical meetings are focused on a teamâ€™s operational work. Their purpose is to triage issues that have come up recently and remove obstacles so that the work can move forward. (See: [https://www.holacracy.org/tactical-meetings](https://www.holacracy.org/tactical-meetings) ). They are not the meetings where the work itself gets done. We are focused on the most efficient way for the work to get unblocked.
Tactical Meetings for the #[[General Circle]] happen on a weekly basis. (Regular day/time TBD)
Tactical Meetings need a [[Secretary]] (scribe) and a [[Facilitator]]. All Circle members are invited to participate.
## Tactical Meeting Process
### Checkin Round
- The Facilitator invites participants, one at a time, to share a check-in to call out distractions and get present. No discussion.

### Surface Data
- **Checklist Items**: Recurring actions that require a status of "Check" or "No check" from each relevant role from the preceding period.
- **Metrics Review:** Roles assigned to report on a metric share the latest data. Clarifying questions only, no discussion.
- **Project Updates:** Facilitator goes through each project and asks for updates. The project owner responds with "no update" or shares what has changed since the last meeting.
	- Optional Project Update Structure:
		- **Last Week** - what was completed
		- **This Week** - what is to be completed
		- **Blockers** - an obstacle that needs to be addressed (usually identified as a tension to be triaged)
	- A Circle Member can also ask a project owner for a projection of completion of a project as a tension.

### Remove Barriers
- **Build Agenda:** Participants build the agenda of tensions to process, using one or two words per item as a reminder for the agenda-item-owner.
- **Triage Items:**
	- The [[Tension]] holder shares their tension.
	- Facilitator asks "What do you need to move your tension forward?"
		- Request for something to get something done (an action or a project)
		- Request data or advice
		- Request for attention to share information
		- Request for an ongoing expectation (governance change or agreement)
	- Secretary (scribe) captures accepted next-actions or projects

### Closing Round
- The Facilitator invites each participant, one at a time, to share a closing reflection. No discussion.
