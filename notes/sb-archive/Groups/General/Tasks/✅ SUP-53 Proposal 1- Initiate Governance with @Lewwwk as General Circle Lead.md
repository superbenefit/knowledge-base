## Background
A detailed description of an initial model for SuperBenefit DAO Governance has been shared on Discord. Please review that proposal at this link:  [https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/028deeaf-1370-4b8f-9cd4-3a6e26584dfe](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/028deeaf-1370-4b8f-9cd4-3a6e26584dfe) 
In order to instantiate this governance model, I am stepping into the role of Governance steward/facilitator/secretary. As described in the above document, the model proposed is initiated first by the appointment of a General Circle Lead, who then consents to operate by the principles, practices and processes described above.
## Proposal
I propose that @Lewwwk be appointed the first General Circle Lead.

My rationale for his fitness to this role comes from a number of key facts:
- @Lewwwk is clearly the prime mover and founder of the SuperBenefit initiative, and is sourcing its purpose and potential
- @Lewwwk has a comprehensive understanding of Web3, social finance and systems transformation that are essential in order to exercise the judgement required to guide SuperBenefit towards its purpose, particularly at this early stage
- @Lewwwk has a deep network and understanding of the capabilities required to successfully pursue SuperBenefit DAO's purpose, and is therefore in the best position to assess who is best fit for other Circle Lead roles

## Action
In making this Proposal publicly on Discord, I am seeking the consent of our emerging community to appoint @Lewwwk in this role, thereby conferring to him the legitimacy he will need in order to lead while remaining responsible to the purpose of SuperBenefit and accountable to its Contributors.****
