# Leverage Points
## 8 forms of leverage (from Rowan)
- Capital - does it scale the attraction or use of capital in new high leverage ways? (like Olympus et al)
- Labour - how does it scale the coordination and collaboration of individuals to participate in something in new and powerful ways?
- Technology - utilising technology to allow some novel highly valuable thing to scale (digital trust, scaling at zero marginal cost...)
- Network - are there network dynamics here that are going to drive the powerful scaling of something valuable (virality, bandwagon effects, the 13 different types of network effects)... etc
- Perceptual
- Product
- Media
- Strategic

It's important to keep in mind so that we bridge the gap between big abstracted ideas/vision and on-the-ground execution of powerful ideas that will actually work.

Place to intervene in a system (in order of influence)
- 12 Constants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards)
- 11 The sizes of buffers and other stabilising stocks, relative to their flows
- 10 The structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport networks, population age structures)
- 9 The lengths of delays, relative to the rate of system change
- 8 The strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against
- 7 The gain around driving positive feedback loops
- 6 The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to information)
- 5 The rules of the system (such as incentives, punishments, constraints)
- 4 The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organise the system structure
- 3 The goals of the system
- 2 The mindset or paradigm out of which the system—its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters—arises
- 1 The power to transcend paradigms

## Drivers of sustainability transformations: leverage points, contexts and conjunctures
- [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11625-021-00957-4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11625-021-00957-4) 
- Four features that are important for bringing clarity on how deliberate transformations can be encouraged:
	- (1) the function of drivers in enabling and restricting transformations of societal systems characterised by detailed or dynamic complexity, and through which specific governance mechanisms and interventions are operationalised
	- (2) the cultural and geographical contexts of transformations
	- (3) where in the systems the drivers are intended to intervene
	- (4) the role of critical junctions in time, where transformative trajectories can branch out.
- The COVID-19 crisis has brought the role of disruptors for sustainability transformations to the fore. Disruptors refer to occurrences that interrupt a system or a process from continuing as usual or as expected. Its Latin root means to break apart. A disruptor can be a technology, a political event, an environmental disaster, or a virus. In times of crisis, social structures and institutions are put to the test. Normal practices and habits are called into question. Disruptions can uproot and alter how we make sense of our world, how we behave, do business, do politics, learn, and go about our daily lives.
	- "In times of structural dislocation, ordinary routines of social life are open to doubt, the sanctions of existing power relations are uncertain or suspended, and new possibilities are thinkable. In ordinary times, cultural schemas, arrays of resources and modes of power are bound into self-reproducing streams of structured social action. But in times of dislocation … resources are up for grabs, cultural logics are elaborated more freely and applied to new circumstances, and modes of power are extended to unforeseen social fields."
