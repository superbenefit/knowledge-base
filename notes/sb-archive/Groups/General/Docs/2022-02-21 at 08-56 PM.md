## Welcome & Land Acknowledgment 
- MBaldwin, Community Experience squad and I am kicking us off and then other SuperBenefit community members will jump in to bring you a seamless and fun experience. If you are wondering who am I and why am I kicking us off, I just like you am curious about SuperBenefit and web3 and the way that I learn is by being all in and learning by doing, reading, talking with others. So here I am someone who has worked in nonprofit and philanthropy my whole life and know that there is an urgency for new systems and pathways. Being part of this has been 3 parts exhilirating and 1 part overwhelming. 
	- 
- The purpose for today is to get you up to speed on SuperBenefit, to share where we are at, and support you to plug in as much or as little as you want and can. A note that we are recording today to capture notes. 
- SuperBenefit has been on a wild ride which is about right given that web3 is a wild ride, it is early days and some of you have been shaping where this goes and others of you are wanting to get up to speed and jump in and others of you may still want to learn and lurk as they say. This is a choose your own adventure and what you hear today is most likely to change significantly for the better with your bright minds. If you know what SB is that is ok, that is what we are doing her today.
- I am calling in today from the traditional lands of the Anishinaabek, Haudenosaunee, Lūnaapéewak and Attawandaron peoples, on lands connected with the London Township and Sombra Treaties of 1796 and the Dish with One Spoon Covenant Wampum. We invite you to reflect on where you call in from today, we have people globally and what we know to be true is that the the opportunity in front of us with web3 for new collective futures, shared governance and ownership and co-creation are Indigenous ways of knowing and others of us have lost our way. So we are talking lots of about equity and decolonizing web3 and we know we are bringing our own bias and stuckness and have been and are committed to continuing to learning and unlearning. 
- Name and thank scribe, we have miro board for you add notes https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_llbEduw=/?moveToWidget=3458764516388776657&cot=14 
- Quick run through agenda - pop in chat the agenda
- Ask for what you need... If you have a question, ask in the cafe chat (which is above the cafe channel) at any time. If you need to step away for any reason, that's ok!
- Building in reflection into SuperBenefit is part of our DNA, Daniel who is also part of the Community Experience squad will be taking us through a reflection and meditation practice and I will turn it over to him
- Breakout - Get to Know One Another (groups of 6) 5:15 to 5:20
