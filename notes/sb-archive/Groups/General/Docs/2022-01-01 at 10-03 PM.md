## Agenda:
- Re-introductions
- Review Theory of Change
- Implications for the rest of the work

## Review Theory of Change: @AlexH 
- Alex made two PDF documents, building off the prior pencil sketch of change linking to an investment thesis
- The investment thesis is nested within a high level theory of change
- The way we're coming together around this has been emergent and has been communications led
- Trying to be concise, yet holistic
- If you get the words right in the TOC, this can support communications, graphics, etc
- A concept we were speaking about was "societal infrastructure", but built out a view based on the Web3 hypothesis, not all things in the universe
- Spent time unpacking "universal abundance" using dimensions of individuals-commons and protection-creation
- These should support the financial and social flywheels
	- Social flywheel: convening, harnessing knowledge, 
	- Financial flywheel: collecting and investing resources
- Community definition
	- people who have the skills and ideas connecting with the methods, tools and resources they need
- Different forms of leverage: we're looking or compounding leverage, but talking about two different things
	- external societal points of leverage
	- internal dynamics and business model leverage
		- labour, capital, networks: Web3 changes things for labour, for capital and the network
		- 

## Next Steps
- When are we ready to share with the broader community?
- Need to think about prioritization
- Share it as a Miro board?
	- Initial responses from core team
	- Then share out with the broader community
