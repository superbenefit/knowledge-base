# Community Experience Meeting

- Who: Peter, Mark, Heenal, Michelle
- When: Dec 30, 2021 
- structure for today and for a big onboarding
- words are magic - in birthing the words are most powerful and potent, not yet what we are and what is the universe of words to describe ourselves
- risk of not getting it right
- reputation management and always looking at how is the public record of our birth tell a compelling story
- need everyones help - superpower is noticing the right thing
- having a safe space for teams to work and do work - general circle where leads coming together and establishing a weekly cadence, a proposal for Monday evening for tactical evenings to coordinate - can bring things to be triaged, to keep work streams in sync
- establishing the projects have their own need for work, leads are being asked to structure this work and bring in contributors and does not mean everyone
- Foundation phase and genesis NFT - focus needs to be narrower and then grow, urgency around the moment we are in and getting the first pushes on flywheel - audience of those who are web3 native, who know what a DAO is, who know what an NFT is, burden of explanation is low, executable in short time, FOMO that exists in space that we want to not ignore, inherent understanding of a DAO like SB
- Member archetypes - we use the resources from the first raise to get us to the OHM fork, to scale the onboarding of the under represented groups and giving them clear ways to participate to help us build, to build tech, contract, developer, community
- Member needs - idea that there are people who don't want to see this go to the dark side, the web3 purists, the aspect of mattering
- Activities - onboarding on to projects, initial tests - e.g. web3 makers checking out Discord and getting onboarded
- Who do we want to join us and what do we want them to do - onboarding pathway and how do we get people contributing quickly
- There are people on board who would do more if they knew what the pathway to contribution is and know how their gifts can be of service
- Project has a defined outcome, for next few weeks this our focus, defining those work products, or finding more help
- Townhall - I know enough about the purpose and mission, learn more is to do, - we need to stress this during the townhall, does not feel safe to jump in, engagement and re-engagement, update, see who is here, see who is not here, send email for Townhall, 1 to 1 connections, guilds can provide a space for those who are curious and can contribute in another way, roles - anything we are missing - off topic channel - 
- Climate and environment seems to be missing from SB's ethos
	- idea: add to last value: "...for the earth and future generations"
- Token design and community engagement are closely linked
	- See Seed Club example of bounties: [https://seedclub.notion.site/f93e866598e849e594d1d5cbfc118cc4?v=3d3743ee2f714bd7b0271e7b4e12fb90](https://seedclub.notion.site/f93e866598e849e594d1d5cbfc118cc4?v=3d3743ee2f714bd7b0271e7b4e12fb90)
