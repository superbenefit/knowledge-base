#[[Nucleus]] #[[DAO Primitives]] 


## Purpose & Insight
This is outlined in the original proposal #[[SUP-257 Proposal SBP8- DAO Primitive Project
]]
## Decision making: governance & treasury
### Coordination protocols & tools
- **Relationship and Responsibilities to SuperBenefit **- This project is set up to work as an internal project for SB and will be working closely with the rest of the SB network. But the core team of this project has full autonomy over all activities and decisions. SuperBenefit governance only exerts decision-making power over this project via approving any future funding proposals.
- **Governance principles** - Starting out referring to the [SuperBenefit governance design principles ](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/work/SUP-55)
- **Governance structure **- starting with simple structure of:
	- **Point person - **is the main point of contact for the project @Rowan
	- **Core team** - who vote on governance decisions and have shared responsibility for the project @Ananth @Rowan  @rathermercurial 
	- **Contributors **- who participate 
- **Decision-making **- to start with decisions will be made in person in the weekly meeting doc and a-synch in the discord channel. Decision format - a consensus decision-making process

## Treasury
- **Wallet**
	- Multi-sigs set up in Safe on Mainnet and on Polygon network
	- 3 signers with 2 needed to to approve a transaction
	- Signers are:
		- @Rowan  - yeoro.eth
		- @Ananth - ananth.eth
		- @rathermercurial - 
- **Financial record keeping**
	- Currently keeping financial transactions on this doc and in the transaction records on Safe for both Cell wallets
- **Rewarding contributors **
	- We will run either a coordinape, (or less formal group process if the group is small) at appropriate inflection points to allocate tokens to reward core contributors (we will ask for additional budget from SB to fund this if needed)
	- Rewarding contributors agreement - [https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/d5fa17b4-5485-4636-9a7d-59e0b47a11b1](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/d5fa17b4-5485-4636-9a7d-59e0b47a11b1) 
- **Tokens **

	- Supply - 10,000,000
	- Token address: [0x016d5fe3cF44DD48702F46bDD39dB803E1806394](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x016d5fe3cF44DD48702F46bDD39dB803E1806394)

## Project management 
- **Weekly team meeting** - 45mins to sync up on progress and clear blocks
