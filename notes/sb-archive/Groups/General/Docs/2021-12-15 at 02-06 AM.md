hosting #[[Tactical Meetings]] 
# Hosting call - Michael, Michelle, Heenal
people need community, connection
KH did 1-2-1 onboarding calls
Q: what is forefront doing??

we don't want to get caught in the place of educating ppl who aren't willing to jump in

we could try peer support - a group of 6 or 1-2-1
holacracy "attracts a certain sort of person"
- for h & michelle to solve....
- least possible amount of governance


once we get more clarity with the projects and the project specs, we may revise roles and/or squads 

we are actually doing ok for engagement and ppl stepping up. compared to krause haus etc
