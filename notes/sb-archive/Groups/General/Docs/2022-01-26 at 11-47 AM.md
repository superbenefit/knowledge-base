- This is an ambitious project, similar to the "SuperBenefit Academy" idea that we've discussed, but orchestrated by a DAO that exists for the purpose of creating these kinds of resources and whose membership includes people with experience in the education/instruction field. I would love to support the Lexicon project; it definitely doesn't make sense to compete against it and I could see the web3 Library potentially becoming a distraction for SB if we don't manage it carefully.

- CCS say they are going to launch the DAO Lexicon first and "Next, weâ€™ll vote on a new topic (e.g. NFTs, Public Goods, DeFi, Gaming) and ship that Lexicon a couple of months later."

- The #[[Information Squad]] would love to be part of curating a "web3 & Equity" or "web3 for Social Impact" lexicon, if CCS would consider including that. We can hand off everything else and focus on impact, inclusion, diversity, equity, governance, abundance vs scarcity, reimagining society/civilization, revolutionary and radical things. Ideally this would not be the Info squad doing this work in isolation, but a collab between the info squad and a squad or project team from CCS.
