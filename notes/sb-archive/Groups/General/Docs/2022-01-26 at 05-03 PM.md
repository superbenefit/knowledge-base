#[[web3 library]] 
Feedback on web3library from call with Jai:
- ✅ SUP-145 guide page needs to be populated with articles widget 
- add learning pathways
- add a bit more blurb at the top of the library page
- "how to get started with the library"
- add glossary
- ✅ SUP-144 Q: should web3 be capitalized sometimes, always, never? 


No more library - Partner with CCS instead?
- library = form of onboarding to SB + a reference/signpost to what makes SB unique
- split functions:
	- get started + FAQ = onboarding
	- library = for more seasoned web3 travellers
	- 

Jai has a few hours a week, where is the best use of his time?
- "How can I help more people like me?"
- Glossary
	- DAO, NFT, DeFi, web3....
- Re-working the "Getting Started with web3" page
	- avoid jargon. even web3 primer is very complex
	- build in "why SB exists"
	- use "self, us and now" framework
	- **the end goal is not onboarding people to web3, it's how can we onboard people into our vision of what web3 could be**
	- ACTION
		- Jai will get started and will check back in on Monday
