The cell state document is intended to serve as an up-to-date reference for information related to the agreements, operations and relationships of the Windfall Energy Efficiency Project (WREEP) Cell.


# Purpose
- The purpose of this project has 2 aspects:
	1. To deliver a litepaper that outlines the design of the NFT based energy labelling platform that can open up energy usage data from individual householders and businesses, make it sharable and discoverable but at the same time respect the data sovereignty of the person who generates and owns the data
	2. To support the exploration and resourcing of the wider opportunity of the above platform developing into an interoperable energy data sharing protocol that can support an ecosystem of innovation in the sustainable energy space.
- Relationship to Stakeholders
	- This Cell is the Top Level Cell of the WREEP project. It is responsible for executing on the project.   
	- The core team will propose a this Cell State and a high-level plan for the project to the Stakeholder Group for approval. Approval of this proposal will act as the agreement between the stakeholder group and the core team for this fixed term project. 
	- The above high-level plan will be based on the funding agreement (signed by Windfall) plus any specific requirements expressed by the Stakeholder Group.   
	- The Cell has been created by SuperBenefit (via [this proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/superbenefit.eth/proposal/0x9dd77215645359e1d5b0abe9e2e1fe89ad7f184cd86d1af1bcc3724e7eaaf5e0)) and operates under the umbrella of SuperBenefit's norms and practices. 

# Practice
- ## Organization
	- ### Roles
		- Roles can be documented and visualized in [Sobol](https://sobol.io/d/sb_dao_primitive_cell/explorer/team/b4Khb1nbSL/roles?sideView=table&view=circles). ==NOTE - all references to Sobol are copied in from another Cell. These all need to be updated for the EEP Cell==
			- [**==Sobol - Reimagining Power Roles==**](https://sobol.io/d/sb_dao_primitive_cell/explorer/team/b4Khb1nbSL/roles?sideView=table&view=circles)
		- **Point Person(s)**
			- The point person acts as the primary point of contact for the project.
			- [**==Sobol - Point Person Role==**](https://sobol.io/d/sb_dao_primitive_cell/explorer/role/Qn1cuwJ28h/overview?view=circles)
		- **Core Team**
			- Operational stakeholders who share responsibility for this project's outcomes are referred to the "Core Team". 
			- Initial core team members are:
				- @Rowan    
				- @rathermercurial 
				- @Lewwwk 
				- @Ananth 
			- [**==Sobol - Core Team Role==**](https://sobol.io/d/sb_dao_primitive_cell/explorer/role/XngrXMCGje/overview?view=circles)
		- **Contributor**
			- Contributors who are not responsible for the project's outcomes, but who accomplish specific tasks related to its goals hold the "contributor" role.
			- **[==Sobol - Contributor Role==](https://sobol.io/d/sb_dao_primitive_cell/explorer/role/xbqSotLCNH/overview?view=circles)**
	- ### Role Badges
		- ==Describe and link to the cell's role badges here.==
	- ### **Contributor Rewards**
		- No decisions about how rewards will be earned and distributed have been made yet. But the core team and contributors will record their contributions to the project as [tasks here in Clarity](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/group/EEP/tasks) for future compensation.
- ## Coordination
	- ### Communication
		- The core team will meet weekly and will (for now) employ the [collaboration protocols](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/docs/cbf5146b-6d3f-4f75-9e51-0435f4011ed9) that have been adopted by the Reimagining Power Cell. These include:
			- Tactical meeting protocol
			- Decider protocol
			- Checkin protocol
	- ### Decision-Making
		- The cell uses [The Decider Protocol](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/docs/cbf5146b-6d3f-4f75-9e51-0435f4011ed9) for major decisions. 
		- Major decisions are logged in **[==Sobol - Reimagining Power Agreements==](https://sobol.io/d/sb_dao_primitive_cell/explorer/team/b4Khb1nbSL/agreements?sideView=table&view=circles)**
		- **Resource Allocation**
			- The core team will vote (off-chain) on resource allocation decisions. The team will implement a simple consent based voting system inspired by the _[Core Protocols - Decider Protocol ](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/decider)_
			- Decisions will be logged in the ==(yet to be created)== linked Decisions Log
			- The core team will propose its budget allocation plan to the stakeholder group for optimistic approval before allocating budgets to tasks. 
		- **Other Major Decisions**
			- Other major decisions will be made using the same decision protocol as resource allocation decisions 
	- ## Shared Tools
		- **Task Management**
			- Tasks and workstream projects can be tracked using [Clarity group task board](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/group/EEP/tasks). 
			- Tasks are managed in line with task management and compensation framework [https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/work/POW-292](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/work/POW-292) 
			- **Clarity - [Energy Efficiency Project Tasks](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/group/EEP/tasks)**
