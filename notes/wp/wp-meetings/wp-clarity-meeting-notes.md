### Decision log
### Action Items
### Planning

	- Superbenefit scope - to be attested to by us and windfall / the project stewardship group

	- BS's initial grounding doc - when it's starting to take shape we will move it gitbook and open up for comment and discussion in discord. 
	- Onboarding flow for discord is here [https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/project/298](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/project/298) 
	- Onboarding steps

			- Link to join discord
			- Link to Join stakeholder group
			- Link to join project community
			- Link to basic information about web3
			- Link to wallet setup instructions
			- Link to 1-1 help
		2. ~Create basic "what is web3", including what is a wallet stuff - Jess has some library of resources to share for onboarding ~
		3. ==Figure out special considerations for indigenous communities comms and participation in the process ==
		4. Set up an Onboarding event - PSHG onboarding
			- 4pm Dec 5 for session #1 - for pilot stakeholder group
				- Set up calendar event 
			- Pencil Jan 9 and 11 for two followups - one for North America and one for Europe/Asia - these will double up as onboarding for community members
			- Put together post for launch
		5. Set up/finish onboarding docs in Gitbook
			- Project overview 
			- ~code of conduct + chathamhouse rules~
			- Design the language for setting the tone/context for the group. 
	- Community management
		- Set up management for SHG conversations
			- Calendar of topics
			- Management of discord groups, setting up conversation threads, encouraging conversation - assign going this as a role
			- Set up ability for anon posting
	- Wider comms/PR
		- Jess can offer help on public facing PR comms - perhaps do a 30 min session to work some of this out (from Jess)
	- **Formal temp checks at draft and final**
		- Snapshot for temp checks
			- Check with BS if they want to break the drafts into pieces to temp check it. (discuss this with BS at this week's meeting)
			- Perhaps use multiple ongoing snapshots that cover different pieces and then people change their votes over time
			- Try to reward people with tokens for regularly updating their votes on snapshot
		- Perhaps use Lore for the community group management
- **Setting up the project Community**
	- **community launch timing and requirements**
		1. initial announce post
			- what's going on and why
			- what's the opportunity
			- how can you participate
		2. set of conversation / discussions/ actions (stuff for people to do)
			- areas of activity
			- questions / topics from blockscience - put together an initial topic calendar to seed the forum with  - we can publish this to the Project SHG 
		3. might be good to send the signup link alongside all other outreach (feel free share and invite colleagues/broadcast etc.)
	- **community incentive design**
		- A token that reflects contributions and can be used in decision-making mechanisms - see [https://docs.google.com/document/d/10wCVwJ685MwzfyAoUaMzjrVIqUCO-3NrZHFMru8ayY0/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10wCVwJ685MwzfyAoUaMzjrVIqUCO-3NrZHFMru8ayY0/edit) 
	- **community grant fund design**
		- Possibly have a fund that is governed by the community token holders. With rage quit for capital contributors 
		- Mix of potential funders - insurance cos, govt grant funding programmes, philanthropics, 
		- Ideally, we have an open ended vehicle. Need to solve the fiat conversion. 
		- Get a small lead sponsor - 
		- Some of the activity could be operationalised through a cell as well as being pushed out as funding to wider community opportunities 
	- **Investment/capital fund - for implementation **

# 9/18/23
- ## Check-In
	- **Facilitator: Rowan**
		- 
	- ### Attendees:
		-  Ananth, rathermercurial, Lewwwk, Rowan
		- **Regrets:  **
- ## Updates
	- Look to get a request for funds by the end of the month
	- Suggestion that we run the main project management against the key milestones 
	- Resourcing side - looking to pool resources as matching contributions to initial govt contribution
	- Possibility for a research group coming out of a university masters programme 
- ## Agenda
	- 
- ## Longer items:
	- Discuss stakeholder engagement - Windfall, SB, Possibilian (Rowan)
		- Next layer: additional funders
		- Adjacent layer (approval/adoption of drafts/final): local stakeholders interviewed for input
	- Review figjam and figure out high level strategy components (Rowan) [https://www.figma.com/file/QrzB4UI06FPHkOng075fuw/Energy-Efficiency-Project-Design?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=8Twinza8ijQr9XBU-1](https://www.figma.com/file/QrzB4UI06FPHkOng075fuw/Energy-Efficiency-Project-Design?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=8Twinza8ijQr9XBU-1)  
	- Stakeholder set up 
		- Stakeholder group - Windfall (Brent), Possibilian (Michael), SuperBenefit (?)
		- Try to use Open Collective - if WF wants to get set up as a fiscal sponsor on it and handle the funs transfer directly. 
		- If we do the above, then all the stakeholder group needs is a discussion place (e.g discord) and a voting mechanism (e.g snapshot) 
			- We can be very light weight on the decision making for the SHG because the scope is very tight 
		- We can develop a token to use to recognise contributions, bounties etc. Perhaps use the new Hats EAS attestation tool. Need to be able to quantify the value. Perhaps track with points with source cread. As long as we don't lean too heavily on this as a way of getting paid. 
- ## Action items
	- [ ] Michael to take a look at open collective, and discuss with Brent about appropriate financial rails
	- [ ] Set up a stakeholder group channel in the SB discord
	- [ ] Set up git hub and gitbook as the place to follow the stages and feedback towards the lite paper (@rathermercurial can do this if needed)
	- [x] Set up source cred (demo) to track contributions @rathermercurial 
	- [ ] Rowan and Michael to jam on strategy outline/workflow

- ## Discussion Topics:
	- **Notes from first call 4/9/23**
	- Overall objective to create a light paper on an NFT based energy sharing platform
		- Design - not a technical specification yet
		- 2 phases - 1 energy labeling design, what needs to be included 2. The interoperability component - how people can engage with the protocol
		- Windfall has the stakeholder group and can bring these together -
		- We need to coordinate the stakeholders and get feedback
			- Engage with the SH
			- Draft an approach - get feedback
			- Draft a final approach
		- Need to scope this as simply as possible
		- Talking with block science about contributing to the lite paper
		- This can explode in the different applications and uses of this. Can we design a coordination mechanism that does 2 things
			- 1 Design and delivery of the lightpaper
			- 2 Parallel process that engages with the stakeholder to explore what else can be done around the protocol - this is separate from the lightpaper
		- Core project focus is on energy efficiency in the Durham region. Designing for this will be the main focus of the light paper. The broader protocol (token and economic design) will be the parallel work stream
		- The first chunk of funds is for coordination
		-  design - this can include how we set up a shared resource pool that we can pull together to deliver on both work stream designs - This could include using SB's governance design on
			- 1. Participation in researching and delivering the lightpaper
			- 2. Pulling together stakeholders to explore the broader opportunity
		- We can carve out 20k ish for SB to cover the coordination set up
		- Perhaps Block Science could deliver the entire lite paper
		- Overall budget 140k - 40k to windfall for stakeholder and reporting to govt. Perhaps 60-70k CAD. This would leave 20-30k for SB + other funders that we would bring in
		- BwB or other could come in as a stakeholder
		- The stakeholder module design around this could be a looser design where stakeholders are brought into a "conversation" as funding contributors
		- Perhaps there is a mini implementation fund that can invest around the opportunity - creating an ecosystem of public goods funding around the protocol. E.g green municipal fund could contribute with the value prop being that there is genuine community governance around this fund. And commercial operators can use the protocol. Overtime we can build in a protocol fee to fund this in the future. Perhaps there is a dealflow aspect where funders get access to the projects developing on the protocol
