# Meeting Agenda

Weekly meeting agenda & notes for the WREEP web3 core team.

## Checkin

### Intentions & Tensions

## Updates

- Litepaper essentially done; Waiting on final word from Bsci

- [Project page](https://wp.docs.superbenefit.org/project) updated; Litepaper page WIP

## Discussion Items

-  

- **_Longer Items:_**

## **Report Drafting**

  - Note - go for 2-3 pages total. Be very direct about focusing on the learnings 

  - Note - as we are writing make a judgement call on whether to directly address the numbers that we promised and either address them directly. 

  - Note - we could share this if we wanted to. What might that look like? Perhaps showcase what we put in place. Publish on SB and other places. 

  - Note - 

 Number of token-enabled participants visiting the design portal
 Number of community groups represented in active stakeholder group
 Number of distinct commenters who provided feedback on “lite” paper

  - **NRCan Report outline**


1. **Intro**

   - Overview of the doc and main points

   - Include the future evolution - we are just starting with the community

2. **Objectives and design**

   - Reference agreement and outline what we planned to do

   - The 2 communities we needed to engage

3. **What we built (outputs)**

   - Web 2 and Web3 infrastructure for each community

4. - This is what is interesting about what we built

5. **Outcomes**

   - Engagement from SHG in conversations

   - Engagement from the community

   - Learnings


1. **Stakeholders**


1. Overview 


1. Pivot - Initially it was assumed that we the LP approach would be driven by direct learning from stakeholders. But as the research unfolded we came to understand that:

2. Stakeholder engagement to research driven
   


1. Most of the relevant research and data was already available

2. At this early stage asking people about user experience was premature. This would come in the next stage when the detailed design of the protocol would happen. This would include user insights and testing for the interfaces that the different user types would need to interact with.

3. As a result we scaled down the emphasis on on stakeholder engagement to a smaller number of people from key parts of the ecosystem who served the role of surfacing things that may have been missing from the existing research as well as giving the researchers an opportunity to flesh out their understanding of the dynamics that surfaced in the research

4. The type and stage of this as a complex engineering task. Litepaper stage is more about the possibility, Later stage would be more customer driven.


1. Attendance of calls - small numbers but good participation in the calls. The numbers were pretty decent across the community. There were quite a few people who showed up to more than one call.


1. Add attendance numbers


1. Engagement with Web3 tooling post call - nil


1. Possible lack of interest - or lack of ability to see an opportunity

2. Possible lack of capacity - time/focus

3. Possible hesitancy in engaging

4. Possible confusion / difficulty in accessing the tools

5. Possible deficiencies in the messaging about engagement pathways

6. Possible lack of understanding about the opportunities to engage e.g the $ENERGY token opportunity - - Stakeholders being professionals working in the connected industries and government agencies didn't really recognise the opportunity of the $ENERGY token and the potential for future ownership/governance participation in the development and use of the protocol

7. Leave space for people to engage with the tools after the litepaper is released

8. Small sample size: Engagement rates in web3 communities can be as low as 1% (typically \~10%) depending on the desired action & incentive. Our sample size was 8, meaning 0 participants should be expected under normal circumstances.


1. Structure


1. Here's our approach

2. Here's what we could have done different

3. Here's what we are doing next


1. Include the stakeholders in a wider effort as the project evolves. As a whitepaper is created and there is more space for stakeholders to engage with the specifics of how the protocol will work. This will include broader stakeholders such as actual home occupants and things like interface/UX design and other specifics

2. Future strategy 1. For next steps to get the SHs more engaged in the future, we are focusing on developing the broader community because this will create more of an opportunity for stakeholders to see future potential for them to be more involved, (e.g governance, energy tokens etc)

3. Future strategy 2. Now that we have the litepaper we will share it with a broader group of stakeholders who will be able to engage based on reading the final litepaper. This follows the pivot to research, once we have the litepaper we will actually need to engage more broadly to get insights and user testing from all of the different stakeholders on the list. 

4. Future strategy 3. Use a different way of engaging (if we tried this again), than using web3 tooling.  Think this through


1. **Community**


1. (note) Focus on outlining the new things we are doing and where the community is going 

2. Once we get the litepaper released there can be more engagement

3. Then after a Whitepaper release this community engagement can increase. Creating more diversity and high context engagement into more specific aspects of the design and implementation 

4. We are trying to steward the community as we go forward. 

5. Explaining the rationale for our initial approach and what we learned from it


1. E.g what we did with the information we created

2. What are the participatory feedback loops that we created


1. What are the feedback loops that we are creating for the next stage

2. Laying out the next steps - 

3. **Conclusions** / next steps 

4. 

5. 

6. Super early stage is hard to engage people in because there isn't enough definition. Post litepaper this will be easier. Generally a small, high-context team is needed to get the shape of the initial idea moving, then when there is enough surface on the idea people in the community can come in and build on different aspects of it.

   - Close in folks will help because they have extra context e.g people already close in to the superbenefit network where we can just talk them through the project
