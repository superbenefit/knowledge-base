# **SuperBenefit Project Plan for WREEP**

This plan outlines the activities that SuperBenefitDAO's WREEP Cell will engage in to deliver the coordination elements of the Windfall Residential Energy Efficiency project. The WREEP Cell is an operational team inside the SuperBenefitDAO network.
This plan reflects the agreement between Windfall Ecology Centre and Natural Resources Canada. It aims to deliver on the scope of this agreement, with the exclusion of researching and writing the actual Litepaper, which is contracted between Windfall Ecology Centre and BlockScience. 
This project plan is broken into 2 main areas of activity that the Cell with engage in:
1. Supporting coordination activity and infrastructure associated with and culminating in the delivery of the Protocol Litepaper (being developed by BlockScience)
2. Leading community engagement and coordination, including development of the associated coordination infrastructure, for broader exploration and advancement of the protocol's implications and uses.

## **1. Supporting development and delivery of the Protocol Litepaper**
### **Steps:**
- Designing the overall governance and coordination mechanism for the project
- Supporting in the set up of the _Project Stewardship_ _group_ (Windfall, Natural Resources Canada, Possibilian, SuperBenefit and BlockScience)
	- Onboarding the Project Stewardship Group, helping them get set up, suggesting communication and decision-making processes for the group
- Initial agreement (via proposal) and ongoing communication with Project Stewardship Group
- Developing coordination tooling and processes for stakeholder engagement and feedback for development of the Litepaper
	- Tooling to convene and communicate with stakeholders - _Pilot Stakeholder Group_ (Windfall, NRC, Durham Region and related entities, communities, and groups) to:
		1. Engage in feedback on components of the Litepaper as they are developed
			- Set up publishing and commenting forum as required 
		2. Signal support or dissent at Litepaper milestones on the proposed design direction
			- Design a token voting mechanism for members of the Pilot Stakeholder Group to signal their views
- Support stakeholder coordination on implementation funding as mutually agreed

## **2. Community engagement and coordination around protocol development and applications.**
### **Steps:**
Coordinating the development of a _Project Community_ of individuals and organisations who have an interest in applying and advancing the protocol when it is complete.
- Design, implement, and operate community coordination and incentive infrastructure
- Coordinate community conversation - create an ongoing communication channel and broadcast channel to facilitate community onboarding and discussion 
- Support design and development of a community fund to pay for ongoing research and development of the protocol
- Support community members in bringing proposals to the community, and where passed, support the instantiation of those efforts as appropriate within community coordination structure.

**Transitioning the project upon completion**
Transitioning the project from its initial focus on delivery of the Litepaper, governed by a small group of stakeholders - into a community governed project that can grow beyond its original scope to encompass the design of a broader global network economic model.  

## Activities / Timeframes 
### **October 01, 2023 - March 31, 2024**
1. Designing the overall stakeholder governance mechanism for the project 
2. Complete initial project plan and cell state for proposal to the Project Stakeholder Group
3. Set up of Project Stakeholder Group 
	1. Set up communication channel, decision-making and meeting cadence. Monthly zoom call, google doc for meeting notes, discord channel
	2. Propose initial agreement and cell state to Project Stakeholder Group
4. Pilot stakeholder group
	1. Create stakeholder list
	2. Initial contact/email invitation
	3. Discord set up and onboarding
	4. Hats/badging for Pilot Stakeholder Group members 
	5. Design and implement feedback mechanism: 
		1. Design flow of feedback process
		2. Github, Gitbook setup + access control/token-gating
		3. Tracking feedback activities (SourceCred) 
		4. Set up snapshot for signalling vote
		5. Set up instructions / walk-through of feedback process for members
5. Set up Project Community
	1. Create list of potentials
	2. Design communication strategy
		1. Outreach
		2. Onboarding
		3. Ongoing conversations, communication
		4. Convene specific conversations to explore the evolution of the project:
			1. Broader network economic design around the protocol
			2. Community fund
			3. Innovation fund
6. Design transition of the project beyond the initial Litepaper delivery into a larger community governed vehicle.
