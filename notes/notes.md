Welcome to the Project Workspaces! This section offers a glimpse into the active development of our knowledge around decentralized organizations (DAOs), Web3 governance, and social impact initiatives.

Think of this as our collaborative workshop, where ideas are shaped, connected, and refined.

Here, you'll find:

*   **Evolving Ideas:** Notes that are actively being developed and refined, reflecting our current thinking on various topics.
*   **Project-Specific Materials:** Content related to specific projects and initiatives within the SuperBenefit community.
*   **Interconnected Knowledge:** Links between notes, as well as to external resources in our Web3 Library and definitions in our Lexicon.
