Understand why choosing to be part of this space, examples
 a place to practice and learn what a DAO is
-a place to learn about web3
-a playground and place of experimentation and putting projects into multiple
-what does this place represent for me-a space that is collaborative and co-created-setting people up to contribute something, in those weeks they are part of something, their efforts and energy
-it is impossible to onboard yourself into web3 without doing
-so those who are motivated because they are connected to a project, or woud like to contribute
-if for a broader audience, we need to create that motivation
-contribute something, need to contributed something that they are well veersed in, connected to or have skills
-understand the capacity people have, here is what I hope to gain, that will help us to clarify on our offerings related to restorying power e.g a workshop on restoryong power, meeting a partner, 
-perhaps folks can self assign for contributions e.g. some are mentors, designers, questioners, facilitators, evaluators
-what are the concrete milestones to get a better understanding - what are tangible things e.g 3 months and 6 months 
-road map of leveling up as a beginning in SB, pathways to learn, 3-6 months, what are jump off points

@Aditi @heenal @duara @MBaldwin 
- Adding in notes for year in review for SB for 2023
- Used ChatGPT to get high level outline - for sections/sub-headings - how do we want to present this, timeline on mirror?
- represent the emergence and key themes
- could have timeline for this story, or the proposals or traditional milestones, visual or more artistic piece
- Next Steps for RPP journey: 
	- Heenal to review doc for accuracy
	- Writing for framing
	- Timeline Visual - spend some time going through Discord or Clarity to pull out key milestones
		- Is the information in the chat the timeline we are hoping to implement into a visualization? YES and this is the full version [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hsK7G6I3aRL4yUwPTlQtdckUCH5hHRTgrlQJetW85GU/edit#heading=h.ukt1sxt0k46](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hsK7G6I3aRL4yUwPTlQtdckUCH5hHRTgrlQJetW85GU/edit#heading=h.ukt1sxt0k46) 
	- Add at conclusion about what is next - a statement of next steps for project and then what and how do we invite them to stay curious and engaged - call to action about relationship to power, and how this project relates to the RPP
	- Aditi away Oct 23rd or 30th

Next Steps
- Aditi do a timeline template and for others connect in add to
- All to support timeline
- Njoki call to action specific to relationship to power and Heenal about the broader call to action for RPP
- Think through the written piece
- Michelle to pull together the reimagining power in philanthropy context

Purpose (draft ideas)
- To tell the story of the Reimagining Power cell
	- The story so far
		- Blog - story of SB, STP, DAO primitives, how the stakeholders came together
		- Visual - timeline, linking out to artifacts, meeting minutes
	- The ongoing story
		- An experiment in radical transparency
	- 
- Provide prompts and opportunities for reflection
- The place of practice

Activities/outputs
- story of how we got to where we are today
- radically transparency with the RP project/process

Discussion
- RP project is quite practical - playbook etc. Would be nice to have a more aspirational aspect to the project.
- This Cell could make SB more accessible
- Immediate need for transparency - harvesting RP cell meetings and distributing notes appropriately


## Questions for discussion
- Comments from njoki:
	- In terms of ideas for exploration, I really like the suggestion to be radically transparent with the RP project/process. 
	- I see us being able to demonstrate conversations about power. 
	- I would be able to lend my writing to the more theoretical/abstract explorations of power. 
	- I think that you both have a more nuanced understanding and engagement with the genesis and journey of the RP project to date. 
	- I see the first piece being around laying this groundwork and sharing some initial prompts/questions for consideration. 
	- Then perhaps some more abstract writing later. 
- Would this be a cell of SuperBenefit or of Reimagining Power?
- What is our a) initial and b) future possible scope of work?
- How does this project relate to SuperBenefit's goal of #[[G-291 Telling SuperBenefit's Story]]?
	- Does it relate to other projects or goals, like #[[Mapping Pathways to The Future]]?
- How does this project relate to the #[[Reimagining Power]]?
- Does this squad (Michelle, Njoki, Heenal) desire/require autonomy to take on responsibilities and create within the whole of SuperBenefit DAO? Or are they wanting to collaborate strictly within the scope of the #[[Reimagining Power]] project?
- Consistent Nomenclature: Restorying vs ReStorying vs Re-Storying
- Purpose or Focus: 
	- Harvest learning from the RPP and share out - and need consensus from stakeholders on sharing it out 
	- Reflection and prompts for individuals reflection shifting power and transforming systems
	- A place of practice for key stakeholders and others in reshaping the narratives around power and systems transformation 
	- Could be podcast, collage or zine, poetic harvesting

	- Reimagine power's overarching purpose:
		- To explore how web3 can shift power, transform systems and shape better futures. In particular, how the concept of DAOs as purpose-driven networks of small autonomous teams can redistribute power, value flows and resources across society at scale.
