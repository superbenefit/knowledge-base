# Notes:
- ## Meeting 9/21/23:
- Where we landed as a plan is for #[[Stakeholder Engagement - Reimagining Power]]:


	1. Michelle to reach out to all the potential stakeholders (OTF, EF, RI, AIFS and SB). And invite them to become part of the Stakeholder Group for the project. Share with them a brief outline of what being in the Stakeholder Group would look like (plus share the outline that **@rathermercurial** is working on and the updated stakeholder model doc once **@Rowan** and **@heenal** have reworked it).

	2. When all or some of the potential stakeholders have indicated that they want to be part of the SHG we invite them to a session (that we will facilitate) to get the group set up:
	3. Figure out how they want to work together  - meeting and making decisions
	4. Outline a simple tooling setup for them to use - e.g discord, clarity docs etc
	5. Help them understand the role of stakeholders in the group and answer any questions they have
- 

	1. Facilitate them and us (perhaps using an outside facilitator) to define the purpose/direction for the RPP project and define any other requirements that the relationship between stakeholder group and this team will need to fulfil.
	2. Question about how many from each stakeholder for the stakeholder group
	3. We will aim to nudge the stakeholder group in it's set up to have 1 or 2 people representing in the initial design conversations - they can later bring others in as needed
