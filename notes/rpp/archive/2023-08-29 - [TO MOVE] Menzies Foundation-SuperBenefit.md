#[[Reimagining Power]] 

Feb 6, 2024
Liz, Rowan, Michelle
-intersted but not prepared to commit to get into the nitty gritty
-Ian Bird, Australian - vision of referencing in Canada - much to be learned from this community, CFs miles behind 
- need a partner and he has a task ahead of him and needs times
- too early 

-Impact Investment Summit in March - hosting a webinar and socializing report
-Victorian Leadership - rural regional leadership collective, not sure how going to coalesce
-Regen Melbourne working with DML - meeting coming up
Robust Democracies - often come up from particular perspecgive and confuse advocacy and activsism - regenerative economies but not crossing over folks
- 3 pillars - narrative & culture that defines community ina. global polcarized world, what I culture and infrastrucuture
- -capability - what is capability platform
- -governance and capital - needs to be reimagined 
- Sandpit - 9 regional citizens leadership reslience play and prospect of a DAO
	- ecoomic development and entrenerpresurship - cintinuum of capital with concessionary, to philanthropy to crowdsourcing to DAOS
	- Robust Democracy -citiznd engagement and civic engagment - 
		- Radical XChange - larger scale 
		- how do small groups come together and make robust agreements
			- tangible ways to build robust democracies 
			- how to solve problem - how do you disrupt entrenched power 
			- web3 as platform for a community like building more democracy of tomorrow 
				- diversity of candidates
				- civic engagement
				- and creates a blueprint 

different folks who would want to coalesce - 

Next Steps:
Prefers to do it tangibly as a DAO
Let's do Skoll 
And then will make a decision

- one of challenges is citizne leadership and resilience
-new capital flows and governance
-often dependent in government, and how communities can build out new capabilities
-developed platform - different partnerships and abilities, consoldiating those relationships and setting up the parameters of the group, social capital and community resilience as one project, anotehr one around enterprise and social enterprise around resilience, capability piece with rising teams, culture piece is now in phase 2 - 9 communities confirmed
-started conversations with funders and seed or we can do more money and do faster - other funders get it and see it - Paul Ramsay Foundation and written to them, you are funding and we are fundign and have you thought of coherence and meetings across 4 parts of orgs - web3 response and paper - paper my head explode and cannot get my head around it
-new ways of thinking of capital and governance and 
-CF Australia - Ian Bird - field builder, sustainable CF model
-can't be Menzies DAO 
$500K and a partnership model is in place - partners to build this out and keen to engage and incubation stage - Collaboration for Impact is a partner
9 communities - agreed to culture and capabilities 
socializing with philanthropy - Philanthropy Australia - conference and one topic to be web3 - has not cultivate audience at all and the investment landscape
create the grounds so not just Menzies Foundation, governance and capital is one of the big challenges to address 
if my agenda 
Paul Ramsay - looking at system intermediaries - Collaboration for Impact (similar to Tamarack) and second convo - 4 convos - Menzies Foundation is in that mix - interested in capability piece but not prepared to put web3 - 10M pot for CFs to reimagine model
Ian Bird is key - 
Need to crack audience

Collaboration for Impact & Menzies - to launch paper, - edit paper to a short sound bite - webinar
Regen Melbourne - is all set in culture piece and could set up a DAO, regnerative economics, DML 
-create new community conversation and narrative, where is the community sense of ownership and how grounded in what community needs, first to set up DAO

-DAOs can be done in a participatory way and time limited around
Sport - pooling of funds is show doing it, not suggesting right for philanthropy
Climate Justice/Climate Transition - shortcut could be another option of early movers with 9 communities 
 Agreement for 9 communities 

Ian Bird for authority level 
- PRF conversation 
Next Steps
Webinar launch of paper - or series - Rowan, Michael, Michelle - on agenda and podcast
-what collateral can we take from this
-and SB to get out into the ecosystem 
-sound bites about how gamechanger for CFs and why should be at a cutting edge, why a tool as capability oppo capital and governance, in practical terms of sports and climate
 Fieldbuilding Bridgespan Consortium - new ways of thinking about capital and governance - 1 day workshop on fieldbuilding - agenda 

Idea from Michael
The one other thought that comes up is using a ‘proto-dao’ as the education vehicle to help the community explore the field/concepts. (Simple practical outputs informed by their questions, challenges, and interests)
Which itself could be structured as a 6 month learning journey.

Most salient for Liz:
3 communities around climate transition - proto-DAO
Ambitious play
-authority to set agenda - Ian and Collaboration for Impact, Seed Data and other system intermediaries - system capability catalyzers and use Menzies as a sandbox and create a lab and we would have a different way of accelerating 
March - Impact Conference
August - Philanthropic Australia Conference
Lord Mayor's Foundation - supports Regen Melbourne [https://www.lmcf.org.au/](https://www.lmcf.org.au/) 

Next Steps:
Michelle to send outline for a contract and follow up about Menzies Foundation and web3 wallet or how to flow the 25K. Keep it high level and work through the what as we go.

Thanks for your email – and apologies for not getting back to your sooner.
I am happy to report that my Board approved our 2024 budget in which I have an allocation to support our collaboration.
 
However, I am conscious that I cannot move more quickly than my other collaboration partners and still have some way to go to bed down these initiatives and seed the thinking and inclination of these partners to explore Web3 financing options.  This will be on the agenda for next year – and I’ll be in touch in the new year to start to put things in place.
 
In the meantime, I’ve reached out to Ian Bird – and am waiting for him to get in touch.  I am keen to brief him – and seek his feedback and interest in engaging with this work.
 
Have a wonderful holiday season – I share your frustration that progress is slower than I hoped but I keep reminding myself that I can ‘only move at the speed of trust’.
 
Best wishes

Draft Email to Liz November 20, 2023


Hello Liz
Thanks for the great call recently! 
In follow up to your enthusiasm about engaging in web3 and SuperBenefit we have been reflecting on our last meeting. You had shared your hope for engaging, learning and onboarding into web3 and bringing others who are interested into this journey.

We are proposing the following 6 month project:
-developing a public good about onboarding into web3
-opportunities for learning by doing by engaging with live projects

-2-3 web3 adventure tours with those Menzies Foundation identify as interested and hosted by SuperBenefit and Menzies Foundation
-the onboarding and collaboration tooling will be included in the DAO Playbook and Menzies will be recognized for supporting this part of the project


This $25K commitment will enable us to assemble the team for user design and development of this onboarding public good. We are excited for this opportunity to engage stakeholders in your region into web3 in partnership with you and your learning journey at Menzies Foundation.

Another option is for SuperBenefit DAO to support the Symbiotic Leadership project to establish community participation and the experience layer. Using web3 tooling and participatory practices we would work with you to establish and host a participatory space that meaningfully gathers stakeholders and community into your work. The space will be optimized to encourage community-led contributions to the mission, both directed and self-determined. Within the first six-months we aim for the community to be self-reliant, capable of taking on hosting and operations should there be ongoing interest and momentum.

We look forward to next steps!
ML Framing: i'm unsure there is something specific underway/planned in rp or by others on 'pubilc good about web3 onboardng', but here is what I was trying to articulate in the call with liz and today
Establish community participation and experience layer with and for your (Liz's) '??? Leadership' project. Using web3 tooling and participatory practices we will work with you to establish and host a participatory space that meaningfully gathers stakeholders and community into your work. The space will be optimized to encourage community-led contributions to the mission, both directed and self-determined. Within the first six-months we aim for the community to be self-reliant, capable of taking on hosting and operations should there be ongoing interest and momentum.
Proposal sent to Liz [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s0o6b46FQsQFEtXHAH_uBg8aJXqexIdPUOzY1l_cNXc/edit#heading=h.r0oytpmule8j](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s0o6b46FQsQFEtXHAH_uBg8aJXqexIdPUOzY1l_cNXc/edit#heading=h.r0oytpmule8j) 

**Latest Response from SuperBenefit**

Hello Liz and Trudy
Big thanks for the final version of the paper and I am excited to integrate this into the fourth year course I am co-teaching in.

For the follow up on the proposal, I wanted to clarify that the proposal was from SuperBenefit DAO that is made up of a global set of members and myself and Community Foundations of Canada are one of the stakeholder/partners.

The support we were offering was to support the coordination and development of some of the web3 related projects to demonstrate the principles in the paper, document the learning and connect them to a global ecosystem.

SuperBenefit uses community governance and participatory approaches that have the local projects guiding their work and we would be layering in coordination mechanisms and tooling to support these purpose driven autonomous teams to flourish and maximize "symbiotic leadership".

You can see our team as hands-on capacity and infrastructure to weave web3 enabled coordination, governance, and self-determination into these local and allied projects.

Jumping on a phone call sounds like a great next step. The dates you sent are tricky so I wondered about 7pm ET on Monday Oct 30th?

We are excited to dive into a deeper conversation!

Attached is the final version of the paper – we are still working through how best to launch it- but in the meantime please use it as you see fit.  We are a little ahead of the game in Australia and so still thinking how best to curate an audience interested in connecting with us in the longer term.
 
I also have been working though the approach we are going to take to exploring the potential of Web3 to unlock community resilience.   I’ve attached a slide which starts to bring the Menzies Foundation thinking together.  This has emerged from the series of conversations I’m in the midst of with partners/potential partners.
 
In summary:
 
- Over the last decade or so there has been growing global interest in place-based initiatives to build community resilience.  These have tended to emanate from three sources:
	- the collective impact movement, supported by philanthropy and government.   Often focused on more joined up service system approaches to address disadvantage, and funded by government, social impact bonds etc
	- Local government initiatives, often led by Mayors, and funded by government and philanthropy (eg. Bloomberg Philanthropies)
	- Community Foundations – funded by community orientated philanthropy

 
- There have been some significant outcomes from this work – although change tends to be incremental and the agenda for change often determined by government, which diminishes opportunities for innovation and community agency

 
- In reframing an approach to build community resilience there are two questions:
	- How do we build a ‘culture’ which supports citizens to act for the ‘greater good’ and contribute to community resilience, and what is the infrastructure which scaffolds this action
	- What is the engine required to drive this change process, in terms of the mechanism for citizens to convene and the capability platform that supports this engagement

 
- Our challenge is to develop a field-building platform which supports the development of the constituent parts which in combination build community resilience.  The Menzies Foundation is working with a series of collaboration partners to answer these questions, and establishing incubators and sandpits to test, trial, codify and scales these platforms on the following basis (see attached slide)

o   Culture and infrastructure: Participatory Melbourne: Menzies Foundation, Regen Melbourne, Swinburne University, Coalition of Everyone
o   Community Resilience Engine: Symbiotic Leadership: ANU School of Cybernetics (see below)
o   Three areas of application/Sandpits:
§  Citizen Leadership and Community Resilience:
·       Citizen Leadership and Community Resilience: 9 rural and regional Victorian communities  (place-based focus)
·       Climate Transition: Collaboration for Impact (multi-place-based focus on climate transition)
§  Economic Development and Entrepreneurship
·       Accelerating Entrepreneurs: Australian Centre for Rural Entrepreneurship/ACUMEN
§  Governance & Capital
·       Web 3 Finance: Lend for Good/Collaboration for Impact/Community Foundations of Canada
 
- An essential element of this platform is a scalable digital leadership development platform which builds leadership and collaborative capacity in real time, centred in the work at hand.  Arising from our work over the last five years we are in the process of developing a new approach to leadership, (we are calling it SYMBIOTIC LEADERSHIP)  which shifts the focus from the development of individual leaders to an orientation on building collaborative capacity and the efficacy of teams and the leaders of those teams to unlock the networked effect of the power of the collective. We have just finalized an agreement to appoint Dr Aiden Thornton as the Menzies Senior Research Fellow in Leadership and Complexity at the ANU Centre of Cybernetics to continue to test and iterate this model in the context of the Community Resilience platform,  and taken an equity position with Rising Team, a silicon valley start-up, such that our investment will fund the development of a symbiotic leadership digitized platform. I’ve attached our embargoed Symbiotic Leadership Pack)

 
I appreciate that this is a lot (!) – and suggest that we schedule a call to discuss in more detail.   The point of setting all of this out is to explain how the Foundation is thinking of embedding a Web3 innovation into a catalytic platform, such that the collaboration partners and communities themselves develop an impetus and drive to build community resilience. My hope is that this platform leverages the networks and resources of each partner, because, in combination, we are answering each of their specific questions in the context of the system challenge. (Less customer acquisition costs!)
 
And so, I have a couple of hundred thousand to build this model.  Most usually, I build these platforms and others crowd in when it starts to become apparent that we are on to something, 
 
Consequently, I am very interested in continuing to explore how we can partner with Community Foundations of Canada – although $100,000 will be too steep at this stage.  And so, there are several ways that we might develop this partnership:
- We join your global community of practice and share our learnings
- Community Foundations of Canada replicates the intent of our platform in Canada, and we combine our networks and resources to contribute to a joined-up citizen leadership and community resilience initiative.  (it would be great to learn from each other) 

 
I’ve coped Trudy Morrison into this email, and she will support us to get a date in the diary.
 
Very much looking forward to our next conversation!
 
Best wishes


Notes from Liz Oct 



Meeting Notes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O2cKF5dA62hcCMSe4jt-uIlUAwUtyC4bu75eS1E5GMA/edit)

Concept Ideas
- Reimagining Power - contribute as cell for DAO work with Indigneous communities or Regen Melbourne 
	- contribute in the stakeholder group
	- contribute financially to Philanthropy Playbook #2 that outlines experiments (AIFS, Equality Fund, Reimagine Institute, Menzies Foundation) with case studies, learning and application to philanthropy and philanthropic models/systems
	- Make the playbook the follow-up to their paper. They can join in to the reimagining power project to help guide/contribute to it. If appropriate, can then propose/launch the global philanthropy and web3 network as a follow-on project.
	- If any connection to sport direct or in their network, could replicate an aifs cell there (e.g. court refurb/place based). 
	- Building on Michaels comments... there is the possibility for Menzies Foundation to get involved with RP project in a couple of ways:
		- As a stakeholder - there is an opportunity for Menzies Foundation to join the stakeholder group. This would be in partnership with the existing stakeholders, so OTF, EF, SB, RI & AIFS would have to approve this (the process around forming the stakeholder group is yet to be formalised, so there is some thinking to do before we can do this). 

If Menzies Foundation was able to come into the stakeholder group as funder it would increase the scope of activities that the project could engage in. MF would get a voice in the stakeholder group to nudge this work in directions that they are interested in. If they contributed funding as well, we could potentially spin up some experiments around some of the MF projects in Australia. 
		- As operational contributors - this would give either Liz and/or other team members from MF the ability to 1. Join existing operational cells, 2. Propose creating and operating in new cells, 3. Participate as contributors (coordination scale) in the project. 

Having operational roles to play in the project would give them first hand DAO experience in addition to the learning and insights that would come out of the project itself. 
	- Likewise, they could be involved in Windfall or AIFS either via the RP project or separately if that made sense. My initial preference would be to do it through the RP project as we are designing the mechanisms for stakeholder partnerships in the project itself and we will also be onboarding members from the other partners into the Web3 world anyway, so adding MF folk to this would be easier than doing it separately through other work. But this can all be figured out as we understand the opportunity better. 
	- 


- Windfall Project
	- Join in to stakeholder group around windfall project (or linking the appropriate link for Australia

i think she understsands digital leadership platform as what's being built with the startup they refernces, which is basically org practice toolkits for large orgs from what I can tell. 

'sandpits' seem to refer to conceptual areas rather than the supporting implementation/local projects in practice.

i'm not sure what 'replicating their platform' means, but the second question of her reframing: "What is the engine required to drive this change process, in terms of the mechanism for citizens to convene and the capability platform that supports this engagement" is what we proposed. I think a disconnect might be that they seem to be less interested in practical support and in favour of knowledge development and disemination. that would also explain some of the tension in the last call.

so, maybe we can carve out the clarity of practical community support form of 'sandpits', using the windfall example as that has partners they would understand, and rather than rely on them to launch the global network, we say we are scaling this sanbox capacity to global local foundations and philantrhopies globally. what i'm not sure yet, is how to reframe the funding participation, but maybe that can wait till after the call. 

practically, i think that email is good to go, maybe shift "You can see our team as web3 weavers into the local projects that would walk alongside these projects." to "You can see our team as hands-on capacity and infrastructure to weave web3 enabled coordination, governance, and self-determination into these local and allied projects."
Jumping on a phone call sounds like a great next step!
Thanks for an energizing conversation this week and the spirit of action and collaboration that we landed at as next steps. In that spirit here are some possible points of collaboration
To start Liz I wanted to be sure you had this briefing note about the Reimagining Power project.
**Reimagining Power Project Purpose: **To explore how web3 can shift power, transform systems and shape better futures. In particular, how the concept of DAOs as purpose driven networks of small autonomous teams can redistribute power, value flows and resources across society at scale.
Here are some suggested points of collaboration:
**As a stakeholder**- there is an opportunity for Menzies Foundation to join the stakeholder group. This would be in partnership with the existing stakeholders including SuperBenefit DAO, All In For Sport, Equality Fund, Ontario Trillium Foundation. The Regen Melbourne and work with Indigenous communities could be additional experiments as part of the Reimagining Power project.
**As a financial contributor**- contribute financially to Philanthropy Playbook #2 that outlines experiments (AIFS, Equality Fund, Reimagine Institute, Menzies Foundation) with case studies, learning and application to philanthropy and philanthropic models/systems. 
**As operational contributors **- you or those in your network with Menzies Foundation could 
a. Join existing operational cells
2. Propose creating and operating in new cellsb. Participate as contributors (coordination scale) in the project. 
Having operational roles to play in the project would give  first hand DAO experience in addition to the learning and insights that would come out of the project itself. 
**As a global convenor**- If appropriate, can then propose/launch the global philanthropy and web3 network as a follow-on project/playbooks.
We would be excited to connect on these potential roles and points of collaboration as the shared learning in this global context would be tremendous! And your let's get to it aligns so happy to connect soon.

Email from Liz Gillies - 
Thanks for the email –
I am interested in considering all suggested options – but would need more detail regarding funding expectations associated with our engagement.
Ideally the Menzies Foundation funding would support:
- the development of Web 3 initiatives on the ground in the context of our work – which would contribute to the ongoing development of the Reimaging Power Project (RPP) AND
- the secretariat functions of the RPP to support the incubation, codification and scaling of the platform which would include convening a global network.

Very interested in your thoughts about how best to structure this – and the resources required for the secretariat support.
 
Email Draft to Liz Gillies
Hello Liz

Thanks for your interest in all the suggested options and happy to hop on a quick call to discuss.

For the development of Web 3 initiatives on the ground in the context of your work – which would contribute to the ongoing development of the Reimagining Power Project (RPP). 

- We could engage 3 projects that align with the Reimagining Power Project from your region and support, test, co-learn and co-harvest across all the experiments and integrate into the models and playbook. Ontario Trillium Foundation is supporting the project at $100K for this level of engagement. We could put a briefing note together to outline.


For the secretariat functions of the RPP to support the incubation, codification and scaling of the platform which would include convening a global network.

- We could have a design call to find clarity on this idea and/or this could unfold as we work together on the above.



We are excited and open to exploring this more. Look forward to hearing from you.

Version 2
Hey gang, sorry I have been away camping for the weekend so slow to get back on this. 

Yep, I agree on keeping it simple. Much easier to give Liz the high-level then fill in the detail of how to implement it as part of the project. Otherwise it's too much conceptual detail for her to understand in the short term. 

So for the first one (e.g 100k to spin up 3 or more projects), it could be two possibilities to explore - either 1. having them join the RPP, or 2. us helping them to implement this separately (but sharing learnings from/with the RPP). Which of these to choose can be figured out as part of the project. This approach means that the process of working this out becomes part of the learning of the project - requiring us to go deeper into the governance design etc, rather than having to do all of this up front. 
The secretariat bit I am less sure about. Do you think there is a definite ask that we can deliver on here? Or is is more that we could hlep them to explore what this might look like. It feels like a longer design conversation that would happen over time as Liz and her people build there understanding of the Web3 landscape. But you might be seeing something more concrete and deliverable here?

# Proposal Outline
As a follow on to the paper "Designing Web3 Financial Innovations for Social Change" this proposal is outlining the opportunity to collaborate to pilot and apply new collective coordination primitives to test and demonstrate financial innovations that are place based in your region.
The purpose is to explore how web3 can shift power, transform systems and shape better futures. In particular, how the concept of DAOs as** ****_purpose driven networks of small autonomous teams_** can redistribute power, value flows and resources across society at scale.****

## **Project Summary**
Building on the foundations being established through the Reimagining Power Project we are excited to collaborate with Menzies Foundation in the following ways:
1. **Coordination Pilots**
We will support the coordination primitive pilots for 3 additional projects, nominated by Menzies Foundation. For each project we would:
	- Design and establish their coordination primitives and infrastructure
	- Experiment with applying methodologies and DAO principles in three aligned projects
	- Povide 6 months of implementation coaching and support
	- After which they should be self-reliant, but at anytime a further proposal could be submitted for additional support
2. **Philanthropy Secretariat**
We will host and support the coordination of a philanthropy secretariat. This will include:
	- Coordination primitive design and infrastructure setup
	- Convening a community of ecosystem participants around the work taking place in the Reimagining Power project and specific Menzies Foundation sponsored projects outlined above. This can consist of hosting regular open conversations, learning salons, twitter spaces etc and will include:
		- Other philanthropic organisations interested in the Web3 space
		- Current Web3 projects and organisations that are working towards aligned goals
		- A broader community of individuals from Web3 and from the broader philanthropic and non-profit communities
	- Ongoing secretariat hosting for 6 months including:
		- monthly calls
		- asynchronous chat room monitoring and hosting
		- up to 3 learning salons
	- After which the secretariat could submit a proposal for ongoing support

Budget: $100,000 (matching the Ontario Trillium Foundation contribution)
The benefits of joining through the Reimagining Power project are:
- Benefit ongoing learning including playbook development currently underway
- Pilot projects benefit from cross-learning with existing pilot projects
- Tap into the Reimagining Power project philanthropic network
- The opportunity to bring forward additional proposals to the overall project
- Participation in governance across the whole project

Further, by aligning our work, it is assumed that together, we will be stronger, build momentum and be able to rally additional resources into advancing the next phase of our collective work.
## **Project Streams**
*These are proposed streams, the scope and work will be determined through an emergent learning process.
**Design Phase for the DAO Governance Model **
Potential Components of the Governance Design Phase:
- **Purpose and Insight:** Transformation Mapping using the _Three Horizons_ Model
- **Community governance:** designing the larger community governance mechanism that will wrap the operational structures of the network
- **Operational governance:** designing the coordination primitives (including the Cell primitive) that allow the network to form useful and efficient operating structures
- **Resource, Treasury and Capital Model:** developing mechanisms for managing the flows of information and resources across the network
- **Governance support:** supporting community proposals to drive new activity across the network
- **Operational support:** best practice and tooling to help Cells to manage coordination and decision-making across the operational network of Cells

**Research & Documentation:**
- Documenting the learning and insights of the three aligned projects and integrating into the community governance playbook. 
- Overview of examples of web3 applied toward intentional positive outcomes, including Impact DAOs, crypto philanthropy models, granting and investing mechanisms.

**Prototyping & Iteration Phase:**
- Apply the DAO Governance model in three aligned projects experiments. Mobilizing and allocating capital in more equitable and distributed ways: shifting from traditional, donor-centric models of philanthropy to new approaches which center power and decision making in the hands of proximate change makers.
- Iterating and refining the DAO Community Governance framework and toolset so that it can be easily reused and evolved. Open-sourcing all designs so that others can utilize them in similar projects and can extend this work into new areas. 

**Sensemaking & Knowledge Sharing: **
- Share the learning process through blogs and other storytelling opportunities 
- Publish the _DAO Community Governance Playbook_ under [creative commons attribution share-alike license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/) . 

**Engagement of Philanthropy and Foundations:**
- Establish the Philanthropic Secretariat
- Monthly meetings and Chat Channel set up and facilitated
- Coordination and facilitation of up to 3 DAOs and Philanthropy Salon, see concept [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s-Ro04GMFSKd_gq6RDCDm_7xATPUhyDxretQ1CSm2EI/edit).

## **Anticipated Results**
*note due to the collective coordination the anticipated results will be shaped by the decisions and direction of the aligned project teams
- Developed infrastructure to support three DAOs in philanthropic and social purpose contexts
- Experiment with applying methodologies and DAO principles in three aligned projects
