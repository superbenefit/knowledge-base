- **Next steps -** The RPP team will:

  - Translate the progress from the session into a sharable writeup. 

  - Work up some possible experimental options based on web3 coordination patterns and tooling

  - Set up another meeting to discuss these (with Sue or whomever Sue nominates from EF)

**Equality fund scoping call note (from Rowan)**

- Filling a gap because many Woman's orgs around the world can't apply for funding. Emergency response funding is on example. This is a parallel funding stream

- Prepare funding stream

 Collaborative opportunities are prioritised - grants of $1mil to 6-7 orgs  

 4 categories - visionary capacity, warning systems, political building, narrative change

 Part of the feminist approach is the visionary/reimagining approach

 Calls for EOI went out in June, eligibility quiz and 6 questions - received 1000 now down to 400. Looking to invite 50-60 applications to select 6-7 - budget 7mil total

 Decision criteria at each stage - currently building criteria for the full application assessment

 Using a traditional advisory body approach for selection. They fund urgent action feminist funds separately (4 around the world)

 For the advisory body - need different skillsets and languages (6 people)

 They do reference checks - 1 from previous donors and one from feminist ecosystem

 The final approval of the funding - legally the EF needs to approve the final funding. The CEO approves the docket - the docket is created in a meeting with the advisory group and staff working on the applications make a recommendation. This docket is always approved. More a legal. 

 "We are nowhere close enough to the context of the where the funding is needed"

 Need a funding process that has integrity but doesn't overwhelm people

 Priorities come from the 4 buckets on the prepare side. They are committed to these priorities as well as things like the geographic element. This happened in the 1000-400 process. And then they continue to be sensitive to these priorities throughout the process. They are taking a Portfolio approach and this plays out throughout this system

 The funding comes from investment returns as well from philanthropic, government etc. Donors don't get to decide what is funded. 

 Process to get the funds to the recipients, happens after the docket approval. This is the dispersal process

 It's complicated to get funds through international processes - e.g anti terrorists approval process, 

 There is a grant agreement - the recipient has to state how they are going to use the money

 The money moves differently depending on the org and their country/currency etc 

 "There is a whole process of repeatedly reporting on grants to releasing more fund that is up for reimagining "

- There is a desert of knowledge of web3 in the EF - it would be good for the SB folks to work on ideas and then we can start to narrow in to ACTUALLY DO AN EXPERIMENT. 

- SB will need sync up with Sue to make sure that the ideation phase is efficient 

- Sue will share the details or the of the questionairs etc for the design process. 

- The advisory body are acknowledged as being not enough (diversity, knowledge etc)

- There is a process of "Rumbles" between small groups to assess and debate the selection process 

- Question - what can be done with/for the 1000 applicants in the system? - they keep them in the system and send things there way. 

 Think about data analytics as a service to the community! How can we unlock collective intelligence across the community?

- One important filter is the value that this can unlock to others in the community 

- Sue is keen to ideate with us. OS stewards team can meet tomorrow and decide a path forward

- Sue will share a slide deck with more detail tomorrow.

Using data analytics as a service to the community.

How can we unlock collective intelligence cross the community

who owns data, who decides what to do with it

Notes 

		Building an additional funding stream alongside the existing institutions, supporting feminist organizations engaging in collaborative projects. They give a small amount of grants at \~1MM each.

	They create thematic buckets of grants and call out to applicants to share how they're working in the space (visionary capacity, warning systems, political building, narrative change)

	Using crisis response as an opportunity to reimagine systems to promote equity

	They are a broad-scope org, working with crisis experts

	Making sure that funding systems are grounded in movements

funds are mixed from interal and external sources

- eligibility for grantees

- eligibility for validators

  - RW experience in field

- evaluate

  - Call for expressions of interest. Applicants submit information about their project.

  - thousands of applicants are filtered down to 400 or so

    - Try to network applicants to the right opportunities

    - criticized for not working with more partners - rejected apps sometimes have feedback

    - They do long grant agreements (2 to 5-10 years) so many aren't compatible

    - calls for proposals are expensive; Can't afford to engage more partners

    - Need to make application flow better and more equitable

  - Prioritizing based on 4 buckets and other considerations like geographic distribution

- propose

  - team of 6 advisors

    - Needs to be more representative

    - Not sufficient, but well planned within means

      - They have tools, guidelines and checklists in place

    - Teams collaborate on evaluations, then switch dockets

    - Despite difficulties, advisors enjoy and want to re-engage

    - relational infrastructure is key

    - 

  - Proposes docket of recipients

- decide

  - Decision by ceo; accountable to board

  - Typically is affirmative and non-contentious

  - "Did we end up with the same docket you'd have picket personally?" - No.

  - 

- constantly moving money, making decisions, shifting things, using various processes

- execute

  - pain points

    - burning time on report discrepancies due to forex

    - tracking multiple currencies

    - Paying too much on fees

    - room for innovation in funding cycle efficiency

  - many checks around intl transactions, throughout cycle

  - anti-terrorism checklist, etc. - checked while building docket

  - Meet with recipient for onboarding and review of grant agreement

    - The propose plan for using funds

    - EF needs to know how money will be used

  - Disbursement 

    - Money moves different ways, currencies, etc depending on needs

NotesOutline docContext:We have 1 hour for the call with members of the RP core team and Sue Snider from Equality FundThere has already been some discovery work done to explore EF's current processes. So we are not starting fresh and don't require an initial broad mapping step. We can go straight to the specific areas that EF want to explore. In the call we will not be trying to actually scope an experiment. We are aiming to discover potential opportunities that we can explore and scope in the steps that follow the call.Goals for the callTo build a shared understanding of the specific areas of the EF grant-making process that they would like to experiment on. To identify the high potential areas of intervention To understand the scope that an experiment might cover (time, resources etc)To explore early experiment ideas to consider  During the call we will attempt to answer the following questions:What is the specific problem space that Equality fund are trying to address?Map the specific problem space that has been surfaced in previous discovery conversations and get to a solid shared understanding of what EF is trying to approachDo this in notes or in FigjamWhat are the systemic issues present in the existing system? How does EF's current approach attempt to navigate existing systems of power?What risks are aspects of the current system trying to protect against?Across the different flows that have been mapped above, what aspects are changeable and unchangeableWhere can agency, voice, power etc be distributed differently in the system?How might this make the system more efficient, robust, equitable, collectively intelligent etc?What capacity and resources does Equality Fund have to contribute into the experiment and how would they like to participate?What early ideas exist for patterns that could be experimented on to transform this aspect of Equality Funds practice?  (include input from the RPP team on possible approaches)	Next stepsThe RPP team will: Translate the progress from the session into a sharable writeup. Work up some possible experimental options based on web3 coordination patterns and toolingSet up another meeting to discuss these (with Sue or whomever Sue nominates from EF)
