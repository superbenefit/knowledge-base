    - Digital Supercluster

      - CFC has been meeting with Digital Supercluster https://www.digitalsupercluster.ca/ and right after our SB GC where you were talking about AI agents and web3 I literally got this message as a follow up to our last meeting...

      - "Michelle, in addition to various AI and data ideas, if I recall correctly, you mentioned on the call that you've been doing some work around blockchain? Could you elaborate on that? Some time ago we explored the combination of Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) + AI Agents (although that didn't turn into a separate DIGITAL program) and I wonder if there's anything on that front, given the rapid progress in both areas and their application in the not-for-profit sector."

    - Agent deployment: We need an openai api key for short-term work. Can anyone grab one for SB and share the key with me? (it won't take my prepaid card) - It's $20

      - 

- EF funding + EF next steps (heenal)

  - They have perhaps 10k they can contribute to RPP

  - Sue & Nicole will map the financial flow & pain points (including transfer fees, delays, bureaucracy, etc) then RPP team will map an equivalent (but better/cheaper) flow on-chain

  - Then RP team will map the potential crypto flow that could solve for their pain points and out of this we will build the experiment

- [ICS Experiment Scoping](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/wip-ics-experiment-scoping-0011477827223125292) (heenal)

  - doc updated. please take a look and add comments this week. thank you :)

- Check in on yield fund idea (rowan)

  - 

- CFP: "Nature-Centrism as a Lens for Organizational Behavior and Decision-Making" - $500k+ - due Feb 3 (heenal)

## Concept note outline for AI agent project - for funding applications

Background

Rationale

Project

- Engaging stakeholders re: learning about agents

- Eco-agents: mapping the landscape and possibilities

- community knowledge swarms: deploying community agents to create an infinite front porch

Opportunity - to create a partnership between SB, AIFS and other partners like OpenCivics. Each org creates an AI agent to wrap their docs and frameworks. Then we create a swarm out of the agents to make a resource for building DAOs etc.

Pitch the idea that we have been working on outreach to stakeholders and community for 2 years through SB, RPP & AIFS. We are now going to operationalize agents to make a lot of the resources we have created accessible to all and able to connect and communicate with one another to integrate collective wisdom and provide answers to difficult questions.

Outline what is important about the crypto rails piece. This is not possible any other way. Liberate community and org data in a way that protects their ownership of the data, makes it valuable to others, and potentially makes the sharing of it valuable to the org sharing it via the agent swarm.

# Summary

- The group discussed the potential of using AI agents to enable data interoperability and sovereignty across organizations while retaining control over their data.

- They explored the idea of creating a 'swarm' of AI agents representing different organizations' knowledge bases that could interact and share information.

- The possibility of applying for grants, such as the Future of Life grant, to fund the development of AI agents and knowledge sharing mechanisms was discussed.

- The group considered proposing a small research project to gather and document existing nature-centric AI initiatives as a potential grant application.

- They discussed the idea of setting up a yield fund to attract traditional organizations into crypto by offering short-term excess returns while funding novel resource allocation mechanisms.

- The group explored the potential of collaborating with organizations like the Carolian Canadian Coalition to demonstrate impact measurement and attribution for the yield fund.

- The conversation touched on the need to clearly articulate the deployment and impact of funding to potential partners and funders.

- The group discussed the possibility of using the yield fund as a stepping stone to attract more funding for developing community-distributed funding mechanisms on crypto rails.

Minutesüìù OS Stewards Weekly Meeting Notes üïû Started at 02:01 PM on 28 Jan, lasted 1h 37mCreating AI Agents for Knowledge SharingThe group discussed creating AI agents to represent and share knowledge from different organizations' documentation and knowledge bases.This would allow sovereign data ownership while enabling interoperability and knowledge sharing across organizations.Rather than trying to coordinate a complex protocol for sharing knowledge gardens directly, each organization could create an AI agent trained on their knowledge.Then, they could use swarm protocols to allow the agents to communicate and share information.This approach eliminates the need for manual coordination of knowledge sharing, as the agents can interface with each other programmatically.It allows organizations to maintain control over their data while still enabling collaborative knowledge exchange.The group sees this as a major breakthrough that could enable interoperability of semi-structured data pools that have been siloed.It provides a potential self-sovereign business model for organizations to monetize their knowledge assets.They discussed using this approach internally first, creating agents for different Super Benefit knowledge bases before expanding to partner organizations.The goal would be to demonstrate the value of the approach for philanthropic and non-profit knowledge sharing.Funding Opportunities for AI ProjectsThe group reviewed several potential funding opportunities related to AI projects, including grants from the Future of Life Institute and Digital Supercluster.For the Future of Life grant due in one week, they discussed proposing a small research project to catalog existing nature-centric AI initiatives and agents.This would provide value by organizing scattered knowledge in the field, rather than proposing a large new project on a short timeline.They see an opportunity to position their work on AI agent swarms and knowledge sharing as filling a gap in the non-profit/philanthropic space around data sovereignty and interoperability.The group plans to create a concept note outlining their AI agent swarm approach that can be used to apply for various funding opportunities and explain the value proposition to partners like Michelle.Yield Fund Concept DevelopmentThe group continued refining their concept for a yield fund that would leverage higher crypto yields to fund impact projects and Super Benefit's work.They discussed concerns that the higher yields are likely a short-term anomaly that will normalize over time as the market matures.This impacts the long-term viability of the model.Rather suggested focusing more on clearly articulating how funds would be deployed and how impacts would be measured, as this seems to be a key concern for potential funders like Bowen.They explored a model where a small percentage (1-2%) of yields would go to Super Benefit to fund their work, while the bulk would go to established impact organizations with robust measurement frameworks.The group sees this as a potential compromise that could work for more traditional funders in the short term, while allowing Super Benefit to continue developing more innovative funding models for the future.Equality Fund CollaborationFor the Equality Fund collaboration, Sue and Nicole are working on mapping out traditional financial flows and pain points.Super Benefit will then map equivalent flows on blockchain to demonstrate potential improvements.Drafting Formal Concept NoteRather offered to take the notes and transcript from this meeting and use an AI tool (Claude) to draft a more formal concept note for the AI agent swarm project that can be used for funding applications.The group plans to continue refining the yield fund concept to pitch to Bowen and potentially other funders, positioning it as a way to leverage short-term higher yields while building capacity for more innovative funding approaches.
