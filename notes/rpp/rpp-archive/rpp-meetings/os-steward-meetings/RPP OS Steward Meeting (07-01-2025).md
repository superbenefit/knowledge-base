# Meeting Agenda

Weekly meeting agenda & notes for the RPP Operation & Strategy Stewards team.

## Updates

- Open civics opening up its network database - opportunity to add in RPP, gatherings etc

## Discussion Items

- What's up with the group Rowan's working in? How can we support? Does Rowan need funding?

- ICS Experiment

  - [ICS Discovery Report](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/ics-experiment-discovery-29166163934225553)

  - Proposal to send 350 USDC to Corduroy Earth (via ICS) for consulting on localism and to support web3 panel at event on January 19

    - This can be a potential case study on how a local fiscal steward can support the coordination of local contributors and partners 

- From GC meeting - The OS stewards will talk through the BOANN opportunity then set up a short call with Michael to discuss BOANN as well as the SB wrap up of the Windfall project. Then we'll update Michelle so she can frame up the Jan 21 meeting. Rowan reach out to Michael.

  - Boann is looking for a **portfolio**, **index** or **derivative**.

  - Possibility for BOANN to contribute a little funding (say 20k) and pair this with the next round of OTF funding to work on this. 

  - BOANN is bringing on team member who is experienced in web3. This project could be a good use of this person's time. 

  - Pitch a small engagement 

  - We would be convening people who are building infrastructure, this could be the first round of investible opportunities. This could provide for BOANN's desire for investable opportunities.

- Discuss Tequio and what it looks like for us to get to an updated and refined narrative for what we are doing at SB/RPP - helping us understand protocolized political systems. 

  - Community convening function (for BOANN etc)

  - Purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams in an unstable world (including rapid AI advancement)

    - How can we more clearly articulate the value of this in today's world?

    - Centralized AI companies want to sell AI as being this one big scary thing, rather than it being lots of things that together can be useful (or can be dangerous and scary). AI agents can expand capacity from the bottom up. Can facilitate coordination and liberation. Humans making decisions, AI agents executing on them.

  - Why are blockchains (crypto) a thing that philanthropic orgs should care about?

- Should we do something with AI agents/AI DAO tooling for RPP?

-  Playbooks - 

  - Review current progress and plan

  - look at [Playbook cell set up task](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/create-an-ephemeral-cell-for-playbook-contributor-collaboration-08171440932784968) and main Playbooks task   - when cell state (in setup task) is good, move to main playbooks task and onboard contributors

  - Review [Community Governance Playbook task](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/community-governance-playbook-rpp-8010900790578133)

- Documentation 

  - Review and feedback on docs

# Decision Log

- Decided to approve the sending of 350USDC to ICS to send on to Corduroy Earth

---

# Summary

- Heenal proposed sending $350 USDC to Cora Youth via ICS for their collaboration and upcoming event in London.

- The group discussed framing their conversation with Michael from Bowen to explore the possibility of Bowen funding a partnership to research and create a portfolio, index, or derivative for investing in regenerative projects.

- Rowan raised the idea of updating the Super Benefit narrative and articulating the value proposition of blockchain technology for philanthropic organizations in the context of the evolving Web3 space.

- The group discussed the potential of leveraging AI agents and tooling for the Regenerative Playbook Project (RPP), such as building an agent to interact with the playbook documentation.

- Rowan highlighted the importance of articulating the concept of 'purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams' and how it relates to the rapid advancement of AI and the future of work.

- The group discussed the need to clarify the role of blockchain technology in providing affordances for different stakeholder groups and enabling coordination across social differences in resource allocation.

- Rowan and Rather reviewed the progress on the Playbook cell setup and the Community Governance Playbook task, aiming to move the cell state into the main Playbooks RPP task.

- The group touched upon the potential of using AI agents and tooling like Citizen Chat to make the playbook documentation more accessible and interactive.

Minutesüìù OS Stewards Weekly Meeting Notes üïû Started at 01:59 PM on 07 Jan, lasted 1h 59mICS Experiment ProgressHeenal proposed sending 350 USDC to ICS to be forwarded to Cordoy Earth.This funding would help strengthen the relationship with Cordoy Earth, who has been collaborating on local initiatives.The group agreed this was a good start and could help shape up future deliverables and funding opportunities.Rather noted this could serve as a compelling case study for the playbooks, highlighting the importance of local fiscal stewards in facilitating resource coordination.The group discussed the potential for ICS to expand its role as a local hub, coordinating resources between various local nodes and groups.Engagement with BOANN and Super Benefit CapabilitiesThe group recalled previous discussions about Super Benefit potentially acting as a convening entity to pull together partners, including Bowen, for interesting projects like creating a fund.Rather clarified that Boann was specifically looking for a portfolio, index, or derivative, and suggested focusing on how to include projects like Windfall in such financial instruments.The group explored the idea of convening various partners to explore these possibilities, leveraging the current state of the regenerative finance ecosystem where many participants are mission-driven.They discussed the potential for a small, safe engagement (around $20,000) that could be wrapped into a larger ask from OTF (Open Technology Fund), combining learnings and infrastructure development.Role of AI and Blockchain TechnologyThe group explored the idea of using AI agents or tools for RPP (Regenerative Protocol Primitives) purposes, such as creating a chatbot to interact with their documentation and playbooks.Rather suggested looking into platforms like Citizen Chat, which can work with Markdown files and allow for hierarchical nesting of different datasets.The group discussed the potential for using AI for tasks like translation and making their documentation more accessible to non-English speakers.They touched on the emerging trends in AI and crypto, including the rapid developments happening in communities like AI 16 Z.The conversation included reflections on the potential for decentralized social media platforms like Farcaster and Lens to facilitate AI agent interactions and economic mechanisms.Playbook Development ProgressThe group reviewed the progress on the community governance playbook task and discussed how to structure the content.Rather suggested organizing the playbook into concise sections with links to more detailed information, allowing for easy updates and expansions over time.They discussed the need to create a comprehensive list of patterns and primitives to reference in the playbook.Rowan and Rather agreed to schedule a follow-up meeting to review the group state template, group state pattern, and cell state for the ephemeral cell to ensure they are on track with the desired level of information and structure.
