# Meeting Agenda

Weekly meeting agenda & notes for the RPP Operation & Strategy Stewards team.

## Updates

- First draft of AIFS narrative from BorrowLucid. Probably not what we're looking for. How to adjust? 

  - [https://hackmd.io/dQRIJo-nT3iECQgbzZV9Vg?view](https://hackmd.io/dQRIJo-nT3iECQgbzZV9Vg?view)

  - Rather will check with Shanny & BorrowLucid about a call to sync up on AIFS Storytelling - maybe next Monday or the following Monday

## Discussion Items

- Work through the playbooks operational plan  

  - Include others who want to contribute

  - Confirm PB stewards role (proposal)  

  - Find out who is up for becoming a Playbooks Steward

- Discuss options for additional deliverables that could be funded...  Possibly from BOANN Finance. Social finance wholesaler (who Michelle has met with) 

  - Something related to the impact investing space - perhaps write more on impact investing - or propose an experiment that we could run in the impact investing space. 

  - MB - A knowledge product, connected to impact investing or addition to the playbooks - and a related experiment

    - Challenges - impact investing is not popular in the crypto space. Is there a conversation we could have around something that is more interesting in the web3 space. Perhaps investing in hypercerts to fund impact activities. Or thinking about funding protocols that can spin up network effects around an impactful activity (e.g windfall), i.e you only get a return if the network succeeds and delivers impact. 

    - There could be fit in BioFi - finding ways to get capital into land/ecosystems in a way that can benefit from the increase in value but in a way that is protected via a trust (or similar) that prevents investors from getting control of the assets. 

- ICS Experiment - setup some basic infra for ICS (their safes, ENS, etc)? Choosing, deploying and configuring their basic contracts. (heenal)

  - safe multi-sig

    - think about who we want the signers to be

      - don't necessarily need board on there, could be an operational thing

    - think about internal procedures

  - ENS - what name?

  - optional hats tree setup

  - think about internal structure - how community governance will work, if we're going to use cells, roles, tasks, etc

- Comp requests from Gatherings

- Discuss rather's Open Civics update from discord

- Need help to process payment (rowan)

Minutesüìù OS Stewards Weekly Meeting Notesüïû Started at xx:xx PM on ?? Oct, lasted ?h ?mPlaybook Steward Role AllocationThe group discussed allocating the playbook steward's role to Rowan and Rather, to be held within the OS Stewards team initially.This approach aims to maintain a single collaboration group and avoid creating a separate team that would require additional context-building and sense-making.The role holders will be responsible for packaging tasks for contributors like Jose to work on.Compensation for the playbook steward's role will be claimed separately from the OS Stewards role, with individuals adjusting their claims based on the work done in each capacity.This arrangement allows for flexibility in managing workload and compensation across different responsibilities while staying within budget constraints.The group agreed to create separate contribution records for playbook steward work to track spending accurately.ICS Experiment Infrastructure SetupThe group discussed setting up basic infrastructure for the ICS experiment.They decided to start with creating a multi-signature wallet (multisig) for ICS, with Heenal as the primary signer.Rather offered to set up the multisig and register an Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain for ICS.They settled on 'communitysustainability.eth' as the ENS name, registering it for two years.The process involved some technical challenges with gas fees and wallet configurations.The multisig was successfully created, and the ENS name was registered and transferred to the ICS safe address.The group discussed the need for Heenal to add other signers to the multisig once they have their hardware wallet set up.This infrastructure setup marks the beginning of ICS's on-chain presence and ability to conduct transactions.Impact Investing Project IdeasThe group explored ideas for projects related to impact investing that could potentially be funded by Bowen Finance or other social finance wholesalers.They discussed the challenges and negative perceptions associated with impact investing, acknowledging that while there are good people in the space, many impact investors are perceived as being as profit-driven as traditional investors.The group considered ideas such as retroactive funding for regenerative networks, funding open protocols that generate network effects, and exploring concepts like hyper-search impact bonds.They emphasized the importance of finding projects that align with their values and create real-world positive outcomes, rather than just offering financial returns.The discussion highlighted the need to carefully navigate the space between traditional impact investing and more innovative approaches in crypto, such as quadratic funding and retroactive funding.All for Sport Project UpdatesRather shared a first draft of updates from Barra Lucid for the All for Sport project.The group found the writing to be well-crafted and emotionally evocative but struggled to connect it directly to the mission of All for Sport.They discussed the need for the narrative to more clearly articulate the project's goals, such as overcoming injustices or transforming communities through sport.The group suggested setting up a call with Barra Lucid and potentially including Shanny to provide more context and direction for future drafts.They appreciated the writer's ability to create engaging content but felt it needed to be more explicitly tied to the project's objectives and the concept of community organizations managing capital for local projects.Technical Infrastructure UpdatesThe group discussed several technical infrastructure updates.They considered moving funds from the rewards safe to their regular Optimism safe due to issues with the current version of Hat SignerGate.Rather mentioned that buying an ENS with a Safe can be challenging and suggested alternative methods for registering and transferring ENS names.They discussed the need to troubleshoot issues with the snapshot space and potentially add themselves to the safe to facilitate easier management of technical issues.The group noted the high cost of registering certain ENS names, particularly short or desirable ones, and discussed strategies for managing these costs.These technical discussions highlighted the ongoing challenges and considerations in managing decentralized infrastructure and the importance of staying updated with the latest tools and best practices in the space.
