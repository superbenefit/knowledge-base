The meeting focused on defining and operationalizing the Strategy & Operations Steward role for the Reimagining Power Project (RPP). Key points discussed include:

### Role Definition and Responsibilities

- The Strategy & Operations Steward role is designed to advance the strategic and operational aspects of RPP, ensuring alignment with the core team's purpose and strategy.

- Responsibilities include developing and implementing strategies, engaging contributors, managing tasks and projects, and providing regular updates to the core team.

- Stewards commit to 6 hours of work per week, including 4 hours of focused work and 2 hours of shared work time.

### Governance and Decision-Making

- The team emphasized the need for the Steward team to have sufficient decision-making authority to avoid delays.

- A system where roles and responsibilities are clearly defined and changes to roles require consent from all role holders was proposed.

- Stewards will have collective discretionary spending authority for expenses over $2500 and individual authority to spend up to $4800 per month on role compensation.

### Operational Dynamics

- The Steward team will operate with a flexible, evolving structure, adapting to the needs and capacities of its members.

- A proposed structure includes a maximum of four members, with the ability to add or replace members as needed.

- Importance of shared work time and collaboration to ensure effective management and decision-making was highlighted.

### Trial Period and Reflection

- The initiative will begin with a one-month trial to assess the effectiveness of the new governance structure, allowing for adjustments based on practical experiences.

- Regular reflection and reassessment are planned to ensure the structure continues to meet project needs and adapt to changes in capacity or focus.

### Challenges and Considerations

- Discussions included the need for clarity in distinguishing the Steward role from the core team to avoid redundancy.

- The importance of having the Steward team reflect on its capacity and effectiveness, and make necessary adjustments based on feedback from the core team.

In conclusion, the meeting aimed to establish a clear, flexible, and effective governance structure for the Strategy & Operations Steward role within the RPP, ensuring it supports the core teamâ€™s goals while allowing for efficient decision-making and adaptability.
