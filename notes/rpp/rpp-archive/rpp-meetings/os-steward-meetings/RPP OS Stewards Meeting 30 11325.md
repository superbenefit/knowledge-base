  - what is problem we are trying to solve, a shiny solution? 

  - recurring revenue for SB? is this the right model?

  - how do impact areas fit into the network we are currently in

  - we know capital that wants to do things on chain, benefit ecosystem and us 

  - could be its own cell

 

## Discussion Items

- Ongoing funding for RPP/SB 

  - What is the list of potential funding opportunities? 

  - What will we do if we can't secure ongoing funding?

  - We can attract revenue based on the outputs of the RPP - playbooks and overall narrative that we are producing. Link our outputs to clear outcomes that people would want to engage with and fund. E.g create regen hubs - superbenefit can provide playbook resources and facilitation for creating and supporting hubs. 

  - We will need to decide on what opportunities are open to us based on the work we have done in RPP. What "products or services" will partners be prepared to fund that SB can support with resources and facilitation

  - We could coordinate with other DAOs that could present opportunities for SB. These are harder to spot but could be valuable -  

  - **Framing up the opportunities for funders **

    - Create a map of SB and all of the our projects to demonstrate the value that SB creates and the dynamics by which it works. Do this as an output of RPP

    - Mapping usecases that meed needs of potential partners - possible create an e.g 5k per year SLA where a partner can access the benefits of SB to help the understand, experiment with and implement initiatives in communities based on our tools and expertise

    - Possibility of framing up us supporting bio-regional hubs. SB could incubate them and provide ingoing support e.g fiscal sponsorship, governance support etc. This could create an ongoing income stream for SB. Looking for the value proposition... e.g what value might this create for an org like ICS, also what value could it create for stakeholders like EF or OTF. When we wrap up the ICS experiment we can include some analysis on what ongoing value this could offer to our stakeholders

- EF Experiment?

- AIFS Governance updates / experiments

  - What considerations do we need to make at SB?

  - What facilitation does AIFS need for this transition?

  - How are we approaching reporting/study on experiment?

- Timelines & Capacities 

- **_Longer Items:_**
