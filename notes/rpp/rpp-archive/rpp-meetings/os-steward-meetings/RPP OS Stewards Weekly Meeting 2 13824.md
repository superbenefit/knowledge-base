During the meeting, participants shared personal updates and feelings. Rather expressed feeling scatterbrained and behind on tasks, while also mentioning a difficult personal day. Filsan mentioned having a rocky start to the day due to lack of sleep and feeling nervous about the call. Michelle discussed her upcoming plans to pick up her son from a surfing competition in Raglan.The group discussed how they wanted to run the meeting, with an emphasis on covering updates, discussion items from Discord conversations, finalizing role descriptions, addressing operational roadblocks, deciding on priorities for projects, project task management strategies as well as partnership summaries.A miscommunication regarding meeting times was acknowledged between members who agreed to find an alternative time slot that would accommodate everyone's schedules.Strategy and Coordination Discussions
There was an extensive conversation around strategy during which Rowan highlighted that Discord is suitable for asynchronous work but emphasized separating momentum from emotion when reading through discussions there. The need for generating momentum within their work was stressed by several members who felt that progress had been hindered by differing perspectives.Rather suggested starting with updates to lead into a conversation about the channel. They emphasized the importance of enabling constraints such as the check-in and decider protocols, which allow for flexibility in dealing with complexity within a small team. The group discussed how these protocols can be used effectively to ensure psychological safety and equal participation. Rather also explained the purpose of creating a coordinating task to consolidate all work related to the steward role.The team discussed using a specific task as a means of organizing various operational responsibilities within their roles. They highlighted that this approach allows them to track and manage all relevant work collectively, ensuring clarity on current tasks, responsibilities, evaluation, and reporting.There was deliberation on structuring coordination through role holders signing up for specific tasks while also allowing for flexibility by indicating collective tracking without claiming domain over specific tasks.Rather acknowledged a communication dissonance within the core team and expressed regret for not approaching the situation with more empathy and intuition. rowanyeoman@gmail.com emphasized the importance of addressing emotions in discussions through a check-in protocol to prevent hidden derailments. The discussion highlighted the need for psychological safety to express emotions openly, leading to faster progress.Rather summarized that strategic needs were intentionally waiting for action within the core team. mbaldwin@communityfoundations.ca suggested recapping and clarifying specific tasks related to framing and collaboration, emphasizing that hearing details could bring clarity.Social Impact Paper and Strategy Alignment
The team discussed the purpose and scope of a paper related to philanthropy and social impact. mbaldwin@communityfoundations.ca expressed a desire for discrete experiments targeting power challenges within philanthropy, while rowanyeoman@gmail.com emphasized that the paper should convey a clear narrative but not be relied upon for strategy development. There was an agreement that the paper should inform strategy but not serve as a comprehensive strategy document.The discussion revolved around clarifying how the concept paper would inform strategic decisions. mbaldwin@communityfoundations.ca highlighted that despite being seen as an external-facing document, it was intended to guide internal project activities. This led to some confusion among team members about its intended audience and purpose.The conversation delved into differentiating between high-level and low-level strategies, with one focusing on power dynamics in philanthropy while another centered on operational methodologies for experimentation. There were concerns about blending these two aspects together and how it might affect progress.Team members sought alignment regarding their understanding of how the concept paper would contribute to their work moving forward. They acknowledged potential confusion stemming from evolving perspectives on its role from being outward-facing to informing internal projects.The group agreed to hold off making immediate decisions about refining or repurposing the concept paper at this stage, opting instead to focus on determining what is needed for future steps without trying to solve all issues related specifically to this document.The group discussed differentiating between operational deliverables and internal resources needed for strategy development based on power levers reshaping requirements. They also explored how case studies can contribute operationally while emphasizing clear articulation of strategy in documents like two-pagers or final versions.A detailed analysis was provided by Rather regarding identifying power dynamics within systems such as social impact bonds, highlighting coercion as a negative aspect requiring decentralization of evaluation processes using tools like hypersert. The discussion emphasized concrete approaches towards defining mechanisms underlying institutions' operations rather than broad-scale perspectives.Two-Pager Document Review and Feedback
rowanyeoman@gmail.com seeks clarification on the purpose of the two-pager, questioning whether it is meant to distill the power systems piece or broader concepts of the paper. farah.filsanf@gmail.com explains that it articulates the actual systems piece based on feedback received from others. The two-pager has undergone revisions and is set to be finalized for review by Manuela and subsequent discussion in team meetings.The conversation delves into confusion regarding the intent behind condensing the social impact paper into a strategic role, with rather expressing uncertainty about its content aligning with their expectations. mbaldwin@communityfoundations.ca suggests discussing this further in upcoming workstream meetings to gauge if it meets its intended objectives.farah.filsanf@gmail.com outlines that after final editing by Manuela, the two-pager should be ready for review by Thursday, with plans to discuss it at an upcoming bi-weekly call before finalizing details in next week's meeting.Operational Roadblocks and Task Management
Rather raises concerns about operational roadblocks related to experiment facilitation, gatherings coordination, and playbooks outside of core team activities. They express challenges in understanding these areas' developments and propose a coordinated effort within their team to address these issues effectively.Discussion ensues around clarifying roles within their team concerning task coordination, budget approval processes involving core teams' oversight as well as resource allocation for playbook workers.Rather suggested delegating specific roles such as event steward or playbook steward to individuals like Shanny, allowing them the authority to make decisions and collaborate effectively. The idea was to have a known role with the authority to make decisions and manage tasks within specific domains, while ensuring collaboration with the core team. rowanyeoman@gmail.com also emphasized creating a role or task that covers a particular domain without necessarily joining the group.There was discussion about not getting too involved in task management details but rather holding an overall task of coordinating playbooks at an abstract level. It was proposed that they would hold the overall task around it and delegate it out to someone like Shanny who could handle the task management around it.Rather expressed urgency in resourcing roles such as community weaver and those working on playbooks quickly, highlighting roadblocks hindering progress. The need for quick allocation of resources for these roles was emphasized due to their significance in advancing projects.There were discussions about justifying spending money on various tasks without having everything on one page being challenging. It was mentioned that clarity regarding who is doing the work and who is accountable needed improvement, suggesting potential difficulties in making budgeting decisions without clear accountability.rowanyeoman@gmail.com highlighted mapping out all ongoing project components, understanding their status, identifying urgent needs for funding or resource allocation, followed by evaluating if there will be sufficient funds left after budgeting for all these components. This approach aimed at making informed decisions based on priorities aligned with available budgets.Suggestions were made regarding creating a document outlining current tasks along with subtasks under main coordination tasks as part of progress reporting efforts. This initiative aimed at providing clarity on work being done within different domains while facilitating effective communication among team members.Role Descriptions and Responsibilities
Rather suggested finalizing role descriptions before moving forward with other discussions in order to determine what falls within each role's scope and how things should be organized accordingly.Rather mentioned that there were technical issues related to eligibility and accountabilities. It was implied that these issues might have affected the proper display of certain information.Rather stated that three responsibilities needed attention, including operational stewardship, which encompasses coordinating the operational aspects of the project.The concept of operational stewardship was discussed as a catch-all for ensuring coordination and completion of operational project tasks. rowanyeoman@gmail.com expressed agreement with this responsibility division.Rather discussed the commitment to weekly reporting into the core team, emphasizing the need for machine-assisted and easy reporting. The responsibilities listed included progress evaluation reporting, role crafting, and contributor engagement. Operational decision making was also highlighted as a responsibility with specific authority outlined in the authorities section.Rather explained that recommendations for crafting roles needed to be made to the core team due to their difficulty in dealing with such decisions. The proposal included details about operational decision making, including specific authority granted by this role.The discussion revolved around whether there was authority to create tasks for contributors and if it should be approved by the core team or handled internally. It was clarified that certain high-level resource allocation decisions remained within the prerogative of the core team.Reporting and Use of AI Tools
There were discussions about using AI tools like chat GPT for processing meeting transcripts efficiently. Rather mentioned using a paid version of chat GPT which allowed extracting details from reference documents like chat transcripts attached during meetings.The conversation touched upon improving reporting processes by creating concise reports based on meeting notes through AI tools like chat GPT or other language processing tools available in order to track metrics effectively week-to-week.It was agreed upon that taking a transcript of conversations and creating summaries based on meeting notes would be an effective method moving forward. This approach aimed at providing clarity while tracking metrics effectively week-to-week.
