Minutesüìù OS Stewards Weekly Meeting Notes üïû Started at 02:00 PM on 26 Nov, lasted 1h 56mCompensation Rates and Practices for All Gatherings ProjectA proposed rate of $40 per hour is based on current practices within the RPP project, sparking debate on whether this should be standardized or flexible.Challenges arise in explaining and implementing in-kind contributions, particularly for new team members.Differences between collaboration-scale and coordination-scale tasks are considered in terms of compensation.There is discussion about having a base rate with additional distributions for specific gatherings or extra work.Clear expectations about payment and deliverables are deemed crucial for coordination-scale tasks.Collaboration-scale tasks allow more flexibility for team-based decisions on budget allocation.Balancing fair compensation with project sustainability and budget constraints is emphasized.Knowledge Base and Playbook Development UpdateKnowledge-based documentation for creating patterns and communicating them is nearly complete, with AI tools like Cursor or ChatGPT aiding in populating pattern templates.Human refinement remains necessary despite AI assistance, and the Knowledge Garden structure is mostly empty, serving as a pre-release version.Walkthroughs and guides for using the knowledge base and creating playbooks are in development.The focus shifts from expecting others to contribute to their playbooks to creating playbooks aligned with specific contexts and needs.Creating a commons of knowledge through open-source playbooks and patterns that can be remixed and adapted by different groups is explored.Allowing organizations to structure their playbooks according to their specific use cases and audiences is recognized as important.All in for Sport Website UpdateThe website is being set up on a new CMS, with content still needing to be added, and collaboration with Lewis, a Next.js developer, is planned for fixing and updating the site.A progress payment of 500 USDC to Lewis for their work is approved, and the new site will be built on Next.js for easier future modifications and updates.Content will be in plain Markdown, allowing non-technical users to edit easily, and the updated site aims to be ready by the first session with a transformed focus away from being a funding platform.Interest in Bioregional Initiatives in OntarioHeenal expresses interest in connecting with individuals or groups involved in bioregional initiatives in Ontario, focusing on setting up a Greenpill chapter and local regenerative projects.Exploring the possibility of a bioregional coin instead of city-specific cryptocurrencies is a key interest, along with learning from experiences in Ottawa and Toronto regarding Web3 onboarding and quadratic funding implementation.Rather offers to help connect Heenal with relevant individuals in Ontario, noting the ephemeral nature of some Toronto-based organizations.Reaching out to specific individuals like Larna and exploring connections through existing chat channels is discussed.
