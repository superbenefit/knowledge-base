## Discussion Items

- hats setup for ICS

  - when setting it up, put it in your own wallet - it's quicker

  - create autonomous top hat - more flexible for future. could have Regen London and then ICS under it. 

  - https://docs.hatsprotocol.xyz/using-hats/admins-creating-issuing-and-revising-hats

  - what chain? Gnosis has more values-aligned projects and is more decentralized. Celo is more trad regen, has more grants available.

- snapshot set for ICS

  - space set up should be straightforward

  - strategy selection is more complex. can wait to do this.

  - snapshot space is tied to ENS name

  - think about whether to use our ENS or vote.commmunitysustainability.ca

  - need to decide whether we want governance space to be for ICS or Regen London

- funding

  - 

- community personas

  - a small number of archetypes when designing - segmented by "what are they coming to this for? what do they want to get out of this?"
