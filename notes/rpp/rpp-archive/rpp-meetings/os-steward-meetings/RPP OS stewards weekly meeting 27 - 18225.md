# Meeting Agenda

Weekly meeting agenda & notes for the RPP Operation & Strategy Stewards team.

## Updates

- Octant Climate Round update (heenal)

- CharmVerse (heenal)

- Women Win (heenal)

  - Nicole presented her team on them playing the fiscal sponsorship role for us - perhaps $10k US would be a good number to pitch for them to fund us.  

- CanAdapt (rowan)

- OpenCivics/TEC Playbook retro grant round

  - SB could be a matching partner in a round to fund playbook projects and contributors. We could put a couple of thousand dollars towards this (with a few other networks). This could be a retro reward for Playbook contributors across these networks. This could work to find the contributors and the projects that are being made and surface them in a way that makes them accessible.

  - We could make a criteria about people sharing the repos of structured MD files with their playbooks.

  - This could create a deliverable for the RPP.

  - This could be part of our AI exploration as part of leveraging partners as being partners in the application for funding for OTF. This would take a portion of the funding from OTF and directing it into this funding network.

  - This project is also an example of another community governed innovation network that RPP is participating in and experimenting with.

  - 

Remaining work for RPP

- Playbooks deliverables + playbooks matching funding round above

- Gatherings wrapping up

- EF + WW - Stalled -  Perhaps we can chat with Nicole and get WW's side of the value flow. We can prepare and publish the bits we have done as a wrapup for the end of the RPP v1

- ICS - getting the case study prepared

- AIFS - governance evolution - deliverable = Making a DAO

- Host a DAO's and Philanthropy salon - perhaps colab with OS in the ecosystem (or not)

- General wrapup of the project. Retrospective, documenting learning etc

## Discussion Items

- Discuss developing patterns for to move the yield fund and impact conversation forward (from GC meeting)

  - This could be framed as Web3 social finance primitives - could be additional to the community governance playbook.

  - DeFi Yield, decentralized impact mapping & measurement (how community governance relates) - start with the Highlevel and then refine into Impact Yield fund and other specific examples as needed

- OTF Funding Request (heenal)

  - Let's review potential matching partners + in-kind contributions

    - Equality Fund - $10k CAD (expected March/April 2025)

    - Women Win - $10k USD (tbc Q2 2025)

    - ICS - $5k CAD (tbc)

    - SuperBenefit - $100k in-kind

    - Some of these are hypothetical

      - GAIA AI - discussing 1m token tokenswap ($10k value)

      - Commons Economy Roadmap (pending funding approval) - >10k Euro

      - Token Engineering Commons - $10k USD to playbooks project knowledge commons

      - AIFS IOC potential....

- Planning RPP Gatherings (heenal)

- Future collaboration with AIFS (heenal)

- Still waiting on Sue? - Can we jam with WW on their end of EF/WW experiment?

- [BioFi pattern](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/artifacts/patterns/biofi.md) from Exeunt (rather)

Minutesüìù OS Stewards Weekly Meeting Notes üïû Started at 02:01 PM on 18 Feb, lasted 2h 38mUpdate on Octant Comment RoundOctant reached out for more information on the application, indicating active review.They requested clarification on a broken link in the application that was linked to something in Chase that wasn't public.This demonstrates Octant's engagement with the application details.Heenal plans to clean up the link and provide the requested information.Issues with Charmverse SoftwareThe team experienced problems with Charmverse, including lost work and connectivity issues.The software seems to have a browser-first, client-first approach which can lead to conflicts with other browser resources and plugins.This results in a poor user experience, especially for regular users with multiple tabs and sessions open.The optimal solution would be a local client or a web application with a backend server handling things in real-time, similar to Notion.However, Charmverse appears to have cloned Notion's front-end without implementing a robust back-end, leading to persistent issues.Potential Collaboration with Token Engineering Commons (TEC)Rather discussed a potential collaboration with Token Engineering Commons (TEC) for a playbooks retro round.TEC is putting effort into making their knowledge more accessible, especially to local communities for practical complementary economics.The plan is to organize a grant round by June, coinciding with the application date for GG 25 or 26.The collaboration aims to reward people who have been working on playbooks, make the work sustainable, and encourage continued efforts.The grant round would require open-source submissions, facilitating knowledge sharing across the community.Update on Covalent Ring Group and EARTHNET ProjectRowan provided an update on the Covalent Ring group, which includes several projects centered around a product called EARTHNET.The group is pitching to the Canadian government for funding to facilitate a network on the Covalent Ring platform focused on climate resilience.There is potential for partnership with Super Benefit, leveraging the DAO primitives and work on small, purpose-aligned networks of autonomous teams.The project presents an opportunity to apply learnings from RPP and the primitives and playbooks being created.Discussion on Developing Patterns for Yield Fund and Impact ConversationThe team discussed developing patterns to move forward the yield fund and impact conversation from the GC meeting.Rather suggested building out patterns that could be used in future conversations with funders based on concrete examples rather than speculation.The plan is to include these patterns in the community governance playbook under a section on Web3 social finance vehicles.This approach would allow for presenting a solution space to potential stakeholders, covering various pieces like DAFFs, null fund, and other primitives.OTF Fund Request UpdateHeenal plans to update Tracy at OTF about potential matching funds and partnerships, including Equality Fund, Women Win, ICS, and Super Benefit's in-kind contributions.The team discussed how to present these collaborations and potential funding sources to OTF, emphasizing the leverage of OTF's funding to raise additional project-based funding.They also considered how to frame the community-governed innovation network aspect of their work to align with OTF's interests and requirements.Planning for RPP Gatherings and Future Collaboration with All for SportThe team discussed plans for upcoming RPP gatherings, including a final stakeholder meeting to serve as a retrospective wrap-up of the current cycle.They also considered future collaboration with All for Sport, potentially involving another series of gatherings if funding is secured.The focus is on activating the All for Sport Discord channel to create conditions for organic gathering opportunities arising from community activity.BioFi Pattern Review and FeedbackThe team reviewed the BIOF (Bioregional) pattern created by Zunt.Feedback included suggestions for clarifying terminology, adding examples of existing bioregional organizations, and including a section on bioregional hubs.The team also discussed the need to identify necessary content and remove unnecessary links to improve user experience.They plan to make the pattern more concise and information-dense, following the conventions of Web3 playbooks.
