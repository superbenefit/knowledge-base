# Meeting Agenda

Weekly meeting agenda & notes for the RPP Operation & Strategy Stewards team.

## Discussion Items

- Work on IFP - With the full RPP/SB crew

  - https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/infinite-front-porch-concept-note-8671287658579254

  - Understanding the project

  - Strategy 

    - What are the outcomes, who is impacted by this? We need to be able to answer this for philanthropic funders 

    - Funders are thinking about AI in a very different way

    - Perhaps we can think about how to pitch this to funders - by creating some usecases of a Phase 2 version of the IFP. This can show them the end value to the communities that will use it. We could find examples where sharing data can be dangerous and play into the AI safety theme that funders are working on. 

    - One approach would be to leverage institutional funding to gain on chain funding demonstrating how this decentralized organizing can be done well. 

- Possible funders 

  - Mike Jansen - from the crypto AI space

  - Menzies Foundation 

  - Sue - from EF

  - Alex Tviet 

  - Most funders in Canada are interested in skills building and safety and will be unlikely to fund IFP

  - What global programs might be accessible to the project. 

  - Perhaps we focus on doing an octant grant round and really focus on meming this into funding 

- 

- Resolve expenses for Windfall Protocol and transfer remainder to SB to pay for Marshal Island set up

# Summary

- The need to understand the current narrative of the Infinite Front Porch concept and its execution strategy was emphasized, particularly the importance of stakeholder involvement in roles and funding.

- Clarification was sought and provided on the term 'Infinite Front Porch' and its origin, acknowledging the possibility of changing it if problematic.

- The group discussed the potential for collaboration with organizations like Block Science and the necessity of explaining the project in terms that various stakeholders can understand.

- The concept of data sovereignty and the importance of community ownership of data were highlighted, emphasizing the need to build trust and understanding among communities.

- The importance of thinking about the narrative for phase two of the project, beyond the current prototype phase, and the need to be clear about the fundamental drivers of the project were emphasized.

- Potential funding strategies were discussed, including targeting organizations familiar with Web3 technology and focusing on community-based outcomes to attract funders.

- The challenge of finding funding for the project due to the current focus on safety and skills in the AI sector was acknowledged, and the idea of exploring alternative funding sources like Web3 funding was raised.

- The concept of framing the project around AI safety and its potential to make communities more safe was proposed as a way to attract funding.

- The idea of convening a group of interested parties to discuss the project and potentially secure funding was proposed, with the aim of building trust and understanding among potential funders.

Minutesüìù Infinite Front Porch & SB Funding Strategy Notes üïû Started at 2:15PM on 06 May, lasted 1h 39mUnderstanding the Infinite Front Porch ProjectRowan outlined the Infinite Front Porch project, which involves community knowledge mobilization, LLM agent design, and the swarming of those agents to create a broader knowledge commons.The project aims to retain community ownership of data and allow communities to benefit from their data as it becomes more sophisticated.The project structure includes a stakeholder group, an operational structure, and a funding strategy.Super Benefit will play the role of an active project partner and ecosystem within which the project will operate.The goal is to find funding partners to support the project, either through a single large grant or a more distributed strategy involving opt-in grants or Web3 funding mechanisms.Clarification on the Infinite Front Porch Name and ConceptRowan explained that the term 'Infinite Front Porch' was coined internally and is not a term of art in the crypto space.The concept refers to the idea of making information and AI agents publicly accessible as a common good, rather than hiding them away.The name and concept may be changed if problematic or if a better alternative is found.Use Cases and Benefits of the Infinite Front PorchRowan provided an example of how the Infinite Front Porch could be used to set up a community organization, with access to structured data and tools to navigate the process.The project aims to create a knowledge commons that protects data sovereignty and helps communities leverage the value of their data.The goal is to enable communities to own and control their data, address place-based problems, and benefit from the information they publish.Funding Strategy and Potential FundersThe group discussed the need to find funding partners for the Infinite Front Porch project, either through a single large grant or a more distributed strategy.Potential funders may include organizations interested in facilitating knowledge stewardship around AI for the communities they invest in.The group considered the possibility of partnering with organizations like Block Science for Phase Two of the project to design a more scalable implementation.The group also discussed the challenge of explaining the project to funders and the importance of translating different sets of jargon and understanding.Michelle mentioned the focus on skills building and safety in the current AI funding landscape in Canada and the potential for funding from organizations like Mike Janssen's foundation.The group considered the possibility of using Web3 funding organizations and on-chain funding as a best-case scenario.The group discussed the idea of convening a group of interested parties to test the concept and gather feedback, potentially leading to funding opportunities.Government Funding and IncorporationFilsan mentioned the possibility of incorporating to access government funding, given the Canadian government's focus on AI and AI literacy.Michelle discussed the legal structure and potential partners like Sarah Wolf and Tasha, who could bring indigenous perspectives and equity to the project.The group considered the possibility of using some of the Women Win money to fund initial scoping out and coordination efforts.Amount of Funding NeededRowan estimated that having half a million dollars would be amazing for the project, allowing for extensive coordination and implementation efforts.However, even with $10,000, the group could still use it to coordinate the groups and bring some coherence to the project.The group discussed the importance of translating the concept in a way that is clear and accessible to different audiences and testing it with potential funders.Next Steps and Potential CollaboratorsThe group discussed reaching out to Mike Jensen and the Menzies Foundation as potential collaborators and funders.They also considered contacting Liz and exploring the possibility of involving Sue in the project.The group planned to identify other potential interested parties and organizations to engage in conversations about the project.
