# Meeting Agenda

Weekly meeting agenda & notes for the RPP Operation & Strategy Stewards team.

## Updates

- Equality Fund $ (heenal)

- Spencer has developed a JSON LD schema that lists services that orgs have available. We can use this to create a directory of available services for each knowledge garden. Then an LLM can fetch all of the services available across the knowledge commons. This can help with coordination across all of the networks we are connected to. Creating a bit of a services marketplace. 

  - We will need to clarify what we are offering. E.g discovery work - what work, in what context, for whom etc

## Discussion Items

- Review IFP diagram (rowan)

- Review and collab on SuperBenefit diagram (rowan)

- Discussion topics from yesterday's GC meeting

  - Discuss adding Filsan to the GC or GC chat (from RPP meeting) (rowan)

  - Discuss the **next steps for the yield fund project idea** (from RPP meeting) 

  - Discuss the SETSI AI conversation 

  - Legal entity plan outline:

# Summary

- The team discussed the potential of using AI tools to augment existing systems, particularly for non-developers, and the benefits of linking tools together rather than stacking them in dependency trees.

- The team explored the idea of creating a directory of services provided by each organization using a JSON-LD schema, which could be accessed by language models to help users navigate and find the right services.

- The team discussed the challenges of traditional banking systems and the need for better alternatives, particularly in the context of transferring funds and dealing with non-compete agreements.

- The team considered the idea of using a three horizons model to represent the different stages of the Infinite Front Porch project, with the knowledge commons, agents, and swarms as the three horizons.

- The team discussed the importance of having a clear pitch for the Infinite Front Porch project and the need to articulate the different stages and components of the project to potential funders and partners.

- The team explored the idea of using a decentralized operating structure for the project, with a stakeholder structure and an operating structure that would deliver on the project's goals.

- The team discussed the potential of using LLMs to deliver answers to abstract questions with real intelligence by bridging different perspectives and finding patterns in between them. {{102:39}}

- The team considered the idea of using a permissionless network to facilitate the formation of projects and the importance of having a clear goalpost for the conversation stage. {{114:36}}

- The team discussed the potential of using blockchain technology to onboard more sports for social good organizations and the opportunity for Chile's to expand into the sports for good community. {{130:20}}

Minutesüìù OS Stewards Weekly Meeting Notes üïû Started at 2:00PM on 15 Apr, lasted 1h 41mVIBE Coding and Knowledge ManagementRather and Heenal discussed a VIBE coding learning session led by Spencer, who used knowledge management principles to structure his workflow.They explored how VIBE coding can be used by non-developers to augment systems and create applications.The conversation touched on the potential of using AI tools to help with software development and the challenges of integrating AI with existing systems.Prompts and Customization in AI ToolsHeenal shared their experience of transitioning from using prompts in Obsidian to using them in the Claude Desktop setup.The group discussed the benefits of storing preferences and instructions at both the account and project levels in AI tools.They explored the idea of having a central repository for prompts and how this could facilitate collaboration and iteration among team members.Modular Systems and LLMsRowan and Rather discussed the concept of modular systems driven by LLMs, allowing for more flexible and composable solutions.They highlighted the advantages of using LLMs as an interface to link tools together, rather than stacking them in dependency trees.The conversation touched on the potential of LLMs to expand the possibility space for users, allowing them to combine discrete functionalities without complex dependencies.Non-Compete AgreementsHeenal shared their frustration with non-compete agreements, particularly in relation to a potential co-working space project.Rather expressed their disdain for non-compete agreements, citing issues with poorly written clauses and the negative impact on employee mobility.The group discussed the importance of carefully reviewing legal agreements and the need for better regulation of non-compete clauses.Equality Fund UpdateHeenal provided an update on the Equality Fund, mentioning issues with transferring funds to Newton and the lack of response from customer service.Rather suggested exploring alternative options for bank accounts, such as opening an account with a Marshall Islands LLC.The group discussed the need for better systems and alternatives to traditional banks for financial transactions.Service Offerings and Knowledge CommonsRather proposed the idea of creating a directory of services offered by organizations within the knowledge commons ecosystem.They discussed the potential benefits of having a structured marketplace for services, facilitated by LLMs, to ease coordination and collaboration.The group explored the concept of clarifying and listing their own service offerings to participate in the system and enhance collaboration within the network.Meeting Archiving and Knowledge ManagementRather mentioned their work on creating a meeting archive and generating meeting reports using AI tools.Heenal expressed interest in the potential of AI tools for collaborative work, particularly in Obsidian and other platforms.The group discussed the challenges and opportunities of integrating AI tools with existing knowledge management systems to improve efficiency and collaboration.Infinite Front Porch ProjectRowan presented diagrams and discussed the structure and phases of the Infinite Front Porch project.The group explored the idea of a three-horizons model to represent the project's progression and the dependencies between different components.They discussed the pitch for the project, the importance of clarifying service offerings, and the potential for funding and collaboration with partners.Labor DAO and Web3 Contributor ExperienceRather discussed the research focus of Labor DAO on the Web3 contributor experience and traditional labor organizing.They highlighted the potential of combining empirical research with inner subjectivity to create a robust resource for understanding the human experience in Web3 systems.The group explored the role of agents in mobilizing community knowledge and bridging the gap between traditional and Web3 labor practices.Conversation and Formation Stages in Project DevelopmentThe group discussed the importance of having clear goalposts and deliverables for different stages of project development.They explored the concept of a permissionless network and the challenges of moving from conversation to formation stages in project formation.The group emphasized the need for clear documentation and communication to facilitate the transition from conversation to actionable project development.Experiment Deliverables and Knowledge BaseRather mentioned their work on templatizing experiment deliverables to establish clear goalposts for experiments.Heenal shared positive results from working with the Knowledge Garden and Claude, highlighting the benefits of using local LLM interfaces.The group discussed the potential of browser automation plugins and tools like sequential thinking and browser automation for enhancing productivity and efficiency.
