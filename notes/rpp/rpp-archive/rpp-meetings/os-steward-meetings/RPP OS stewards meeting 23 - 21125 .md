# Summary

- The group discussed presenting the idea of an impact yield lending pool to Boen, a potential funder, in an upcoming meeting.

- They considered the size of the fund, with suggestions ranging from $500,000 to $5 million as a target.

- The discussion focused on how to describe the impact and allocation of the excess yield from the lending pool.

- Examples of potential impact areas included experiments like the Equality Fund CRM replacement, ICS, and All in for Sport.

- The group explored ways to maintain separation between the funders and the community allocation of funds.

- They discussed the need for legal structuring, potentially involving offshore entities, to facilitate the lending pool.

- The group considered including slides or a presentation for the Boen meeting to outline the concept and examples.

- The playbooks channel was set up, and contributors were invited to work on the community governance playbook outline.

- A design jam session was proposed to define the content outline for the community governance playbook.

Minutesüìù OS Stewards Weekly Meeting Notes üïû Started at 02:01 PM on 21 Jan, lasted 2h 18mMeeting Preparation for Potential FunderThe Reimagining Power Project (RPP) team, including Rowan, Rather, Heenal, Michelle, Filsan, Lewwwk (Michael), and Naan, prepared for an upcoming meeting with Boen, a potential funder, scheduled for Thursday.Some team members had to join late or leave early due to other commitments.Impact Yield Lending Pool ProposalMichael (Lewwwk) presented a proposal for an impact yield lending pool that involves taking advantage of crypto-native lending of USDC to generate higher yields with a low risk profile.Endowments would put funds into this pool, receiving a base yield equivalent to Treasury yields, while excess yields would be directed towards community allocation and impact projects.This approach is highly scalable and allows for real-time, liquid deployment of funds, with the team discussing targeting an initial pool size of 3-5 million dollars.They debated whether to ask Boen for investment capital or support for setup costs.Presentation Strategy for Boann MeetingThe team discussed how to present the impact yield lending pool idea to Boen, agreeing to focus on educating funders about decentralized finance.Emphasis will be placed on the flexibility and scalability of the model, highlighting how excess yields can be directed to impactful projects without requiring funders to micromanage allocation.Vision for Super Benefit NetworkRowan outlined a vision for Super Benefit as a convening network that incubates and supports multiple collaborative projects, including existing ones like RPP and Windfall, and potential new ones like the impact yield fund.The network would leverage playbooks, stakeholder governance models, and other tools developed through RPP, positioning Super Benefit as an ecosystem approach to impact by incubating and funding impactful Web3 projects.Describing Work to BoenThe team debated how to describe their work to Boen, agreeing to balance concrete examples of current projects with broader themes they are exploring.Potential examples include the Equality Fund collaboration, ICS, All In For Sport, and Windfall, along with areas like AI, quadratic funding, and bioregional finance.Accommodating Non-Institutionalized ParticipantsRather raised concerns about accommodating non-institutionalized participants and communities that may need to operate outside traditional legal frameworks.Potential solutions discussed included using permissionless protocols for fund distribution, implementing privacy-preserving measures when onboarding and distributing funds, and leveraging partnerships like Newton for crypto on-ramping with enhanced privacy.Playbooks Channel UpdateRather provided an update on the Playbooks channel and upcoming work, noting interest from multiple groups, including Biomimmune and some developers.There is a need to establish a content outline for the community governance playbook, with plans to schedule a design jam to co-create the playbook structure with contributors.DAO Cell Playbook OutlineRowan mentioned working on a DAO Cell playbook outline based on the community governance framework.Preparation for Boen MeetingPreparations for the Boen meeting include Rowan creating a simple slide deck outlining key points and examples, Michael leading the explanation of the impact yield mechanism, and finalizing messaging around impact direction and examples.Design Jam SchedulingA design jam for playbook development is scheduled for Thursday's core team meeting.Potential Contributions and Follow-UpsHeenal has a call with Sue on Friday about potential RPP contribution, with Rather possibly joining.Follow-up actions include contacting Women Win and the Equality Fund about potential crypto implementation for fund distribution.
