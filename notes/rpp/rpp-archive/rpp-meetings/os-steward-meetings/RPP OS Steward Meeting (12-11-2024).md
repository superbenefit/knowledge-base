# Summary

- The group discussed the scope and next steps for the Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) project, which aims to create a system of community and operational governance.

- They talked about conducting research on existing governance models, particularly in the bio-regional and municipal spaces, to inform the design of ICS's governance framework.

- The idea of hosting community sessions to gather input and gauge interest in the ICS project was proposed.

- The group discussed the need to define the infrastructure requirements for ICS, such as setting up governance contracts and basic tooling.

- They explored the possibility of collaborating with the Open Protocol Research Guild for institutional research related to the ICS project.

- The group discussed the progress on the Playbooks project, including the need to define the Playbook Steward role and create a Playbook Design Template.

- They talked about the pattern for crypto-based funds disbursement, which needs to be developed for the Equality Fund conversation.

- The group discussed the potential for ICS to become a Green Pill Network chapter and leverage their playbook templates and assets.

Minutesüìù OS Stewards Weekly Meeting Notes üïû Started at 01:59 PM on 12 Nov, lasted 1h 49mCommunity and Operational Governance DevelopmentThe Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) is developing a system of community and operational governance to increase involvement in the organization's operations and goal-setting.The aim is to create cells for different programs or functions within the organization, giving people ownership of various areas.This includes establishing Web3 Rails to engage with Web3 projects, onboard people into Web3, and support the local Web3 ecosystem while tapping into the global network.The project involves developing a governance model framework, setting up governance contracts and basic tooling, and onboarding community members to Web3.Discovery Report and Value Flow CompassHeenal will complete a discovery report using a provided template to clarify ideas and identify gaps requiring further research.The team will work through a 'value flow compass' template to further identify research needs.Rather will set up infrastructure for ICS, making it effectively a Web3 local node.The team plans to host two or three community sessions to engage locals in the process.They will explore becoming a Green Pill chapter, which could provide resources like playbook templates and connect ICS to a broader network.Research into Bioregional Spaces and Municipal ExperimentsThe team discussed conducting research into bioregional spaces and municipal experiments.Rather mentioned that the Open Protocol Research Guild in Portland might be a good resource for institutional research related to unusual civic experiments.The team plans to be selective and specific about research to keep it manageable.They will look into examples from the UN's work with crypto and consider referencing related patterns such as onramping fiat to crypto, seed phrase management, and security considerations.Creation of PlaybooksThe team is working on creating playbooks, with initial focus on a Dao cell playbook and a community governance playbook.They are developing a 'playbook on how to make a playbook' as part of their knowledge products.Rather will create an object for playbooks in their knowledge base and start working on a playbook design template.They discussed the need for graphical assets and templates for creating PDFs, considering options like using Figma templates similar to those used by Green Pill.Crypto-Based Funds Disbursement PatternRather will work on developing a pattern for crypto-based funds disbursement for the Equality Fund.This will involve creating use case examples and describing implementations to start a conversation with Sue from the Equality Fund.The pattern will reference related patterns such as custody options and self-custody methods.Presentation Preparation and Upcoming EventHeenal and Filsan were preparing for a presentation later that day.The team also discussed an upcoming event on December 7th, which will be a full-day market, artist, and music event.They considered using this event to introduce the ICS project to the community, possibly issuing POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol tokens) to attendees.Compensation and Legal StructureThe team discussed the importance of ensuring that team members are compensated for their time spent on the ICS project, as it is part of the work covered by the OTF (Open Technology Fund) grant.They also touched on the legal structure of ICS and Reimagine, noting that while they operate using cooperative principles, they are structured as a business and a nonprofit respectively, due to the restrictions of cooperative legal structures in their jurisdiction.
