# Meeting Agenda

Weekly meeting agenda & notes for the RPP Operation & Strategy Stewards team.

## Updates

- women win (heenal)

  - Heenal to set up a call with Nicole to discuss WW experiment going forward 

- funding (heenal)

- deliverables

- notes on service offering 

  - WW can become a spun out project - an example of SB service offereing

  - Idea - we set up a 5k and 10k offering - to be able to catch discretionary spending amounts from orgs... rather than a full engagement from an org. 

  - This can focus on engaging individuals from orgs to come and experiment without needing to bring their whole org in board. 

## Discussion Items

- Put together a plan for delivery of final RPP outputs 

  - Heenal's conversation with Michelle

  - It is more about how we want to capture our work than about what OTF want. 

  - What do we want to tell people about the RPP

1. The knowledge garden - ecosystem of knowledge gardens 

      - Perhaps fund Spencer + Exeunt to put together a knowledge garden artifact and templates etc to that we can publish. Perhaps in the form of a book.   

      - We could ask GreenPill to publish it 

      - These artifacts about knowledge gardens can be added to our own knowledge garden to explain what it is. 

      - Tell the story of community knowledge/data in the AI age. 

      - 

1. Evolution of SB into a community governed innovation network - this is part recap/review of RPP as a project and part evolution of superbenefit. 


1. Tell the story of the emergent nature of decentralized organizing and how the real insights emerged once we started executing on it. 


1. Experiments 

      - AIFS

      - WW-EF 

      - ICS

1. Other narratives 


1. Experiments lead to new opportunities - case study - WW coming in as part of the EF experiments, and this evolving into it's own collaboration and ongoing research opportunity - example of the power of decentralized organizing... 


1. Another example is IFP emerging out of the knowledge garden project in collaboration with other partners and in response to emerging technology


1. Core premise - coordination is hard - but this kind of work can help slow moving orgs to engage with a small fast moving team context to help them engage with a speed of change that they could otherwise never keep up with. We need this if these orgs are going to have any chance of adapting to change

- ICS dao state?

  - ICS local activation & gitcoin funding - Capstone deliverable?

  - Working on hats tree, etc

- SB DAO state, operating agreement, etc

$10,000 funding.Service Offerings and PricingRathermercurial suggested offering services at different tiers to match discretionary spending limits, such as $5,000 or $10,000.The quality fund would focus on discovery and scoping, while Women Win would involve actual implementation of experiments.These services would be easier to sell compared to smaller engagements.Funding and Business IssuesHeenal updated on the funding situation, mentioning a lack of communication from Newton.Heenal also discussed progress with Shakepay and the KYC process.Meeting Coordination and UpdatesHeenal planned to set up a call with Nicole regarding the $10,000 sponsorship.Rowan and Rathermercurial expressed interest in joining the call, with consideration for time zone differences.Metrics and DeliverablesHeenal and Rowan reviewed metrics and deliverables, including the number of convenings, participants, and types of new infrastructure developed.They discussed the importance of documenting the funding of projects and the narrative style deliverables.Knowledge Products and ArtifactsHeenal and Rowan discussed the inclusion of various knowledge products and artifacts, such as patterns, guides, and interviews.They considered the relevance and value of including these items in their deliverables.Plan for Core Knowledge ProductsRowan suggested creating a plan for core knowledge products, including playbooks and the knowledge base.They aimed to include these in metrics and other deliverables.Value and Reporting of DeliverablesHeenal and Rowan discussed the value and reporting of deliverables, considering what would be sufficient and valuable for stakeholders.They emphasized the importance of documenting and reporting for posterity and the near to medium term.Knowledge Gardens and CommonsRathermercurial proposed the creation of detailed write-ups on Knowledge Gardens and the Knowledge Commons.They discussed the potential of publishing these as books or PDFs and the
