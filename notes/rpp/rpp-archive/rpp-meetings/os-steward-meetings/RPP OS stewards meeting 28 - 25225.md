Minutesüìù OS Stewards Weekly Meeting Notes üïû Started at 2:04PM on 25 Feb, lasted 1h 58mTreasury Update and Budget PlanningThe group discussed the current state of the treasury, which has about $10,000 remaining, split roughly evenly between Ether and USDC.They noted that the operational safe is nearly empty.The team began working on a budget plan for the remaining funds, trying to allocate resources to various ongoing projects and initiatives.They discussed the challenges of budgeting accurately, given the fluid nature of their work and the difficulty in estimating time commitments for different tasks.The group debated different approaches to budgeting, including allocating specific amounts to each project versus setting aside funds for steward compensation and letting the work fall under that umbrella.They acknowledged the need to be flexible and potentially adjust their plans as they progress, while also trying to avoid overcommitting themselves to unpaid work.Playbook Development and FundingThe team discussed the ongoing development of their playbooks, which is a significant focus of their current work.They noted that there is $4,000 already allocated for external contributors to the playbooks, which is separate from the $10,000 in the treasury.Rather estimated that an additional $3,500 to $4,000 might be needed for publication needs, including editing and ensuring the playbooks are published effectively.The group recognized that the playbooks would likely consume a significant portion of their remaining budget and time, but also saw it as a crucial deliverable for their project.They discussed the need to balance the depth and breadth of the playbooks with their available resources, potentially scaling back in some areas if necessary.Ongoing Projects and ExperimentsThe team reviewed several ongoing projects and experiments, including ICS (Integrity Certification System), Equality Fund Experiment, All In For Sport, and Final Gathering.For ICS, they allocated $500 for potential tools or external contributions, with the understanding that most of the work would be done by the stewards.For the Equality Fund Experiment, $1,000 was budgeted for this initiative, though they acknowledged this was a rough estimate and the actual work might require more or less resources.Regarding All In For Sport, the team discussed the need to wrap up this project, including implementing a governance design.They debated whether to allocate specific funds for this or consider it part of the stewards' general responsibilities.For the Final Gathering, the group mentioned the need to organize a final gathering or salon, likely as a virtual event to present their outputs and gather stakeholders to discuss their experiences.Steward Compensation and WorkloadA significant portion of the discussion revolved around how to compensate the stewards for their ongoing work across various projects.They estimated that if stewards were paid $200 per week for both OS (Operating System) and playbook steward roles, it would cost about $8,000 over eight weeks.The team grappled with how to balance this compensation with the need to allocate funds to specific projects and external contributors.They acknowledged that some work might need to be done without compensation if the budget runs short, recognizing this as part of the risk of stewardship.Upcoming Deadlines and ReportingThe group mentioned several upcoming deadlines and tasks, including final reporting for the OTF grant, wrapping up the gatherings program, and deciding on the allocation or return of any potential surplus from the gatherings program.The final reporting for the OTF grant would release the last $10,000 CAD of funding.Wrapping up the gatherings program involved processing final contributions and coordinating reports.Potential surplus from the gatherings program required decisions on allocation or return.ETH Denver and Crypto Market DiscussionsHeenal shared updates from their attendance at ETH Denver, mentioning various meetings and side events they had participated in.The group briefly discussed the current state of the crypto market, including institutional involvement in Bitcoin and recent hacks or exploits in the space.They touched on regulatory concerns, particularly around stablecoins and the potential for regulatory capture in the industry.
