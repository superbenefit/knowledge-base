- Heenal call with Liam Buckley - discussed ideas for 2025 to explore for London. Heenal will put ideas into a doc to work towards some experiments. Possibility of doing a presentation for a local event. Consensus is going to be in Toronto in May. 

- Had a call w/ Finn @ null fund; Will write up a pattern (rather)

  - If we wanted to do an experiment with this we would be looking for a funder wanting to put in a 7 figure investment. Before this we would want to develop a pattern around this kind of model and then think about something like Null fund as a primitive that we could develop to implement an experiment.

  - We will need to communicate some of this for the community governance playbook so this will likely fall under this design 

- Playbooks cell set up - 

## Discussion Items

- Octant grant for gatherings (heenal)

  - "Re: events, yeah I think that could be of interest to the Octant team. If you have any more information about the Gatherings series, I can share it with them. I can also talk to Patricia and Ben at OpenCivics if some of the logistics depend on them."

- Plan for Playbooks: Which deliverables to prioritize and how to budget?

Minutesüìù OS Stewards Weekly Meeting Notes üïû Started at 02:04 PM on 17 Dec, lasted 1h 59mDevelopment of Playbooks and Task ManagementThe team is working on developing playbooks and managing related tasks, with a parent task called 'Playbooks RPP' that introduces the purpose and holds a progress tracking task board.An operational plan exists where all planning happens, featuring a timeline board with dates for different tasks.Creation of Structural Guidelines and TemplatesThere was a discussion about swapping out a task to create playbook structural guidelines and templates with Rather's version, which was completed and set as a December 24th deliverable.Dow Primitives Documentation and Lexicon EntriesThe team is completing Dow primitives documentation in the knowledge base, including populating lexicon entries as they work on documents.Clarifying things in the lexicon will be a large portion of the work.Rather suggested that if something should be in the lexicon, it should be put there entirely to avoid maintaining multiple versions.For items that play dual roles (e.g., as a pattern and a lexicon entry), Rather recommended putting them in the tags directory with appropriate metadata and aliases.Document Management ProcessThe process of moving completed documents from working docs to the tags directory was discussed, adding necessary metadata like aliases.Shift in Contributor Task ManagementWith many contributors now involved, there is a need to shift from doling out individual tasks to having contributors divvy up work among themselves.A to-do list on the board is needed to track progress.Current Contributor TasksCurrent contributor tasks include importing research from the Biomunni project into their knowledge base, working on a BIOF pattern by Zunt, and potential improvements to their Quartz system by Spencer.Facilitating and coordinating these efforts, especially for the Biomunni research import, is necessary.Improvements to Quartz SystemSpencer offered to make improvements to the Quartz system to enhance visual consistency across platforms.This approach is seen as a way to sidestep issues with limited core team involvement in design decisions.Consistent PDF Layout TemplatePlans are in place to create a consistent PDF layout template for all documents.Consolidating and clarifying design-related tasks in the task management system is recognized as necessary.Content Planning for PlaybooksContent planning for the actual playbooks includes collecting requirements, determining what to include, and planning to populate the template.This work will be done under specific tasks for each playbook, such as 'DAOs playbook' and 'community governance playbook.'Rather volunteered to outline the template and high-level instructions in the practice sections of these tasks as a starting point.This process involves brainstorming, sense-making, and some research.Visuals and Templates ExpansionCreating a set of visuals and templates, potentially expanding from just playbook assets to designs for the entire Quartz system, was discussed.A conversation with Spencer to sketch out the plan and set a budget for this task is planned.Windfall Protocol Project InvolvementWork on the Windfall Protocol is still ongoing, contrary to previous understanding.Rather was invited to join a stakeholder group for the project and plans to request an invite for Rowan as well.Super Benefit may play a role as a community facilitator in this project.Challenges in Professional Networking GroupsChallenges of participating in professional networking groups when not being paid for that time were briefly discussed, contrasting with those whose job it is to engage in such activities.Economic Policy Engine DevelopmentOngoing development of the economic policy engine for the Windfall Protocol by Luke and their team, including collaboration with the inverter network, was touched upon.
