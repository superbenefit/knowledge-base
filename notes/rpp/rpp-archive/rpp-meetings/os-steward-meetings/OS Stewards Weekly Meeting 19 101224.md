## Discussion Items


- Review feedback from Sue and plan next steps for EF project (rowan)

  - we have the fundamentals of the private payments pattern. need to crunch the feedback from sue and plan next steps.

  - Based on Sue's thoughts and advice from the EF we have narrowed down to an implementation approach and now we need a plan to actually do it

  - We need a conversation with the EF to do this but in advance we need to map out a few more patterns and primitives 

    - Privacy Payments

    - Lexicon (definitions)

    - Patterns

      - Wallets

      - Defi

    - Primitives

      - [RailGun](https://www.railgun.org/) - defi protocol

      - Burner wallets (practice)

      - DeFi OpSec - practice

      - Treasury mgmt

  - The project planning should be pretty easy, research etc will be a chunk though. 

  - Asked Sue if she has more info about shortlisted org who is using crypto - what chains, tools, etc

  - 'Treat every situation as if it's a high risk situation' is a good path for us to follow

- AIFS governance plan / progression? (rather)

  - it would be good if governance changes could keep pace with gatherings. first need to find out what people want

  - showcase hats in sessions

  - hypercerts - can be for anything

- Plan for generating community finance patterns for boann, etc (rather)

- **_Longer Items:_**

  - Cell for playbook contributors (rather)

    - Set up playbooks project management (rowan)

    - Create a collaborative cel to manage the playbook contributors 

    - Who 

      - Jose (+ Vanessa) 

      - Playbook contributors 

      - Co-governors/collaborators 

      - Spencer 

      - Rather

      - Rowan

    - Spin it down when we are done working on playbooks 

    - Based on the State pattern and Nucleus Primitive we use

    - Design Cell State (based on opencivics)

    - Create a proposal to the RPP core team

      - Then turn into a PDF and sign it from the RPP core team and Cell core team

      - Use a moloch with the RPP being the funder (with rage quit rights) and the people in the Cell being stakeholders

Sue - example - FINI womens fund in south america. Funds get lost in banking fees. They have a very political orientation. They also do on-granting internationally and we assume that this is expensive for them. 

- EF makes an agreement with them prior to granting them money - this means that we need to ensure that EF has sight over the systems being used. We could use cryptographic shielding of the transaction.

- Sue - doing something new, we need to do something to a higher standard - so not co-mingling funds is probably the right idea

- Re liquidity - it is not uncomon to be granting $1m ish funds. Much of this is ongranting - for most about 70% of funds in ongranted. They grant each year. With 3 years being standard. There are checkpoints once a year where they need to prove use of funds. $300k CAD is a large transaction. 

- No idea on whether to use stablecoins. 

- QUESTION - are we going to map the whole process through to on-granting. This would be highly valuable. 

- They are going to look in their portfolio and see if there are orgs that use crypto already. The best usecases will be those who are already using crypto or have knowledge and those for whom moving money is difficult and expensive.  Or places where it is dangerous to move money - e.g where it illegal to be LGBGT etc

- There is a womans fund who is focused on digital - they would be savvy 

- There are places where it is very difficult to move funds 

- There is a shortlisted org that might be a good candidate

- Housekeeping - 

  - Payments for social impact paper translation
