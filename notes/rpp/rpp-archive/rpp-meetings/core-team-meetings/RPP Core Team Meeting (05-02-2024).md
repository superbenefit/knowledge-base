## Progress Review

**Last Week's Action Items**

Review last week's action items and update status:

- [x] Filsan to populate RPP stakeholder agenda

Still needed: Checkin questions

- [x] Michelle to connect with Sue about participatory grant making share at RPP stakeholder agenda

- [x] rather to check in on discord about co-budgeting and any concerns

# Agenda

Discuss shorter agenda items:

- Progress and format for social impact paper - MB has got started and thinking long narrative might not be right approach. What if more visuals, bulleted lists, pull out quotes (MB)

  - Filsan started risk aversion, difficulties tracking impact measurement, started decolonization

  - still to get to web3 share 

  - rather to share paper around neocolonialism and philanthropy and visuals 

- web3 and finance innovation paper (Menzies Foundation and Criterion Institute) podcast launch shifted by a few weeks to take the time to prep. Looking for examples of community finance and web3 to share 

 https://menziesfoundation.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Web3-Solutions-for-Social-Change_Dec2023.pdf 

  - the communities who want that kind of innovation but they don't want folks to design it for them, co-designing as better framing,

  - Check out Open Civics - rather will give list 

- Vote to approve [workstream budgets](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/rpp-phase-1-budget-usdc-5982002752818469) (rather)

## Longer items

Discuss longer agenda items:

- OpenCivics is working on a Participatory Commons Protocol; heavy overlap with activities in AIFS & DAO Primitives, and possibility to collab with projects across AMER & EMEA (rather)

  - Participants are extremely interested in the Toronto area AIFS project and DAO Primitives; Eager to collaborate. Lots of top-tier innovators in web3 civics, participatory budgeting, commons-based governance, community currencies, etc.

  - Sponsoring this collaboration would be more efficient than coordinating/funding this work internally. \~ Tentatively propose allocating some of our Ether to the project to convene participants and communicate this opportunity space.
