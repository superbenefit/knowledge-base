## Longer items

`Add any items which require more in-depth discussion`

- From OS stewards meeting - Put together a plan for delivery of final RPP outputs 

  - Heenal's conversation with Michelle

  - It is more about how we want to capture our work than about what OTF want. 

  - What do we want to tell people about the RPP

1. The knowledge garden - ecosystem of knowledge gardens 

      - Perhaps fund Spencer + Exeunt to put together a knowledge garden artifact and templates etc to that we can publish. Perhaps in the form of a book.   

      - We could ask GreenPill to publish it 

      - These artifacts about knowledge gardens can be added to our own knowledge garden to explain what it is. 

      - Tell the story of community knowledge/data in the AI age. 

      - 

1. Evolution of SB into a community governed innovation network - this is part recap/review of RPP as a project and part evolution of superbenefit. 


1. Tell the story of the emergent nature of decentralized organizing and how the real insights emerged once we started executing on it. 


1. Experiments 

      - AIFS

      - WW-EF 

      - ICS

1. Other narratives 


1. Experiments lead to new opportunities - case study - WW coming in as part of the EF experiments, and this evolving into it's own collaboration and ongoing research opportunity - example of the power of decentralized organizing... 


1. Another example is IFP emerging out of the knowledge garden project in collaboration with other partners and in response to emerging technology


1. Core premise - coordination is hard - but this kind of work can help slow moving orgs to engage with a small fast moving team context to help them engage with a speed of change that they could otherwise never keep up with. We need this if these orgs are going to have any chance of adapting to change
