- ## Check-In

		- **Regrets:  @Aditi **
- ## Intentions & Tensions
	- List and discuss things that you want to see happen/change or any tensions that you are feeling about where we are at in the RPP at this point in time:
		- **Intentions**
			- Kicking off the stakeholder engagement now that we have (hopefully) the funding path sorted. If you're not in these meetings you're missing a lot of the context. How are we catching people up. 
			- Trying to shake some of the legacy entity thinking.
			- Get some experiments underway. Get started 
			- Connection with EF and integrating them into the project
			- Figuring out how to talk about what we are doing spanning internal design language and simple practical communication for partners stakeholders etc
			- Find out how we can share the information about design better. Thinking about having bridges/translators to help with this 
		- **Tensions**
			- Expectations about attendance of meetings 
			- How do we hold our principles at the same time as engaging with the traditional world
			- Balancing theory + design and getting something implemented where more people can be engaged
			- Language to communicate to the different groups we need to engage. How can we figure out the language piece
			- Doing work now vs waiting for funding 
		- **Possible directions of work to do prior to funding being confirmed**
			- Language project 
			- Pushing forward with existing activities across other orgs
			- Pushing forward with the stakeholder group
			- Figuring out how we track contribution - in-kind and financially compensated
