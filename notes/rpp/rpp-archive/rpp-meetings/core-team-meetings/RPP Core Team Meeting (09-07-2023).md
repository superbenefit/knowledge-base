	- OTF - Funding still delayed because questions
	- Project tasks reorganized in Clarity - separation between cell setup / project planning / storytelling
- ## Agenda
	- Need to think about how to constrain the scope of the RP project and outsource some of the complexity (Rowan)
		- For example, some of the nitty gritty could be outsourced to the Primitives team who have already been noodling away on some of these questions
- ## Longer items:
	- Start to layout strategic next steps (Rowan)
		- Who are the stakeholders?
			- CFC are named in project outcomes as the OTF relationship has come though Michelle. NB - Just because they are a stakeholder doesn't mean they should be part of the stakeholder module, which is for groups who are actively engaged with the project.
		- How can we support the Storytelling "cell" in a minimally-intrusive manner?
How can we align on goals & strategy?
	- Review draft Cell State and refine based on latest conversations and decisions (Rowan)
