**Notes**

- We're lacking momentum and the culture has become a bit slow

- Looking at the task board every week should help

- Having workstream checkins will help

- No one is going to get less busy, so we need to figure out how to make progress without people always being there

- Hard to put attention to the project

- Splitting up the SI paper slowed things down 

- It feels like our team has become coordinative, more than collaborative.

  - A lack of rich, high-bandwidth conversation

  - "Using planning to solve an emotional need for certainty"

  - We don't have more shared understanding or clarity as a team than we did -> lack of a feeling of agency

  - The challenge of 'what does autonomy mean?'

- important tasks not getting completed which prevent others from moving forwards

- more communication breakdown, less coherence

- better collaboration when we're time constrained

- need to document what we're doing better

- workstream planning phase 1 date came and went and we didn't know how to react to the fact that not all the deliverables were ready. that was an opportunity for a more generative conversation - questioning what we we're doing and how and whether it serves the project's purpose.

  - eg SI paper aimed to give us a north star but maybe another format could have been used

  - we haven't landed on a shared vision, a shared understanding of what it means to reimagine power in web3. in a certain way we're all lacking confidence in articulating the project. we want to feel aligned, we want to be able to communicate consistently to partners and funders

- we can still move forward on executing projects in parallel _without_ the alignment and shared vision

  - eg moving forwards with an Impact Attestations project in Calgary. don't need much from all workstreams for this

  - tension between actioning projects and growing the collective intelligence

- philanthropy is broken -> something needs to change -> web3 can provide the tools. too much fuzziness in there

  - eg salons with AIFS. we each might have different ideas for why we are doing that and what the outcomes will be
