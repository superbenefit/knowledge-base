# Agenda

Discuss shorter agenda items:

- Catch up on conversation with Shanny on AIFS experiment (rowan)

  - Notes from AIFS Call yesterday

    - AIFS as a playground for people to come together and explore what they're curious about

    - Salon where we invite different groups with different areas of interest to have conversations, share what they're working on

    - Two areas that have a lot of interest from funders/partners that could be experiments within the RPP:

      - impact attestations

      - tools to engage community

    - cross-over with RPP = "what are the new dynamics that we want to experiment with?"

      - eg transformational ways of thinking of the allocating of funding

      - and finding a small, self-contained thing that we can do well at

    - Parks Foundation Calgary has a project underway and the Impact Attestations piece could add on to that

    - MLSE & Jumpstart could also be brought in

    - Next steps?

      - what could initial community conversations look like?

        - could connect with RPP salons work but be separate from it

        - could be an initial salon then one on the theme of sports

          - make sure we record calls! ask rather :) and then once we have a space to host salons on SB we can put the recordings there

      - one-pager in development for calgary parks foundation

      - more next steps will become clearer after AIFS working session next week

        - let's come to a clear collective understanding of what we mean by "impact attestations"

  - question/tension: within decentralized teams, how to ensure that someone takes the lead to complete a deliverable, and how to ensure that things move quickly?

- Social Impact Paper (Michelle)

  - https://docs.google.com/document/d/135hVvXIFUDCZramTzNpEu_6sCsOiop6jnOnmZDZjj3I/edit

  - wondering whether there is anything new in what we have been writing so far? might be good to reconnect, recenter, refocus, get clear on our north star and the purpose of this paper

  - Approaches - critique of philanthropy, original doc where we all inputted was from the group 2) paradigm leap to complexity thinking and fundamentally different approaches that are so far removed from current philanthropy 3) how do we balance between these tensions - not what partners have come forward to be told irrelevant but needs to be an evolution but how do we hold both perspectives

- Stakeholder meeting (Michelle)

  - important to maintain a regular touchpoint, but hard to wrangle dates! more important that all stakeholders can make it than core team.

  - if we switch dates/time, important that everyone feels included and valued

  - Filsan to set up Lettucemeet to share with all

- Interest from Radius to learn about DAO's/ governance experimenting, for creation of a Fund supporting newcomers (Filsan)

  - https://radiussfu.com/

- Michael's availability (rowan)

## Longer items

Discuss longer agenda items:

- Discuss the pace at which we are operating and how things might be sped up

  - idea - add section to core team weekly meeting to note upcoming actions and any blocks

  - idea - "weaver" role, someone to take the lead but short of formal project management

## Action items

- [ ]  will set up a lettuceMeet for the next stakeholder meeting

## Decision log

- 

# Reflection 

> **How have we approached reimagining power in this meeting?**

- discussion around pace and accountability. thinking about coordination scale vs collaboration scale. balancing autonomy and accountability.
