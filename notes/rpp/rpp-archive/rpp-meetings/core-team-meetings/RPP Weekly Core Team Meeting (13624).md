# Check-In

> What are you mad, sad, glad and afraid of today? (You can pass by saying "I'm in")

## Tensions and Intentions

- We added an extra half hour for this meeting in order to allow time to discuss the social impact paper. However, if we can finish up earlier than 90 mins, that would be preferable.
