# Agenda

`Add any shorter items which can be addressed quickly`

- From last week - Discuss the possibility of developing the Impact yield fund around funding the Carolinian Impact Bond (from OS stewards meeting) - defer this to the GC meeting including Michelle

  - Filsan has other ideas about what we could possibly use for this - other impact bonds (e.g Tapestry) etc

  - Possibly jam with Spencer on Web3 and impact bonds and how they relate to regenerative finance etc 

  - We can look at bioregional investment clubs -  if we are not having to generate a return we can invest more in sophisticated impact stuff

- Discussion - what are the other aspects of Impact that we could be connecting to the above. What different orgs we could be connecting with? What pains are people having around Impact bonds? e.g there is no secondary market. What opportunities could be created using web3 tooling (Filsan)
