# Agenda

`Add any shorter items which can be addressed quickly`

- Gatherings compensation (heenal)

  - There's some lack of clarity around what expenses relating to AIFS Gatherings would be covered by the RPP

- Decide what to do about paying BorrowLucid - 

## Longer items

`Add any items which require more in-depth discussion`

- Revisit  the discussion about possible funding from BOANN. Below are notes from last week and from the OS stewards meeting 

  - Discuss options for additional deliverables that could be funded...  Possibly from BOANN Finance. Social finance wholesaler (who Michelle has met with) 

    - Something related to the impact investing space - perhaps write more on impact investing - or propose an experiment that we could run in the impact investing space. 

    - MB - A knowledge product, connected to impact investing or addition to the playbooks - and a related experiment

      - Challenges - impact investing is not popular in the crypto space. Is there a conversation we could have around something that is more interesting in the web3 space. Perhaps investing in hypercerts to fund impact activities. Or thinking about funding protocols that can spin up network effects around an impactful activity (e.g windfall), i.e you only get a return if the network succeeds and delivers impact. 

      - There could be fit in BioFi - finding ways to get capital into land/ecosystems in a way that can benefit from the increase in value but in a way that is protected via a trust (or similar) that prevents investors from getting control of the assets. 

    - Perhaps we could put together a paper that builds from the community to explore what might be possible in the transformation of impact investing. Including web3 and AI possibilities. 

      - We could do a thought leadership piece with some usecases and examples

      - We could do this from community up - perhaps utilizing our gatherings programme to engage the community 

      - Michelle is going to discuss with Filsan and will have a conversation with Brian from BOANN. 

      - Michelle, Filsan, Rowan will meet with Brian and tap in rather as needed 

      - Projects like the Null Fund could be interesting opportunities - pooling capital to kickstart ponzinomic dynamics in regenerative projects - could be attractive to impact investors that are happy to be patient capital and want the impact credentials that are produced (rather than needing a short term gain)
