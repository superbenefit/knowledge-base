	3. Suggestion to develop a Checkout Protocol (Heenal)
		- This is something different from the McCarthy Checkout Protocol
		- Be aware of time constraints in our one-hour meeting
		- It can be nice to have a definite clear end to the meeting. But does that rob us of the opportunity to extend the meeting? Depends how people want the meeting to feel.
		- Word of gratitude or reflection
- ## Longer items:
	1. Review and decide on retroactive funding for the RP project setup period [https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/work/POW-288](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/work/POW-288) (Rowan)
		- ✅ POW-288 Retroactive Funding for Pre-Proposal Planning Period
		- We decided on a lightweight mechanism of contributors outlining their contributions, followed by a quick discussion to determine funding amounts that felt fair and reasonable to all parties.
	2. Review the Needs/Commitments space in the [figjam](https://www.figma.com/file/ct2DHgl4NjNEyqOadB13ml/Reimagining-Power---Project-Planning) and figure out next steps for the project (Rowan)
