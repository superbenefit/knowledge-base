		- meeting booked for mid-November
		- clarifying SB offering/role
	- Governance team is working on defining terms such as "DAO Primitive"
	- Charmverse/Wonderverse - more web3 but Clarity is web 2.5 - cater to more actively engaged web3 - SB can reimagine power in token gates, badges - how can we empower community and agency to folks in SB through permissions, token distros, ownership, etc.
	- OTF - heard that moving along with contract, still figuring out wording
- **Agenda**
	- Stakeholder/Partner Meeting  - can we add to future agenda to discuss format and assign roles for facilitation or book separate meeting (Michelle) 
		- 20 mins in next meeting on Nov 2
	- Compensation and Task Management - changes due to Clarity (Michelle)
		- wonderverse being tested, unsure and looking at other options, have a base outline for task management for compensation
		- we can get started straight away  
		- Review [https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/work/POW-292](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/work/POW-292) 
		- charmverse well capitalized, does require set up for task management, similar to notion but doable, last update was pretty great
	- WREEP onboarding walk-through, perhaps similar to bringing stakeholders 
		- move to next meeting - will add in overview of task management tools to facilitate tool selection
- **Longer Items**
	- Review the [briefing note for OTF](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vW26yTU5Od9sLaU8NfUvliEJpEDMqbKwn8ibsMgsJnI/edit) and see if there are things that we can be starting on now (Rowan) 
		- Things we could progress
			- Transformation mapping work - problems/opportunities in philanthropy [https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/docs/d7c1faa1-7ac8-4733-9e15-f776da01c60f](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/docs/d7c1faa1-7ac8-4733-9e15-f776da01c60f) 
			- Input Requested: **What inequities and financial/coordination bottlenecks are currently visible in the NFP/Philanthropy space? Which are a priority for key stakeholders and their peers?**
				- @rathermercurial had posed this question in the Stakeholder Governance doc [https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/tags/4425810b-50bb-4a6b-baf3-ecc12485300b](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/tags/4425810b-50bb-4a6b-baf3-ecc12485300b)

We wanted to get more input on this as this will be important to reimagining power and we will have the stakeholders add to this as well. 

Would love the insights from those connecting into the Reimagining Power Project  - please add notes and resources here
[https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/docs/d7c1faa1-7ac8-4733-9e15-f776da01c60f](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/docs/d7c1faa1-7ac8-4733-9e15-f776da01c60f)

I have added in the pain points identified this year during our Transforming Capital Initiative at CFC and I will continue to do more research and add information.
			- Working on defining language 
				- could be connection/collaboration between governance and re-storying power cells
			- Defacto Roles
				- engaging with stakeholders and leveraging those relationships, operational roles, re-storytelling cells
				- define those roles and folks can identify roles, and they can own that role
	- Last week's reflection session ran long (for good reason!), should this be a periodic practice? (separate from in/tensions)
		- honour that energy periodically
		- what timing - solstice??
	- Interest in AI (Sue Snider brought this up)
- **Action Items**
	- Decision on charmverse or tooling for Compensation and Task Management and DAO Governance team will test
- **Decisions Log**
- **Reflections**
	- How have we approached reimagining power in this meeting?
		- inclusiveness of the Pagan
