## Longer items

`Add any items which require more in-depth discussion`

- Discussion from OS Stewards meeting 

  - Spencer has developed a JSON LD schema that lists services that orgs have available. We can use this to create a directory of available services for each knowledge garden. Then an LLM can fetch all of the services available across the knowledge commons. This can help with coordination across all of the networks we are connected to. Creating a bit of a services marketplace. 

  - We will need to clarify what we are offering. E.g discovery work - what work, in what context, for whom etc
