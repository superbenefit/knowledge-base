# Agenda

Discuss shorter agenda items:

- Who is considered a Stakeholder and who isn't, and how do we add new stakeholders? (heenal)

  - we are all stakeholders, but the SHG is a specific group of stakeholders who spun up the project. the SHG could choose to add more stakeholders to the group.

  - we specifically designed the governance model such that the SHG doesn't have too much power or say. if someone wants to have say/influence, they should join a cell.

- "Buddy" system as part of onboarding - what would be the role/expectation of a "buddy" and who might be willing to be a buddy? (heenal)

- RPP Stakeholder next agenda - high level intent for next meeting (michelle)

- Nicole intersted in social impact workstream, meeting tomorrow with her - not clear how to engage those not part of core team or stakeholders - relates to Heenal's agenda item above (Michelle)

  - will confirm Nicole as contributor and roles at the meeting
