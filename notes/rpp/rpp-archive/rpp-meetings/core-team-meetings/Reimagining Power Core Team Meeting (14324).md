## Progress Review

**Last Week's Action Items**

Review last week's action items and update status:

- [ ]  will put some costs based on vertical lines for the scope of work for each workstream

---

# Agenda

Discuss shorter agenda items:

- (Rowan) Getting the honorarium to SB

  - 6-7% is a standard admin fee among some DAOs. As a point of reference, Windfall gives 7% of revenues to SB. Do we want to allocate a % - of what amount? - and how would this work moving forwards?

  - What would be the process to do this? Do we need to bring the decision to the SHG or can the Core Team make it?

  - SB role is not a txn fee, it's much more than an admin role; SB network enables us to bring in contributors, for example, and disseminate the results of our work

- (Filsan/Michelle) Boann Finance next steps 

  - Is this work part of RPP or could it run alongside? Could be SB and the salon part overlaps with RPP. Or do they want to run an experiment (self-funded with our support)? Or are they a stakeholder? Let's make sure that whatever they do fits in with our overall structure and strategy and doesn't require us to tear everything down and rebuild.

- (Rowan) Any questions or concerns about compensation proposal?

  - No questions

- (rather) Addressing questions around the [RPP Multisig Signers proposal](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/page-9743176797752586)

  - Everyone now feels comfortable with their wallet setups

  - Send wallet address you want to use to naan

- (rather) Considerations for onboarding and supporting  for playbook strategy

  - Make sure that the playbook understands and encompasses an impact approach and isn't purely technical

  - Discovery calls

    - Not sure of the value of having individual discovery calls with each workstream. Best to have disocvery calls with the core team and the DAO Primitives team and then 2 more tbc. morereese is flexible regarding timing of disovery  calls and who theya re with.

    - Potential discovery calls could be with:

      - Core Team

      - DAO Primitive

      - Philanthropy/Social Impact

      - Equity/Decolonization/Reimagining Power

## Longer items

Discuss longer agenda items:

- RPP Strategy - Review Timelines & $ 

  - Task mgmt & comp moving forward (rowan)

    - Plan activities for season

    - Approve budget for each workstream for the season

    - Workstream lead has the authority (via a hat) to create and allocate tasks (and comp) for workstream tasks. These then **need to be approved by the core team**

    - Core team will need to ensure that tasks are reasonable and are delivering what all the workstreams need for the project goals to be met

  - Q: What is the timeline for "Phase 1"?

    - Think in terms of outcomes (within our control) and not time (out of our control)

    - Some functions naturally follow or are dependent on others

    - Looking at Figjam, let us each (over the next week, async) add circles for work phases for each workstream - similar to the philanthropy workstream. For each "circle", determine what the outcome is that comes out of that

## Action items

- [ ] Team to think through honorarium to SB.   and  to review any contractual implications. And we can re address this next week to get to a decision. 

- [x] Team to send wallet address you want to use to naan by Sunday

- [x] Schedule extra 30 mins for next meeting to discuss strategy

- [x]  will identify Outcomes for each phase of work (inputs) in the near term

- Highlight outcomes in a legible way

## Decision log

# Reflection 

> **How have we approached reimagining power in this meeting?**

- because we went over time, finishing up and having folks do this section async

- giving folks an opportunity to ask questions and input on proposals 

- reflecting on how linked impact investing can be to colonization and traditional finance and as we explore that realm holding that tension
