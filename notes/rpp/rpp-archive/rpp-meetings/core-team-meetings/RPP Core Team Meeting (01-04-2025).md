# Reflection 

> **How have we approached reimagining power in this meeting?**

- Heenal reflected that the yield fund discussion exemplified their approach to reimagining power through:

- Autonomy of group members

- Collective intelligence energy flowing

- Emergent nature of the work rather than top-down decision making

- Not being "set in stone"

He specifically noted this as an example of how their work is "emergent and autonomous" in contrast to traditional top-down approaches.
