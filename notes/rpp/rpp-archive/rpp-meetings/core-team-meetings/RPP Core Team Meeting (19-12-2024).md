# Agenda

`Add any shorter items which can be addressed quickly`

- Gathering #2

  - what do we want to share about SB/RPP/Community Governance?

  - more of a fireside chat with q&a rather than a presentation and provide the q’s ahead for review and prep or keep it conversational and wing it - rm is brilliant & we need their knowledge and experience available to folks as much as possible

  - wait for  to have a conversation about this and plan the format, what questions to ask, etc

  - 

- Boann debrief? (rather)

  - Wait for michelle

  - Questioning whether there is an opportunity with BOANN. It appears that the windfall one is somewhat separate and perhaps should be a separate meeting. We then need to figure out whether there is something that could work for RPP and BOANN. From the last meeting it looks unlikely 

  - 

- Equality Fund experiment update? (Filsan)

## Longer items

`Add any items which require more in-depth discussion`

- Feedback & thoughts on playbook budget & content? (rather)
