# Agenda

Discuss shorter agenda items:

- Discuss allocating honorarium to SB treasury ($5K of funding (I think) went from SB to RPP in advance of RPP funding coming through) - (Rowan)

  - 

- Onboarding lyndon_b (MB)

## Longer items

Discuss longer agenda items:


- Strategy Conversation. (from last week) - Decided to push the strategy conversation to next week when we will have hopefully made enough progress on workstreams to plan next steps (Rowan)

  - how to invite stakeholders to participate to the extent they want to? not have them feel they're not part of it if they don't want to meet every week

  - there are different relationships with different stakeholders. eg with AIFS the project and path forward is more clear; with EF or RI or OTF, it's less clear how we will work together.

  - we haven't yet had a creative session... once prep phase is wrapped up, we can share the artifacts with stakeholders, and then get together for a creative session. we are running into a challenge moving between coordination scale and collaboration scale.

  - 

## Action items

- [ ] Rather to put together a transaction for the SB allocatin for the signers to authorise 

- [ ] Rather will prompt sue to co-schedule a follow-up meeting for deep learning/design of next steps for EF's experiment.

## Decision log

- Team decided to allocate 5kUSDC to the SB treasury as a recycling of the initial funding that SB allocated to the RPP. 

# Reflection 

> **How have we approached reimagining power in this meeting?**

- Thinking about different scales and how we reimagine power through this

- Understanding the relationships with stakeholders
