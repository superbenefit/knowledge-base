	- @Aditi @Rowan  @Filsan met to discuss governance topics and field questions - Feels good
- ## Agenda
	- Michelle - Language framing discussion (from last meeting)
		- DAO Primitives cell will use language that's the most useful, linking to definitions of what they mean by specific terms (eg "Stakeholder") and then for each project we can choose external-facing language that makes the most sense to the stakeholders.
		- It's challenging becaue SB operates in multiple domains and there are overlapping Domain Specific Languages
			- A long-term solution would be to be clarify SuperBenefit's internal language
