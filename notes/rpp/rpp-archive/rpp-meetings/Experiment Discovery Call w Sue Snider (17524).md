## Summary

The Equality Fund will be opening up a new grantmaking stream and call for interest in the coming months. Great opportunity to run a parallel test/experiment that can demonstrate what's possible via Web3.

-

EF has a mature, evolving participatory grantmaking process which faces human scalability issues due to the large number of applications they evaluate. The evaluation process is human-driven, requiring the intake of large amounts of grantee/applicant data and management using conventional SaaS CRM & ERP platforms. This data is accessed by a large, globally-distributed team of evaluators with situational context relevant to the specific grantees/applicants.
