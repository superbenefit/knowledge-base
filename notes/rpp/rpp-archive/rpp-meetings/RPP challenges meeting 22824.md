# Meeting Agenda

Reviewing the challenges highlighted in the SI paper to understand the systems of power that the RPP might experiment on solving.  

What transparency is actually needed?

- Rather than the chain of custody from Philanthropic org to NFP, to programme etc

- We need to be able to prove that the funds are being used in the way that they were intended

**Challenges** 

1. **Power Imbalances in Decision-Making**


1. those effected by the decision are making the decision and are part creating the premise of the decision making space e.g. donor advised funds lack this agency for community

   	-balance all the stakeholders not just donors

   	-allocation decisions to the community, and that those giving donor or attestations care about community

- How can we ensure that power imbalances are addressed in a way that produces better decisions

- How can members of the community participate in decision-making is a way that reflects shared community values, that can surface signals from diverse intelligence in the system and allow the community members who are impacted by the decisions to make the ultimate decision. 

- How can we link together systems across communities in a way that surfaces the community's preferences, create solutions/alternatives, experiments and gather information etc. There is not a single system that will produce everything that is needed

- Need to identify the the business logic by which terms & conditions of funding are derived and enforced.

**2. Lack of Transparency and Accountability.** 

1. We need to ensure that people can access and understand the resources that are passing through the system

2. What transparency is actually needed?

- Rather than the chain of custody from Philanthropic org to NFP, to programme etc

- We need to be able to prove that the funds are being used in the way that they were intended

**3. Underinvestment in BIPOC Communities and Organizations**

- There is a need to invest specifically in actually marginalised communities in order for them to even participate in the civic structures. This is a starting point for being able to surface intelligence from these communities

**4. Inequitable Resource Distribution**

**5. Data and Impact Measurement**

- We need to formal data models and protocols models for impact. This allows us to 

  - 1. Have transparency (as above)

  - 2. Have new ways for people to engage in these systems that address issues of power

**6. Limited Access to Capital for Early-Stage Social Enterprises**

- This is a resource distribution problem. There is bias around risk aversion vs the potential for actual impact

**Rowan's notes**

- **Current flow:**

  - Capital -> Research & decision-making -> Administration -> Recipients

- #1 Power Imbalances in Decision-Making - captures much of the core of the problem

- #2 (lack of transparency) and #5 (data and impact measurement) are functions or capacities that can be improved in any philanthropic system, or could be features of radically new systems

- #3 (underinvestment in BIPOC communities), #4 (inequitable resource distribution) and 6 (limited access to capital for SE's) & 7 are symptoms of the broken system

We are trying to get to better outcomes, better decisions that produce positive impact for the communities affected. 

Our thesis is that if we reimagine power in this context we can produce more intelligent systems that are capable of making better decisions for the complex environments that we are existing in. 

If this is the case then we are looking for the specific systems of power that are structured into the capital -> recipient flow that can be reimagined to produce a more intelligent system capable of producing better outcomes.

Meeting notes - 27/8/24

How do communities engage in civics when they don't have the capacity? (food on the table, time to engage, technical capacities)

- How do we identify coercive systems which can be replaced with non-coercive ones, to meet the needs of these systems while preventing inequities?

  -  E.g how can an eligibility process not overwhelm potential recipients by forcing them through criteria

  - How do we solve for asymmetric decision-making power?

  - How do we solve for risk aversion that creates negative outcomes

- If you shift the power systems without creating better intelligence systems - it can't scale. This is why we need to focus on generating the intelligence we need. 

We need to refine our analytical framework that we can derive a series of questions that we can ask to Sue (and then every other experiment that we are developing)
