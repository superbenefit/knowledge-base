**What inequities and financial/coordination bottlenecks are currently visible in the NFP/Philanthropy space? Which are a priority for key stakeholders and their peers?**

# Summary

The landscape of non-profit (NFP) and philanthropic sectors is fraught with inequities and financial coordination challenges that hinder the effective pursuit of social change. Key stakeholders and their peers express numerous concerns, as outlined by various voices in the field.

## Issues in Funding Distribution

Inequities in funding distribution are evident, with high-profile organizations receiving a disproportionate share. Decision-making, funding priorities, and assets often remain concentrated in the hands of a select few, excluding marginalized communities from crucial discussions.

### Inequities in Resource Allocation

The allocation of resources within the philanthropic sector reveals systemic inequities. Larger foundations often prioritize wealthy donors, sidelining small contributions from everyday people. This approach limits the potential for innovative, community-driven projects, perpetuating the status quo.

### Inefficiencies in Grantmaking Process

The competitive grantmaking process is criticized as inefficient, discriminating against smaller organizations and those less familiar with the grant application “game.” Grantwriting tends to favor projects with measurable outcomes, discouraging innovative approaches.

### Limited Diversity, Risk Aversion, and Restrictive Grantmaking

A lack of diversity in philanthropic leadership contributes to a disconnect between funders and communities. Risk aversion and restrictive grantmaking limit innovative, transformative solutions. Grant decisions are influenced by large donors, potentially diverting funds from vital societal needs.

## Operational Focus Over Social Change

Critiques suggest that many foundations operate as banks rather than social change agents. The focus on endowment growth and adherence to ESG criteria is seen as a minimal effort. Donor advised funds and tax deductions protect wealth but maintain existing power dynamics.

### Challenges in Fiduciary Duty and Continuity

A narrow conception of fiduciary duty tends to keep trusts and charities locked in the status quo. Boards and foundation leadership often prioritize continuity over disruption, hindering transformative efforts. The emphasis on wealthier donors exacerbates this challenge.

### Short-Term Focus and Narrow Indicators

Philanthropy’s short time frames and narrow indicators of impact clash with the long-term nature of deep social change. This approach may lead to overlooking impactful grassroots interventions in favor of proven but less transformative initiatives.

## Call for Systemic Change

Voices within the sector call for systemic change, advocating for more democratic, participatory processes, increased diversity, and a shift away from a focus on short-term gains. Collaboration, inclusivity, and a reevaluation of metrics are emphasized to address these multifaceted challenges

### Philanthropy’s Mimicry of Harmful Practices

Philanthropy is criticized for mimicking harmful colonial practices, relying on legacy systems and institutions. Contributions are often perceived as arriving too late and subject to bureaucratic delays, impacting the effectiveness of aid and amplifying existing issues.

## Conclusion

Inequities and financial coordination challenges in philanthropy demand a comprehensive, collaborative effort. Stakeholders must address systemic biases, prioritize diversity, and reevaluate operational practices to ensure the sector’s effectiveness in driving positive social change

# What to do with this next - ideas from Heenal

1. Collate responses from Team in a Figjam board and cluster by theme

2. What does web3 uniquely enable? Review [STP Figjam](https://www.figma.com/file/uY3nFt3lRZC8q7XfVKG2Xi/System-Transformation-Project?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=NXMHEhIqP9XEhbMP-0) and map which web3 features can address which inequities & financial coordination challenges

3. Research DAOs/projects that are working in these domains

4. Present opportunities for potential projects to tackle challenges that are not yet being addressed in the web3 space

Responses from TeamRESPONSE MICHELLE BALDWINOne of the projects I am working on at Community Foundations of Canada is Transforming Capital where we are convening community foundations, private foundations, other philanthropy support organizations and other actors in the ecosystem. We have culminated the pain points of where folks identified we are getting stuck so some of them might be useful here...we don't need to use all of them and can reword or we can reference this project.A narrow conception of fiduciary duty keeps trusts & charities locked in the status quo.Transformation involves disruption, but boards and foundation leadership largely desire continuity over disruption.Most foundations set their sights on wealthy donors, focusing on large donations over small contributions of money or time from everyday people.Foundations essentially operate as banks, not social change agents, with investment portfolios that can rub against social purposes. ESG (Environmental Social Governance) is a bare minimum.Donor advised funds and charitable tax deductions protect wealth, and keep existing flows of power & control in place.Growth of endowments remains a significant focus and measure of success, preventing new models & practices from taking root.More democratic, participatory processes are labour intensive, requiring coordination that can be hard to achieve at scale.Short time frames and narrow indicators of impact are not aligned with the long-term nature of deep social change.Decisions about financial capital (from investments to property to endowments to granting) remain in the hands of a select few -- those with wealth or professional expertise -- not marginalized communities. Due diligence, risk management unduly influence current decision-making.Short time frames and narrow indicators of impact are not aligned with the long-term nature of deep social change.Social finance models are still predicated on a financial return on investment, which can flow capital to the same ‘proven’ and scalable interventions over ‘riskier’ and grassroots interventions.I would addDecision making, funding priories and assets are not held with those most impacted in communitiesBias and inequitable practices are embedded in the mechanisms for mobilizing, investing and distributing capital.Philanthropy often mimics harmful colonial practices based on legacy systems and institutions.rm additionsPhilanthropic contributions often come too little, too late. Needs and inequities cannot wait 12+ months for paperwork and procedures created by well-off people who landlord over public/civic funds.Context: I participated in a reproductive health access aid group which raised ~600k via a 510(c)(3) financial steward (to provide donors tax receipts), and was told we would receive "expedited" disbursal in 6-12 months. This was under the agreement that 100% of funds would be used for access to abortions. The funds were never provided (stolen) due to "regulatory uncertainty" (we are a safehaven state). This is an extremely common, and even expected outcome when engaging with "philanthropy".When funds do arrive (if they do), they're typically only useful in operationalizing/formalizing existing aid/impact efforts and providing potential longevity to impact networks (which is good)... However those funds are primarily absorbed by compliance requirements which 1.) are expensive and waste effort and 2.) often require excluding beneficiaries who need services most.Philanthropy is seen as an aggressive force which co-opts the efforts of others, more interested in creating "portfolios" and taking credit for work which is often accomplished in spite of funders, rather than because of their contributions.I will add this article to the research about the inequities of nonprofits/philanthropy because it illustrates why board governance is not working - The changing nature of nonprofit boards: The corporatisation of nonprofit boards is diminishing the impact civil society is able to achieve. "The ability to challenge and confront power often comes from a strong resolve, anchored in passion for justice, born out of a constant interrogation of power. When this ability gets compromised, civil society is left weaker. https://idronline.org/the-changing-nature-of-nonprofit-boards/naan additionsnot really sure if this really fits in there so just dropping it here instead but wanna add that the context of what you're doing changes a lot of how you look at thislike my personal experiences are in areas where poverty means something different than here so a lot of the more conceptual problems are imo secondary to the more logistical/operational side of things where all that matters is getting things to where they need to be as fast as possible and sometimes the structures that we have already are efficient in the ways that top down organizations can do thingsbiggest issues to me are the ones that deal with that directly, whether its getting money through whatever hoops it needs to go through or making sure that the money on the ground is actually used for what its supposed to be or finding recurring revenue streams so that communities can have changes that need more than one time funding etcFrom Rowan - One of the biggest challenges that I come across is Philanthropic orgs' inability to engage with uncertainty and risk. Their need to manage their own external optics makes them overly focused on reputation risk. Plus their structure as bureaucracies mean that as they keep adding policies to protect against reputation risk (but never remove any) their decision-making becomes increasingly constrained.Because of this it becomes more and more difficult for them to fund the risky, contrarian or unusual propositions and when they do fund things, they tend to put more and more restrictions on the receiving initiatives. All of this stifles innovation where it is needed most.Some dynamics at play:Actual innovation is by definition uncertain. We can't know what will succeed in advance. Anyone investing in innovation needs to be able to accept the inevitable failures of things they have supportedPicking winners is very difficult, we need to support ecosystems of innovation where most will failActual innovation needs to disrupt existing systems. This will risk annoying incumbents, who in turn can pressure funding sourcesPowerful innovation can often emerge from unexpected approaches, many of which might seem overly narrow at the start. Philanthropic funders tend to favour things that tell a broad inclusive story and that seem like intuitively/obviously good approaches.If a traditional philanthropic org admits that they can't know where the money should go, then they have to question why they existWe need to find ways for funders to be removed from the actual capital allocation decisions. But the mechanism needs to be shown to produce the best/most impactful results (better than the Philanthropic making the decisions as they do today). This can break the reputation risk dynamic. This can allow Philanthropic funders to become much leaner organisations as the capital allocation intelligence can be generated from lower down in the stack, ideally much of it coming from the grass roots.Filsan's ResponseLack of Diversity in NFP/Philanthropy:●      The philanthropic sector, both in terms of donors and foundation leadership, has historically lacked diversity. This can result in a disconnect between funders and the communities they aim to serve.\Limited Risk Tolerance:●      Many NFP/Philanthropic organizations tend to prioritize low-risk, short-term projects, which can hinder innovative and potentially transformative solutions to complex social issues.Restrictive Grantmaking:●      Some funders impose strict limitations and requirements on how their grants can be used, which may not align with the actual needs and strategies of non-profits.Influence of Large Donors:●      Large individual donors or foundations with significant resources can disproportionately influence the philanthropic sector, potentially driving funding toward their preferred causes, which might not align with broader societal needs.Short-Term Focus:●      Some donors emphasize short-term results, which can discourage non-profits from investing in long-term, systemic change.Limited Collaboration Among Philanthropic orgs:●      Philanthropic organizations sometimes operate in silos, missing opportunities for collaboration and coordinated efforts to address complex challenges effectively.Inequities in Funding Distribution:●      Many nonprofits struggle to secure adequate funding, leading to resource disparities. High-profile organizations often receive a significant share of funds, leaving smaller or lesser-known groups at a disadvantage.●      Donors' preferences and priorities sometimes lead to underfunding of crucial but less visible causes, resulting in inequities in addressing various social issues.Lack of Support for Capacity Building:●      Non-profits may not have access to resources for capacity building, staff training, and infrastructure development, hindering their ability to scale and serve their mission effectively. From HeenalThe competitive grantmaking process is extremely inefficient. Countless hours are invested writing applications by organizations who are ultimately unsuccessful and get very limited feedback as to how to improve their applications (or maybe they never actually had a chance of getting the grant anyway).Grantwriting discriminates against organizations with fewer resources, less experience, and those outside the system who don't understand how to play the "game" (which disproportionately includes already those from already marginalized communities)Funders generally decide the metrics - or at least what metrics are allowable - rather than these being driven by those close to the ground. The process encourages a degree of deception - organizations bending their objectives to align with what they think funders want to see, which is far from a collaborative approach.Grantmaking heavily favours projects with measurable outcomes, where those outcomes are known in advance - which heavily biases against more innovative approaches where outcomes are unknown and unknowableGrants are generally very rigid; once grant outcomes have been set, it is impossible or very difficult to chance these, even as circumstances chanceCanada won't (or at least only rarely) recognize a "network" as a charitable function. Hence the London Environmental Network, for example, registered as a charity with the CRA using the name "London Environmental Institute" and London Environmental Network is an operating name of that. The bias towards entities and not networks is telling!There are few spaces for organizations to connect, entity thinking is encouraged and embedded in the system, the ecosystem is not nourished. Where networks do exist, they tend to be networks of organizational leaders rather than of workers/participants in the organizations as a wholeCompetitive funding pits local organizations in the same sector against each other (as they are competing against each other for limited its of funding) rather than fostering collaborationThere is a tendency as organizations get older they become increasingly risk-averse as they want to prevent harm to the organization and maintain the status quo, rather than using the experience and platform they've developed to be more innovativeFunding is generally short-term - one-off grants or 3-4 years at most - which disincentivizes long-horizon approaches and locks organizations into a cycle of seeking funding, applying for funding and reporting on funding, focussing on funding rather than on mission and impact

# **Web3-powered philanthropic initiatives differ from traditional philanthropic initiatives in several key ways:**

## Decentralized Governance

Web3 initiatives leverage decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) for collective decision-making and fund allocation. This enables a more democratic and transparent approach compared to centralized foundations or charities.\[2\]\[3\]

## Transparency and Immutability

By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, web3 philanthropy provides radical transparency into fund flows, spending, and impact metrics. Records are immutable and verifiable.\[2\]\[3\]

## Global Accessibility

Cryptocurrency donations can be received from anywhere globally without intermediaries, reducing barriers and friction.\[2\] This expands the potential donor base.

## Tax Efficiency

Donating crypto can be highly tax-efficient for donors compared to cash donations, incentivizing larger gifts.\[2\]

## Innovative Funding Models

Web3 enables novel funding models like quadratic funding, NFT sales for causes, embedding philanthropy into tokenomics, and global crowdfunding.\[3\]\[4\]\[5\]

## Grassroots Empowerment

Web3 lowers barriers to entry, allowing grassroots organizations and causes to fundraise independently without relying on institutional gatekeepers.\[3\]\[5\]

## Collaboration and Interoperability

Web3 platforms can facilitate data sharing, collaboration, and interoperability between philanthropic initiatives to reduce silos.\[3\]

## Long-term Sustainability

Some web3 models explore sustainable funding through staking rewards, treasury management, and community ownership.\[3\]

In essence, web3 philanthropy aims to democratize and reshape how charitable capital is sourced, allocated, and deployed by leveraging blockchain's transparency, global accessibility, and decentralized coordination capabilities.\[2\]\[3\]\[4\]\[5\]
