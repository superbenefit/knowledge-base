_This document is designed to outline future plans for the Reimagining Power Project (RPP) as it approaches the completion of its first set of funding and deliverables. The RPP core team have engaged in a set of discussions about what the future shape of the project might look like._

## Context 

The first phase of the RPP project will conclude in April 2025. Across the past 18 months, with the support of its stakeholders, with funding from OTF, and with contributions from across its network, the RPP has engaged in several different workstreams and projects as it delivers on its commitments to its stakeholders. Broadly, these have covered:

- Experiments - Equality Fund/Women Win, Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS), RPP internal experiments

- Gatherings - AIFS gatherings program

- Playbooks - Playbooks project and broader knowledge garden project

- Publishing, media, community outreach 

When the RPP was initially set up we designed it around a new experimental governance structure that would allow for the Stakeholder Group to provide initial purpose and goals to the project along with ongoing guidance via the monthly stakeholder meetings. 

Strategy and operational authority is delegated to the RPP core team which uses an operational structure based on the DAO primitives framework. This has allowed the delivery of many aspects of the RPP to in turn be delegated, in a decentralized way, to contributors from within SuperBenefit, from partner organizations (like AIFS) as well as from across other parts of the web3 ecosystem. 

This autonomy and decentralized organizing has allowed the RPP to tap into genuine experts from across different domains in the Web3 space and to engage people who are directly participating in areas we are experimenting in and documenting. 

This decentralized structure has also allowed the project to evolve as new patterns, technologies and memes have emerged. For example, the rapid development and proliferation of LLMs as tools for use in knowledge/data management accelerated dangers to communities who risk losing control of their data as centralized AI models force an extractive model on to under-resourced people and organizations. The RPP was able to accelerate focus on exploring using a combination of crypto infrastructure and AI tooling to enhance data sovereignty for communities as a response to this acceleration.

 

The next phase of the RPP, outlined below, is based on what has emerged as opportunities for reimagining power for the project to lean into this potential.  

## RPP Priorities 

There are three areas that the RPP project is interested in exploring in this next phase. These are continuations of the work that we have done to date but also reflect the project tightening in on the opportunity spaces that  present: our strongest opportunities to contribute, the highest potential impact, and the areas of most interest to our own and partner communities.

These 3 priorities are: 

1. **Community Governed Innovation Networks** - Current RPP experiments demonstrate how DAO-based community governance, powered by Web3 tools and practices, can effectively mobilize community contributors and forge partnerships in ways traditional organizations cannot. These networks have the potential to unlock creativity, capital, and coordinated action to address societal challenges. This model could evolve into new forms of community foundations, charities, and philanthropic organizations.

2. **Social Finance Innovation** - Practical applications for transforming social finance are now becoming viable. The RPP has identified several areas for experimentation, including: philanthropic yield funding mechanisms and verifiable place-based impact measurement and reporting community-governed resource allocation, and on-chain funds distribution systems.

3. **Community coordination and knowledge sharing** - There is huge potential to continue RPP's work on developing tools and frameworks to make community practices, knowledge and wisdom more accessible and sharable. With rapid advancements in AI tools, this opportunity space has been accelerated with concepts that we thought were years away becoming possible now. 


## Next Steps for RPP

As we move into this next phase for the project the above priorities could manifest in different ways. What the RPP focuses in on will depend on input from partner organizations (such as the current stakeholder group), the availability of funding for specific projects, and the shape of the opportunities that are rapidly emerging.    

The following outline of potential opportunities is not a to-do list. Instead, they are the projects and activities that the core team feel are both aligned with the project's purpose and are practically possible, technically feasible and potentially fundable. A strength of the decentralized structure that the project runs on is that it can leverage community intelligence to flexibly evolve and adapt based on the flow of resources and community interest.  

**Securing Initial funding**

The RPP will seek a core funder whose contribution would support the heart of the RPP and allow for it to best utilize its network structure to find and execute on experiments that would deliver the most impact towards its goals. 

This resourcing would fund activities that build on Phase One outcomes through continued community building, knowledge product creation, and experiments. The Ontario Trillium Foundation is an ideal partner to provide this core funding, creating a foundation upon which RPP could leverage additional partners and resources to develop projects and experiments (listed below).

### 1. Community Governed Innovation Networks

A large focus of RPP Phase One has been devoted to creating tools and practices for creating web3-enabled community networks. We have been applying these tools and practices in the RPP experiments and codifying them for others to use as playbooks.

We have been using these same tools and practices within the RPP (and SuperBenefit more broadly) to implement our own community-governed innovation network - a community-governed structure that can leverage a network of people and resources in decentralized ways to execute on many different projects.  

We see the continuation of the RPP as being, at one level the continued development of these opensource tools and practices for others to use, and also the continued development of SuperBenefit as a larger experiment in using these web3 tools and practices to build community-governed innovation networks.

The intention is to demonstrate that purpose-aligned networks can:

1. Coordinate large numbers of small experimental projects in flexible and adaptable ways.  

2. Effectively allocate resources where they can have the greatest impact, based on community input.

3. Leverage diverse talent and intelligence from across large networks.

Continuing to develop web3 tools and practices (such as the Community Governance and DAO Cell playbooks) and continuing to apply them in SuperBenefit and in the next phase of the RPP, will help the RPP explore a new model for community foundations, grantmaking, and other traditional philanthropic funding organizations and mechanisms. 

We propose continuing to develop this across the following categories: 

1. **Continue to develop organizational infrastructure** 


1. Extend the development of the playbooks project based on continuous learning through applying these patterns and primitives in ongoing RPP experiments

2. Develop tools to make these resources more accessible within and beyond the SuperBenefit network.  

3. Develop tools and experiments in community funding - e.g quadratic funding, impact attestations and Hypercerts


1. **Continue to build connections and knowledge transfer**


1. Bridge the space between web3 players, philanthropy, bioregional groups, community organizations etc through publishing research and insights emerging in the RPP. The RPP is uniquely placed to span these currently mostly disconnected worlds.

2. Continue and evolve the gatherings program as a means to share knowledge and insights, build partnerships and weave connections between ecosystems

### 2. Social Finance Innovation 

There are several emerging opportunities to experiment in the social finance space. 

1. **Philanthropic Blended Finance Funds -** there are currently several project using DeFi primitives to construct yield-bearing funds to finance community impact. There is an opportunity for RPP to facilitate a partnership that would create a novel blended finance capital fund. Two initial opportunities are:


1. Develop an impact yield fund based around generating DeFi yield in excess of the risk-free rate for philanthropic endowment capital. Then assigning the excess yield to impactful ventures via a web3 capital allocation mechanism. 

2. Develop a version of a community yield fund based on a Null Fund concept. A Null Fund is a DeFi primitive that allows for a funder to be paid a return but for some of their capital to, over time, become permanently locked in an on-chain community fund. This fund would then produce an unencumbered return that could be used at the community's discretion. 


1. **Place-based impact assessment -** there is a lot of innovation happening in web3 around how to use technologies such as Hypercerts and on-chain attestations to build mechanisms to create community-informed and enabled impact measurement systems. The transparency and trust mechanics that blockchain based systems can provide have significant potential to transform how impact assessment is done. 
   SuperBenefit is connected with several high-quality projects innovating in this space and we are already experimenting with Hypercerts as part of an existing [RPP experiment with ICS](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/ics-experiment-implementation-plan-9346255468646649). We could, with relative ease, convene a set of partners to develop a place-based impact assessment project. 

2. **Onchain community funding mechanisms** - there are several directions that the RPP is exploring in the space of on-chain community funding:


1. **DeFi payments** - extending the experiment we are running with Equality Fund and Women Win to create shareable playbooks for DeFi-enabled privacy payments. Helping communities to leverage DeFi rails to move money cheaply, securely and with rich privacy configurations.  

2. **Community resource allocation** - building on existing partnerships and experiments there is an opportunity to develop practice and resources to support communities to leverage decentralized funding primitives like quadratic funding/voting to innovate on how they make funding decisions at the local level. There are also opportunities to explore using AI to enhance these community funding mechanisms. 

### 3. Community coordination and knowledge sharing

There are several exciting opportunities to continue to experiment with and develop AI enabled knowledge sharing infrastructure. A large part of Phase One of RPP has been creating useful knowledge products, and developing ways to structure and make these tools accessible. There are several opportunities to develop projects in the domains of community coordination and knowledge sharing:

1. **Making community knowledge accessible** - Communities often accrue large repositories of knowledge. This is especially true for research organizations. AI agent technology creates the opportunity for these communities to surface and share this knowledge while managing risks. The[ infinite front porch project](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/concept-note-for-an-ai-agent-swarm-project-8671287658579254) - is a proposed RPP project to develop a multi-community-network AI agent swarms that can make participating community's data, knowledge and wisdom open and shareable but also protected, sovereign and controllable.   

2. **Enhancing community governance** - There is an acceleration in the development of AI-enabled governance and operational tooling. Applying AI to support DAOs and other decentralized communities to operate and effectively self-govern is a hugely important opportunity. In order these new ways of organizing to scale to mainstream adoption, governance needs to be streamlined and made more user-friendly. 
   

## Conclusion

As mentioned above, the RPP will not execute on all of these opportunities. And, over the course of the next phase of the project, new opportunities will likely emerge that better serve the RPP's goals. One of the great benefits of the RPP's decentralized structure is that it enables parallel exploration of multiple initiatives while dynamically allocating resources based on demonstrated potential and impact as it is discovered (or not).

The critical role of OTF as a potential core funder is an important first step in planning for this next phase of the project. Once this core ongoing partnership is established, the RPP core team can work on redefining the RPP Stakeholder Group and stakeholder governance for the next phase of the project, integrating new partners to the group who align with the project's evolving vision. Out of this a refined purpose for the project can be defined by the Stakeholder Group which will inform the core team in developing the project's Phase Two strategy.
