# Tactical Meeting protocol
Refer: [meeting template snippet ](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/snippet/1d6d1fc5-d68b-468b-8177-1cefc97edfe3)

### Facilitator: 
- Each meeting should have a facilitator who helps the team to get through the meeting agenda and to capture the decisions and actions
- ==**Reimagining Power Cell specific** - RP meetings will utilise a revolving facilitator with different team members stepping into the role on a rostered basis==

### Checkin :
(see checkin protocol)
### **Attendees:**
- List

### Updates:
- Brief updates from each team member to bring the team up to speed on what has been happening across the team

### Agenda:
- Team members add agenda items prior to or during the meeting. Usually short items such as decisions that need to be made in order for them to progress their work. When adding an agenda item, the name of the person adding it should follow the item in brackets.
- The team then collectively prioritise the agenda, moving longer items to the discussion topics section (e.g items requiring more than 5 mins of discussion)
- The team then move through the agenda items as quickly as possible. If it turns out that larger discussion is needed then the item should be moved to the discussion topics section

### Discussion topics:
- Items that have been moved from the main agenda that require more discussion
- Items that team members are adding that they know will require longer discussion
- Items from the previous meeting that were rolled over to the current meeting
- When the agenda is finished, prioritise the discussion topics based on the time remaining in the meeting. If there are items that can't be dealt with in the time remaining, decide to either
	- 1. Extend the meeting to deal with them.
	- 2. Push them to the next meeting or set up another time to discuss them.
	- 3. Delegate these discussion to a subset of the team to work on at another time. 

### Decisions log:
- A list of the decisions made in the meeting

### Actions:
- A list of all of the commitments made in the meeting, ideally with a "by when" date/time

### Reflection: 
- ==**Reimagining Power Cell specific **- how have we approached reimagining power in this meeting?==

### Notes:
- Suggest  -  People should reflect on what they want from a meeting and make sure that they are trying to achieve something valuable from their attendance. If the meeting is not valuable to a participant then consider proposing a change - e.g not attending in future, changing the meeting format,  participant group, scrapping the meeting etc

# Decider protocol
- Who's it for? -  the core team of a Cell, or any collaborating group that needs to make decisions
- Goal - for the team to make consent based decisions quickly
- ### Format:
	- Proposer says/writes “I propose [concise, actionable behaviour].”
	- Proposer counts/writes "1-2-3"
	- Voters vote simultaneously (or asynchronously if online), with: 
		1. Thumbs up (YES)
		2. Thumbs down (NO)
		3. Flat hand (Support it)
	- If there is a NO vote then the proposal is blocked. The proposer can then have a conversation with the NO voter and see if they can modify the proposal to make it acceptable. 
	- Proposer withdraws the proposal if the _NO_ or _Support it_ votes are too great i.e the effort it would take to fix the proposal suggests that it is too far off base for the team to get behind. As a soft rule, a proposal that receives less than 70% yes votes is a weak proposal and should be withdrawn, but this decision is up to the proposer.
	- If the full team isn't present for a decision, the missing team member should make themselves aware of any decisions that are made in their absence. 
	- Approved proposals should be logged. Minor operational decisions occurring in a meeting should be logged in the meeting doc. Those occurring in messages can remain in the channel they occurred in. More consequential decisions (such as Treasury management or changes to the Cell State) should be recorded in the Cell's decision log.

### Commitments
- If a proposal passes, all members of the team (even those who were a flat hand) are expected to get behind it. If a team member doesn't like a decision that was made without them, they can propose an alternative direction and trust that the team (including them) will decide on the best direction for the team/project.  
- Team members cannot opt out of specific decisions. If they are present then they need to participate in a decision (no abstentions). If a team member is away, or is in some other way unavailable however (e.g overwhelmed by workload), they can opt out of decisions in general and let the team know to make decisions without them. 
- For votes taking place in digital formats (async), team members commit to responding within a fixed number of hours.
- Team members use their capacity to "stop the show"  - i.e voting NO and refusing to compromise on getting to a version of the proposal that can pass - very carefully. This should only be used when the cost to the team in loss of momentum and progress is justified (by either the prevention of something very bad happening or the introduction of a fundamentally better idea).
- Making decisions in large groups is hard. Avoid using this protocol in groups of more than 7-8 people. If the group is too big, break into smaller groups to make decisions and trust that these groups will make good decisions on behalf of the group. 
- ==**Reimagining Power Cell specific** - the RP core team commit to responding to online decider proposals within 48 hours==

### Notes
- Decider can be modified when needed to make other types of decisions. It can be adapted into either a **consensus **decision type (everyone must give a thumbs up for it to pass) or a **majority rules **decision (a simple thumbs up/thumbs down vote where a majority must be thumbs up and a thumbs down vote will not block the decision).
- This protocol works best for making fast decisions with the confidence that everyone in the team will support them. 
- We are trying to get the the best decision. Generally speaking, making a decision and generating momentum and learning is better for a collaborating team than doing nothing and waiting.
- The team can also opt to make decisions without the full team needing to participate, but this is up to the team to decide.

# Check-in Protocol 
- Who's it for - any collaboration scale team wanting to get collectively present and improve communication to get work done
- Goal - to help individuals to become aware of their emotional state in the moment and to share this with their team in a safe way that promotes more high-bandwidth communication and creates a more highly functioning team
- ### Format:
	- Speaker says "I feel (one or more of Mad, Glad, Sad, Afraid" The speaker may provide a brief explanation
	- Speaker says "I'm in" expressing that they are aware of their emotional state and able to be fully present in the conversation
	- Listeners respond "Welcome" 
- ### Commitments 
	- Checking in is an offer not a requirement. People can check in to the level they want and pass entirely if they wish
	- State feelings without qualification - eg "I am sad about...."  not "I am a little bit sad but mostly okay about..."
	- State feelings as they pertain to yourself 
	- Be silent during other's check-ins
	- Do not refer to other people's check-in disclosures either in conversation with them or with others unless explicitly granted permission to do so 
	- If giving detail, keep these to a concise sentence for each item being "checked in". Don't overshare or go into unnecessary detail 
- ### Notes 
	- Check-in is typically used at the start of a meeting, but can be use at any time when someone feels that it would add value to the group dynamic
	- Any person can check in at any time. If more than one person decides to check in, then it is often useful for everyone to follow
	- Check in as deeply as you feel able to. Checking in 2 or more emotions is the norm. The deeper the collective check-in, the more aligned the team becomes and the better their results
	- "Happy" can be substituted for "Glad" and "Scared" for "Afraid"

# Check-out Protocol (DRAFT)
- **Goal**
	- To ensure that individuals have gotten what they need out of the meeting, that everyone can leave in a good way feeling heard, and that the team expresses its gratitude for one another
	- To do this in a way that feels meaningful and doesn't take up more time than is necessary
- **Format**
	- Facilitator asks "Is there anything else you need to share during this meeting in order to feel complete?"
	- Speaker either says "I feel complete" or shares what they need to say in order to feel complete. This could be a word of gratitude, a reflection on the meeting, an important notification to participants, or something else entirely.
	- Speaker says "I'm out" 
	- Listeners respond "Thank you" 
- **Commitments**
	- There is no obligation or pressure to share something. "I feel complete" is a perfectly valid and normal response! At the same time, all sharing is welcome, whatever the topic. it is up to the Speaker to decide what they need to share.
	- Don't overshare or go into unnecessary detail. This is not an opportunity to enter into discussion on items that could have been added to the agenda earlier.
	- Be silent during others' check-outs
	- Checking out is an offer not a requirement. People can check out to the level they want and pass entirely if they wish
- **Notes**
	- Check-out is typically used at the end of a meeting, but can be used at any time when someone is leaving a meeting
