- **Current Status**: The team is currently not collaborating and coordinating as effectively as possible.

- **Next Steps**: Updates to core team agreements are needed to reflect the next phase of the project.

## Core Team Collaboration

### Admin Workstreams

Lacks coordination and a clear view of ongoing tasks. It's unclear what tasks are dependencies and which are parallel workstreams. Most tasks are progressing slowly.

- Onboarding: Onboarding flow 95% complete. Onboarding guide in progress.

- Social Impact: The paper is progressing, and the intention is to shift to a shorter summary, as there is an immediate need to integrate core insights into team design conversations for next steps. Partner convening underway.
 -RPP Social Impact and Onboarding Bi-Weekly Working Meetings were combined

- Knowledge Stewardship: Main Phase 1 tasks are complete. Some bounties need to be filled, ready for Phase 2. Assistance needed from onboarding to fill bounties.

- Primitives: Initial framing is complete. Formatting for readability based on core team feedback is needed. More insights from the core team are required to enhance usefulness.

### Experiments

- Calgary Parks Impact Attestation Experiment:

  - Defining an impact attestation schema and figuring out an impact scope to organize the attestations (similar to a hypercert).

  - Need to provide the technical design basics and support implementation. The project is waiting for us to provide a one-pager design proposal to the Calgary Parks Foundation.

- Equality Fund:

  - Possible scope of experimentation identified. Need to reconnect with EF on discovery & scoping

- Institute for Community Sustainability:

  - Further communication with local partners is needed to determine potential areas for experimentation. An alternative experiment (to be discussed) could be to design a DAO-like structure for ICS.

### Deliverables

- SuperBenefit Gatherings:

  - This initiative aims to weave together network members as part of a community initiative. Partnership with AIFS involves key participants such as Shanny, Nicole, Heenal, and Filsan.

  - Shanny is working on a proposal to the Ontario Trillium Foundation (OTF) with resource planning and proposal feedback from Madam Cult Leader.

  - [Proposal](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/initial-funding-coordination-for-superbenefit-gatherings-5734408797738995) for initial funding for gatherings and additional gatherings is in progress.

- SuperBenefit Playbooks:

  - Feedback from the core team is awaited to proceed. 

  - MoreReese should be paid for the discovery report and a lite strategy for moving forward.

  - Networking with other Playbook creators at OpenCivics to collaborate on outputs, potentially resulting in strategic synergy and resource sharing.

  - Expected outputs include a meta playbook (DAOs and Philanthropy playbook) and other playbooks created in collaboration with OpenCivics.

- Patterns/Infra:

  - Generating a pattern template using the Moloch for Sociocracy design as a starting point.
 Collaboration with OpenCivics to develop patterns and a presentation/delivery mechanism (e.g., a web frontend, potentially using the Knowledge Commons frontend).

- Other Media:

  - Exploring opportunities for podcast episodes.

    - Working on podcast interview on the local impact of Network State projects with TBS

    - Potential partnerships with podcasters such as Drew Simon.

  - Need to write RFP for media to inform & reward creators
