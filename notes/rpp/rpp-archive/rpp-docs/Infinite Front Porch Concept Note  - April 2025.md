# Infinite Front Porch - Concept Note

### **_Creating community-owned knowledge commons_**

In an increasingly digital world, vast reservoirs of human knowledge and wisdom remain untapped because they exist beyond the reach of current technology. The Infinite Front Porch project aims to bridge this gap by creating networks of AI agents that work with human partners to gather, preserve, and share knowledge from traditionally excluded sources. By combining emerging AI capabilities with community-owned infrastructure, we are building systems that allow communities to surface and leverage their collected knowledge and wisdom, while retaining ownership and control of their community knowledge assets. 

The project is a partnership between a collective of leading web3 organizations who are each working on knowledge mobilization and more traditional non-profit, philanthropic and government organizations who have an interest in developing knowledge commons infrastructures. 

## Background 

The convergence of LLMs and Web3 infrastructure has created an unprecedented opportunity to reimagine knowledge sharing. While current systems require centralizing information through large technology providers, advances in small -scale LLMs that can be run locally–combined with privacy-preserving blockchain technology, now enable a new approach. These technologies combined allow communities to maintain sovereignty over their data while participating in powerful emerging information networks, unlocking vast networks of knowledge and wisdom that have remained beyond the reach of traditional digital systems.

## Core Concept and Vision

**_Crypto-enabled, local-first AI agent swarms to unlock community knowledge and wisdom_**

This project envisions the creation of community owned knowledge commons. This will involve a community making its collected information accessible to a locally run LLM that can query and derive insights from it. 

This LLM will then be made accessible/interoperable with a set of LLMs that source knowledge from similar community knowledge bases, turning the entire network of knowledge libraries into a single large knowledge commons. 

This makes accessible and useful huge amounts of valuable information from across multiple communities, allowing for previously siloed information to be discovered and intelligently curated, and ultimately allows it, and the work of the community that produced it, to impact the world positively.

The other key feature of this model is the emphasis on community data sovereignty. We will leverage local-first LLMs and decentralized technologies to ensure that communities can benefit from the use,  share and even profit from their valuable knowledge, without loosing control of it.

The project will design architecture that enables each community to maintain its own AI tooling working on its own knowledge infrastructure. A swarm protocol will then coordinate LLMs form from across a network of communities, linking these communities into a knowledge commons.

Unlike closed systems that centralize control, our approach creates bridges between communities and welcomes all voices, especially from underrepresented sources. Through this design, communities maintain full ownership of their data while participating in the knowledge commons, determining their own levels of sharing and ensuring ethical engagement and mutual benefit.

**Community Benefits**

- Data sovereignty - community ownership and control of knowledge resources

- Selective sharing - granular control of what knowledge to share and to whom.

- Economic opportunity - the possibility of generating income from knowledge shared into the commons.

- Enhanced collaboration - making it more efficient for communities to work together.

- Reduced complexity - simplifying the difficult challenge of information and data interoperability.

- Democratic access - making sure AI capabilities serve the needs of communities

## Implementation 

_This innovation is possible for the first time because of recent breakthroughs in open-source LLMs and decentralized infrastructure. This presents a moment in time where an alternative to large centralized domination of our digital spaces is actually possible._

_In addition to technical breakthroughs, there is a significant movement within the web3/DAO/regen space to create carefully structured knowledge resources to share the outputs of community research, design and best practice. This includes the creation of knowledge gardens, playbooks, pattern libraries etc._

The initial proof of concept, for the Infinite Front Porch project involves developing small-scale, local-first, AI enabled knowledge infrastructure for several project partner communities (outlined below). Then connecting these knowledge bases together into a single multi-community knowledge commons. 

**Roadmap - Proof of Concept:**

1. Supporting partner communities to structure and complete their community knowledge resources making them compatible with LLM systems.

2. Designing and testing community owned LLM systems that can access community knowledge resources

3. Developing repeatable methodologies that different communities utilize to create their own knowledge resources and LLM systems.

4. Developing an interaction protocol that can pull together these different LLM enabled community knowledge resources into a single accessible queryable system.

Critical to the development of these systems is ensuring that they can be fully community owned and managed. They must be:

- Simple to use

- Capable of being locally run, or in a private cloud environment

- Adaptable to evolve to deliver on the specific needs, goals and values of each participating community

- Have security properties that fit the needs of the community 

**Phase Two:**

Upon completion of this proof of concept stage of the Infinite Front Porch project, the partners will scope and fund the development of a more complete system that is sufficiently robust for implementation in organizations outside the initial partner set. The initial partners are all comfortable with web3 technologies as well as decentralized models of governance and funding. The post-proof of concept audience will be more traditional organizations who require a more refined user experience as well as more robust guarantees regarding security and reliability of data and systems. 

## Partners

**Project Partners**

The Infinite Front Porch project is a partnership between [SuperBenefit](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/info-hub-8590899773427281), [Gaia AI](https://www.gaiaai.app/), [Crypto Commons Association](https://www.crypto-commons.org/), [Labour DAO](https://thelabordao.com) and [All in for Sport](https://allinforsport.org). The partner networks will collaborate in the project using decentralized organizing principles and infrastructure.  

Partners are community networks who are currently developing and maintaining open-source knowledge libraries and are already exploring LLMs as a means of making these resources more accessible. As progress is made and funding secured, we will look to add other complementary networks to the partnership. 

**Funding partners**

There are several non-web3 organizations (non-profit, philanthropic & government organizations) who are interested in the development of this kind of AI enabled decentralized community knowledge commons approach. There is an opportunity for these organizations to fund and participate in the development of the Infinite Front Porch Project. This will create an opportunity for these organizations to learn about the project itself and the technology used to create it, but also have a first hand experience of decentralized governance and coordination between organizations and networks.

Phase Two of the project creates the opportunity for partners to support the development of the more complete knowledge commons system. This could be developed specifically for the use cases and community contexts that these partners are interested in developing for. 

## Governance & Operations

The project will be housed within the SuperBenefit network and will be set up to coordinate activities and funding across the partner networks to deliver on the shared needs of the project. 

This will utilize decentralized governance primitives and practices–that are standard practice in web3 organizations–to ensure that partners have sufficient input in high-level governance decisions, while creating a level of operational autonomy and freedom for those executing on the project.  

Funding partners will participate in a stakeholder governance role, engaging in high-level governance decisions as well as having the opportunity to have staff members participate in operational roles in the project, if desired.  

Strategy and day-to-day decision-making will be done by the decentralized operational structure and driven by those who are contributing to the projects execution.  

## Next Steps

The following next steps are currently underway in the Infinite Front Porch Project. 

1. Finalize agreements between project partners - obtaining consent from SuperBenefit, Gaia AI, Crypto Commons Association, Labour DAO and All in for Sport to formalize the project partnership

2. Fundraising, from potential funding partners - interested non-profit, philanthropic and government partners to join the project. Funding will also be sought from web3 funding opportunities such as community quadratic funding rounds. 

3. Putting in place governance and coordination agreements and infrastructure for the project to run on. Onboarding project partners and funding partners into the governance structure. 

4. Executing on the project.

 

Funding partners are being sourced to resource the project roadmap, continuing the work already underway on this project to make the vision of the infinite front porch a reality. We envision the full road map being completed within 12 months.
