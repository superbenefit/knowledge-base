# Core Agreements

The core agreements are working agreements which relate to the cell's purpose and apply to all activity within the cell.

## Shared Purpose

- The core team will determine how the purpose of this cell is crafted and kept.

- The core team will provide a canonical statement of this purpose in the [cell state](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/cell-state-reimagining-power-tlc-4808293440840059).
