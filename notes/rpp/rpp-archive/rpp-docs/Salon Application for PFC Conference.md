# Draft 

## **Why are you self-nominating/nominating this individual?**

I am self-nominating to co-lead a session providing an introduction to the potential of web3 and blockchain technologies for the philanthropy sector, and to share our pioneering work in the “Reimagining Power Project.”

Emerging technologies create new ways to collaborate, create, and share value and authority. But what is web3? And is there an emerging crypto philanthropy? This session will explore how new technologies can impact philanthropy, equity, and systems change. Participants will discuss the implications of web3 for decentralized ownership and governance models and the opportunity philanthropy has to leverage these approaches for a better future.

The “Reimagining Power Project” is a collaboration between Canadian and international nonprofits and charities with a profound purpose: to explore how web3 can shift power, transform systems, and shape better futures. In the session, we will present insights on how the concept of DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) as purpose-driven networks of small autonomous teams can redistribute power, value flows and resources across society at scale.

## **Any Further Question/Comment?**

Heenal Rajani, Filsan Farrah, and Michelle Baldwin, who collaborate in SuperBenefit DAO, will co-facilitate this session.

SuperBenefit, focusing on web3 technologies for systemic transformation, provides a unique perspective on leveraging these tools for social impact. SuperBenefit’s mission is to develop the social and financial flywheels that enable the invention and acceleration of a better world. This includes strengthening capacities for systems innovation and supporting people to clarify pathways towards shared goals. SuperBenefit’s work includes researching and incubating initiatives that harness the emerging technologies and practice of web3 (DAOs, NFTs, DeFi) in pursuit of systems transformation.

The facilitators have a solid background in the nonprofit sector and have extensively engaged with web3 topics, including presenting at CFC’s conference last year and writing articles. This session will not only provide insights into the Reimagining Power Project but also demonstrate the practical application and potential of web3 in philanthropy. We will also invite any interested conference attendees to join us in an ongoing series of web3 salons where those in the philanthropic sector can learn together and collaborate on maximizing the opportunities for social benefit and collective impact that these new technologies offer.
