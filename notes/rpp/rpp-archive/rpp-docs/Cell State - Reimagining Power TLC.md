# Purpose

### Overarching project Purpose 

- To explore how web3 can shift power, transform systems and shape better futures. In particular, how the concept of DAOs as _purpose_ _aligned networks of small autonomous teams_ can redistribute power, value flows and resources across society at scale.

### Cell specific Purpose 

- The early purpose of this Cell is to help shape up the beginnings of the Reimagining Power project. To design the early structure and tooling for bringing the partners together to start to define and the subsequent evolution of the operational activities of the project. As proposals are passed and initiatives are spun up within the project, the purpose of this Cell will change as will the make-up of its core team and contributors, its practices, etc

### Relationship to SB + Stakeholders

- **This will be defined as the partners come together and the governance of the project takes more shape.** 

- At this early stage the Cell has been created and funded by SuperBenefit (via [this proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/superbenefit.eth/proposal/0xdee77e3d0c41591bec2b880928755295a3bb4658a7950a95a7e954cac6c189c2)) and operates under the umbrella of SuperBenefit's norms and practices.

- The core team will work in partnership with the RPP Stakeholder Group. The SHG will define its shared purpose and high-level goals for the project which the Core team will use as a reference to develop it's strategy and implementation of the project.

- The details of further agreements between the Core Team and the SHG will be outlined here:
