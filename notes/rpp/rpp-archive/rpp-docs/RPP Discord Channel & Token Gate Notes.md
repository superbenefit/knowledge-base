## New Discord Roles

These roles provide customizable access to Reimagining Power channels. Members can use the `join` command to receive earned roles.

Roles are **Hat-Gated**. Participants must claim a hat or receive a guest pass (stakeholders only) to receive a role.

Token gates in Charmverse use the same requirements as the Discord token gates.
