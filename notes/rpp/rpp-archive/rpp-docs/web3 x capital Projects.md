**SuperBenefit** **Projects**

**Infinite Front Porch** 

Overview: This project envisions the creation of community owned knowledge commons. This will involve a community making its collected information accessible to a locally run LLM that can query and derive insights from it. This LLM will then be made accessible/interoperable with a set of LLMs that source knowledge from similar community knowledge bases, turning the entire network of knowledge libraries into a single large knowledge commons. This makes accessible and useful huge amounts of valuable information from across multiple communities, allowing for previously siloed information to be discovered and intelligently curated, and ultimately allows it, and the work of the community that produced it, to impact the world positively.

Partners: SuperBenefit, Gaia AI, Commons Economy Roadmap, Labour DAO and All in for Sport.

**All In For Sport Projects**

**Unlocking Money & Tech for Grassroots Sports**

Overview: How can grassroots sport — a powerful force for community cohesion — also unlock innovation in financial access and governance? The answer lies in giving communities direct control over funding flows and decisions. Together Sarreya Sports, love.fútbol, Bonito Foundation and All In For Sport will pilot a web3-enabled digital platform that empowers local organizations in historically marginalized communities. By removing financial bottlenecks and building digital tools that prioritize transparency and local control, we aim to make it easier and fairer for community-rooted sports groups to receive, manage, and govern funds. Using secure digital accounts that communities control themselves, collective budgeting, transparent governance systems — this innovation shifts control to those doing the work on the ground. Rooted in equity and designed for adaptation and replication, this pilot begins in Somaliland, where traditional finance systems have yet to serve local actors, and lays the foundation for broader, sustainable development outcomes through sport-led innovation

**Fostering community governance of local sports spaces**

Overview: All In For Sport and love.fútbol are excited to partner with Chiliz, the sports blockchain. Chiliz has a strong foundation in elite sports and fan tokens, and is now poised to expand its scope by enabling more real-world use cases across grassroots and community sport. All In For Sport (AIFS) and love.fútbol are uniquely positioned to support this expansion by designing credible, testable, community-based governance experiments that can help bring meaningful, on-chain activity to the Chiliz ecosystem. We bring: Community infrastructure: trusted relationships with global sports-for-development organizations, funders, and web3-native impact projects Technical governance know-how: DAO operators contributors with strong experience in building participatory on chain and off chain systems Alignment with Chiliz roadmap: Chiliz is deploying the Aragon OS stack and Gnosis Safe, which aligns with our own tooling experience and governance design practice This partnership offers a unique opportunity to learn, test and implement Chiliz’s new governance tooling in the wild. We would also explore alignment with other pilots you are supporting (e.g. the FC Barcelona innovation hub) to identify synergies or co-learning opportunities.
