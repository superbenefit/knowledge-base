The cell state document is intended to serve as an up-to-date reference for information related to the agreements, operations and relationships of the Reimagining Power cell.

# Purpose
- ### Overarching project Purpose 
	- To explore how web3 can shift power, transform systems and shape better futures. In particular, how the concept of DAOs as purpose driven networks of small autonomous teams can redistribute power, value flows and resources across society at scale.
	- Note - this purpose will evolve as the stakeholder group come onboard and works on purpose and early strategy for the project. 
- ### Cell specific Purpose 
	- The early purpose of this Cell is to help shape up the beginnings of the Reimagining Power project. To design the early structure and tooling for bringing the partners together to start to define and the subsequent evolution of the operational activities of the project. As proposals are passed and initiatives are spun up within the project, the purpose of this Cell will change as will the make-up of its core team and contributors, its practices, etc
- ## Relationship to SB + Stakeholders====
	- This will be defined as the partners come together and the governance of the project takes more shape. 
	- At this early stage the Cell has been created and funded by SuperBenefit (via [this proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/superbenefit.eth/proposal/0xdee77e3d0c41591bec2b880928755295a3bb4658a7950a95a7e954cac6c189c2)) and operates under the umbrella of SuperBenefit's norms and practices. 

# Practice
- ## Organization
	- ### Roles
		- Roles can be documented and visualized in [Sobol](https://sobol.io/d/sb_dao_primitive_cell/explorer/team/b4Khb1nbSL/roles?sideView=table&view=circles).
			- [**Sobol - Reimagining Power Roles**](https://sobol.io/d/sb_dao_primitive_cell/explorer/team/b4Khb1nbSL/roles?sideView=table&view=circles)
		- **Point Person(s)**
			- @Rowan  The point person acts as the primary point of contact for the project.
			- ==Note this is provisional based on getting the project kicked off. The point person will likely change from Rowan as the project evolves. ==
			- [**Sobol - Point Person Role**](https://sobol.io/d/sb_dao_primitive_cell/explorer/role/Qn1cuwJ28h/overview?view=circles)
		- **Core Team**
			- Operational stakeholders who share responsibility for this project's outcomes are referred to the "Core Team". 
			- Initial core team members are:
				- @Rowan

				- @Aditi 
				- @MBaldwin 
				- @Filsan 
				- @heenal 
			- [**Sobol - Core Team Role**](https://sobol.io/d/sb_dao_primitive_cell/explorer/role/XngrXMCGje/overview?view=circles)
		- **Contributor**
			- Contributors who do not hold stake in the project's outcomes, but who accomplish specific tasks related to its goals hold the "contributor" role.
			- Members
				- @keepDRMN
				- @Nate 
			- **[Sobol - Contributor Role](https://sobol.io/d/sb_dao_primitive_cell/explorer/role/xbqSotLCNH/overview?view=circles)**
	- ### Role Badges
		- >Describe and link to the cell's role badges here.
	- ### **Contributor Rewards**
		- > No decisions about how rewards will be earned and distributed have been made yet. Document agreements regarding contributor rewards here.
- ## Coordination
	- ### Communication
		- >Link to or describe the process for creating and changing the meeting schedule here.
		- >Link to and describe the meeting agenda template here.
		- The cell uses the [Check-In Protocol](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/docs/cbf5146b-6d3f-4f75-9e51-0435f4011ed9) to start regular meetings
	- ### Decision-Making
		- The cell uses [The Decider Protocol](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/docs/cbf5146b-6d3f-4f75-9e51-0435f4011ed9) for major decisions. 
		- Major decisions are logged in **[Sobol - Reimagining Power Agreements](https://sobol.io/d/sb_dao_primitive_cell/explorer/team/b4Khb1nbSL/agreements?sideView=table&view=circles)**
		- ### **Resource Allocation**
			- The core team will vote (off-chain) on resource allocation decisions. The team will implement a simple consent based voting system inspired by the _[Core Protocols - Decider Protocol ](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/decider)_
			- Decisions will be logged in the below Decisions Log
			- ==Note ==as the Cell evolves this may change for example if there is some sort of stakeholder budget approval put in place 
		- ### **Other Major Decisions**
			- Other major decisions will be made using the same decision protocol as resource allocation decisions 
	- ## Shared Tools
		- ### **Task Management**
			- Tasks and workstream projects can be tracked using [Clarity group task board](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/group/POW/tasks). Any contributor can add a task to the board to keep important notes and show progress.
			- **[Clarity - Reimagining Power Tasks](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/group/POW/tasks)**
		- ### **Documentation**
			- Working documents and notes related to this project can be recorded in the [Clarity group doc repo](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/group/POW/docs).
			- **[Clarity - Reimagine Power Documents](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/group/POW/docs)**
		- ### **Design Workspace**
			- The current design space and collaborative whiteboard is hosted on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ct2DHgl4NjNEyqOadB13ml/Reimagining-Power---Project-Planning?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=NJLpuR0Z1XKyolVj-1).
