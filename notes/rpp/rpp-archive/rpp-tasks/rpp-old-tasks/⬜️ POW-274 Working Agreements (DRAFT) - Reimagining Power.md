# Current Agreements
- These working agreements are intended to clarify the culture and practices of the Reimagining Power cell. All working agreements currently in effect are recorded here. 
- ## Core Agreements
	- The core agreements are working agreements which apply to all activity within the cell. Some of these may be moved to a different document in the future.
	- ### Membership
		- Participants will be selected on a flexible, opt-in basis and documented in the Cell State.
	- ### Scope of Work
		- The core team will coordinate with Stakeholders to determine achievable goals and KPI's for the project. These will be documented in the Cell State
			- The scope of work for this cell will be limited to tasks which make provable contribution toward the stated goals.
- ## Common Practices
	- ### **Roles**
		- The core team will define the **contributor** role in addition to any other roles needed for the cell to operate.
		- The core team will issue badges to role owners as on-chain proof of role ownership.
		- All roles (including their responsibilities, authorities, eligibility criteria and rewards) will be documented in the cell state.
	- ### Communication
		- Communication agreements apply to activity within the cell's Discord chat, meetings, social media and other communication channels.
		- **Commitments & Working Hours**
			- Members will determine equitable norms for availability, working hours and commitments of time. These will be documented in the cell state.
			- Members are expected to follow relevant conversation topics and reply to direct comms (pings, polls, DMs etc.) within 48 hours.
		- **Meetings**
			- The cell will determine a process for creating and changing the regular meeting schedule. This will be documented in the cell state.
			- The cell will maintain a meeting agenda template and update it collaboratively. A link to the template will be documented in the cell state.
			- The cell will define communication protocols for regular meetings.  These will be documented in the cell state.
		- **Decision Making**
			- The cell will determine processes for **establishing consent** and **reaching consensus** (or at least collective agreement). These will be documented in the cell state.
				- Unless otherwise agreed upon, the default decision making process will be ==consent/consensus==.
			- **Major Decisions**
				- Some important decision areas, called "Major Decisions", require group consensus to be considered valid. These are:
					- Changing the **Working Agreements**
					- **Spending **or interacting with assets owned by the cell
					- Changing the process for reaching consensus on major decisions.
				- Changes to the working agreements must be approved using the **major decision protocol** to be considered valid.
				- A log of all major decisions will be maintained. The location of the log will be documented in the cell state.
	- ### Resource Allocation
		- The core team will decide to spend or interact with assets owned by the cell using the **major decision** protocol.
		- **Contributor Rewards**
			- The core team will decide when, why and how rewards will be earned and distributed for this project.
			- All agreements involving contributor rewards will be documented in the cell state.
		- A log will be maintained of all transactions or interactions with cell-owned assets. The location of the log will be documented in the cell state. 
	- ### Information Management
		- **Task Management**
			- The core team will determine which task management tool is used to track tasks and projects. This will be documented in the cell state.
		- **Documentation**
			- The core team will determine which documentation tool is used to record information related to this project. This will be documented in the cell state. 
			- Full documentation of learnings derived from this project will be published as part of the project deliverables.
- ## Progress Norms
	- ### Operating Rhythm
		- The cell will pace its progress using regular working periods called "Revolutions".
			- Work will be performed during a 2-week "Sprint", once per revolution.
		- The core team will determine the cadence and schedule of Revolutions, plus any planning or reflection periods in between. This will be documented in the Cell State.

# Updates & Iterations

# Source Material
- ## SuperBenefit Proposal
	- **[Original Proposal - Clarity](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/docs/0f06bfeb-052f-4c68-a0ae-c1f514273a46)**
- ## Initial Planning Q&A
	- [ ] **Who are the stakeholders in this project, and how does this cell relate to them?**
		-  All In For Sport, Equality Fund, Reimagine Institute, SuperBenefit, Ontario Trillium Foundation
		- The core team should decide on a procedure for engaging stakeholders in strategic decision-making. This should serve to satisfy the stakeholders' need/desire for involvement to the greatest extend reasonably possible, without interfering with the cell's operational autonomy.
	- [ ] **What are the goals for this project?**
		- Create a playbook to answer questions specific to needs of Stakeholders:
			- What does web3 uniquely enable to shift power and transform systems?
			- What new models does web3 offer for mobilizing and distributing capital toward transformative outcomes?
			- Where might web3 provide the greatest leverage for catalyzing systemic change? 
		- Design proof of concept for partner DAO/DisCo exploration, including framework for community engagement based on Stakeholders' stated needs.
		- Publish Stories, blog posts and other media related to the project.
	- [x] **Who will participate, and what are the requirements to do so?**
		- Participants have been selected on a flexible, opt-in basis and noted in the Cell State
	- [ ] **Why, When and How will rewards be distributed?**
		- Retroactive rewards (denominated in USDC and SPRB) can be paid to contributors upon completion of tasks posted to the Cell's roadmap.
			- Contributions should be reviewed promptly upon completion. If approved, rewards should be disbursed during the "reflection" phase of the same revolution.
		- Pro-rata payments (aka "Retainer Fee") can be issued to role holders in order to secure their minimum expected time for each cycle based on their role.
			- The core team should decide on a base Retainer Fee for each role, and adjust for each revolution if necessary.
			- Commitments should be re-affirmed during the "Planning" phase of each revolution, with payments made before the start of the corresponding sprint.
		- Contributors can decide to create non-monetary rewards (POAP/NFTs, attestations, etc.) as desired to acknowledge & memorialize their contributions.
		- Ad-hoc reimbursements or rewards can be proposed using the default decision-making process.
	- [x] **How will major decisions be made?**
		- Major decisions (such as updating/ratifying the Cell State, modifying roles and updating project goals) can use consent-based decision making as described in the [Decider Protocol](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/decider).
			- Proposals should be posted in a new thread under the #reimagining-power Discord channel with a relevant title added.
	- [ ] **How will decisions to allocate resources be made?**
		- Major resource allocation decisions (such as delegating a large portion of funds to a cycle or significant project) can be made using the major decision protocol.
	- [ ] What roles do we need?
		- [ ] Who will serve as the point person(s)?
			- Rowan will serve as interim point person.
		- [ ] Who will be the Core Team for this project?
			- Core team has been self-selected and noted in the cell state.
	- [x] **How will we pace our work? Will we use sprints?**
		- Work can be paced using "revolutions" consisting of three phases:
			- 1-week Planning Phase
			- 2-week Sprint Phase
			- 1-week Reflection Phase
		- The first revolution can start during the week of August 21st
		- Sprints can be tracked in Clarity
		- [x] **How will meetings be scheduled and conducted?**
			- Meetings can initially be scheduled by polling the #reimagining-power channel in Discord to schedule asynchronously. Can use LettuceMeet or similar tooling.
			- (policy) The cell should agree upon a regular weekly meeting schedule.
