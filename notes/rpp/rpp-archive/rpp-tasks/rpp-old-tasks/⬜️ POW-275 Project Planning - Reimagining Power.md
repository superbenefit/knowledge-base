>This document is for information related to the initial planning of the Reimagining Power project.
## Purpose Statement
- To explore how web3 can shift power, transform systems and shape better futures. In particular, how the concept of DAOs as purpose driven networks of small autonomous teams can redistribute power, value flows and resources across society at scale. 

## Scope of Work

# Project Phases
- ## Design Phase for the DAO Cell Model
	- Purpose and Insight: Transformation Mapping using the Three Horizons Model
	- Community governance: designing the larger community governance mechanism that will wrap the operational structures of the network
	- Operational governance: designing the coordination primitives (including the Cell primitive) that allow the network to form useful and efficient operating structures
	- Resource, Treasury and Capital Model: developing mechanisms for managing the flows of information and resources across the network
	- Governance support: supporting community proposals to drive new activity across the network
	- Operational support: best practice and tooling to help Cells to manage coordination and decision-making across the operational network of Cells
- ## Research & Documentation
	- Documenting the DAO Cell and community governance playbook.
	- Overview of examples of web3 applied toward intentional positive outcomes, including Impact DAOs, crypto philanthropy models, granting and investing mechanisms.
	- Overview of examples where web3 uniquely enables systems level change. 
- ## Prototyping & Iteration Phase
	- Apply the DAO cell model in radical experiments for grassroots and participatory funding and capture the learning, including All In For Sport, Equality Fund and Reimagine Institute.
	- Mobilizing and allocating capital in more equitable and distributed ways: shifting from traditional, donor-centric models of philanthropy to new approaches which center power and decision making in the hands of proximate change makers.
	- Iterating and refining the DAO Cell and community governance framework and toolset so that it can be easily reused and evolved. Open-sourcing all designs so that others can utilize them in similar projects and can extend this work into new areas. 
- ## Sensemaking & Knowledge Sharing
	- Share the learning process through a series of blogs and other storytelling opportunities (examples here).
	- Publish the DAO Cell and Community Governance Playbook under creative commons attribution share-alike license.
- ## Engagement with OTF and other Foundations
	- DAOs and Philanthropy Salon, see concept here.
	- Offer continued web3 adventure tours and learning session(s) (example web3 and systems transformation series).
