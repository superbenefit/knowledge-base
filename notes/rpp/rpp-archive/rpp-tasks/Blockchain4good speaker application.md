_I could apply for a speaking slot to talk about IFP? I wonder if that's premature, though?_

_It might not be quite what they’re looking for in terms of “startups” and “building solutions” but maybe it would pique folks’ interest?_

## Project/Solution Name \* 

The Infinite Front Porch

## Project/Solution Description \* 

In an increasingly digital world, vast reservoirs of human knowledge and wisdom remain untapped because they exist beyond the reach of current technology. The Infinite Front Porch project aims to bridge this gap by creating networks of AI agents that work with human partners to gather, preserve, and share knowledge from traditionally excluded sources. 

By combining emerging AI capabilities with community-owned infrastructure, we are building systems that allow communities to surface and leverage their collected knowledge and wisdom, while retaining ownership and control of their community knowledge assets. 

The project envisions community-run LLMs that access local knowledge libraries and coordinate across a swarm of similar systems. This infrastructure preserves data sovereignty, enables interoperability, and makes previously siloed or excluded knowledge usable and  accessible across networks.

The Infinite Front Porch is being incubated within SuperBenefit, a network DAO that coordinates system-change experiments across web3 and civil society. The project is a partnership between a collective of leading web3 organizations who are each working on knowledge mobilization (including SuperBenefit, Gaia AI, Crypto Commons Association, LabourDAO, and All In For Sport) and traditional non-profit, philanthropic, and government organizations interested in developing decentralized knowledge commons infrastructures.

Our work is guided by a commitment to mutualism, consent, and community sovereignty - serving as connective tissue across domains to build systems for human and ecological thriving.

## Key area of impact? \*

Financial inclusion / sustainable supply chains / climate action / digital identity / general social impact

## How does your project address the challenges under the selected thematic area? \* 

We are entering an era where powerful AI systems are being rapidly deployed without community input, transparency, or accountability. Centralized models concentrate control over data and decision-making, reinforcing existing inequalities and eroding trust. To build just and lasting systems, especially in the domain of social impact, we need infrastructures that centre community agency, preserve privacy, and enable shared governance. Blockchain technology is essential to this - offering the foundations for consentful, distributed, and verifiable systems that can support community-first approaches to AI.

The Infinite Front Porch creates exactly this: a way for communities to build and govern their own AI systems, drawing on local knowledge and values. It enables communities to decide what they share, with whom, and under what terms. By making knowledge interoperable across networks - without giving up sovereignty - it supports the emergence of plural, resilient, and cooperative systems.

This is not a product to scale - it is infrastructure to share, enabling communities to steward their knowledge, participate in distributed decision-making, and contribute to collective transformation on their own terms. 

As more actors across web3 and philanthropy move toward similar principles (e.g. knowledge gardens, playbooks, pattern libraries), the Infinite Front Porch provides the connective tissue needed to turn ideas into working systems - offering practical value across multiple domains of social impact.
