# **Implementation Plan for the ICS Experiment**

## **Purpose**

This plan outlines the execution of the ICS experiment within the Reimagining Power Project (RPP). It includes governance setup, impact measurement through hypercerts, the launch of a Green Pill Network (GPN) local chapter, and an onboarding process for contributors. The goal is to establish decentralized governance mechanisms, document impact, and build community engagement.

This document provides clear action items, assigned responsibilities, and timelines to ensure the successful implementation of the ICS experiment. It serves as a working reference for all involved stakeholders, ensuring alignment, transparency, and accountability.

## **Key Activities & Timelines**

### **1. Governance Infrastructure Setup**

**Objective:** Implement decentralized governance tools to enhance decision-making and transparency for ICS.

**Rationale:** A robust governance framework is crucial for ICS to operate efficiently, allocate resources transparently, and engage contributors effectively. The implementation of decentralized tools ensures that decision-making is distributed and accountable, reducing reliance on traditional hierarchical models.

**Key Actions:**

- [x] Set up an ICS multisig wallet to manage treasury funds securely. 

- [x] Establish an Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain to improve ICSâ€™s on-chain identity.

- [x] Map out desired governance structure - 2

- [x] Codify governance roles using Hats Protocol - 2

- [x] ?? Configure a Snapshot space for decentralized, token-based voting - 2 ??

- [x] Launch an ICS CharmVerse space for documentation and collaboration. - 2

- [ ] Integrate ICS into SuperBenefitâ€™s on-chain accounting system for transparent financial reporting - 2

- [x] Create a Cell State document outlining governance structure, decision-making processes, and responsibilities - 4

- [ ] 12-14 hrs

**Timeline:**
ðŸ“… **Completion by** **MARCH 2025**
ðŸ‘¤ **Lead:** RPP (technical setup) & ICS (operational adoption)

**Dependencies & Risks:**

- ICS needs to decide on desired structure, including how different programs and Green Pill London fit in

- Coordination between ICS and RPP on tool selection and setup.

- Ensuring sufficient ICS contributors are onboarded and trained to use governance tools.

### **2. Minting a Hypercert for the Repair CafÃ©**

**Objective:** Use blockchain-based hypercerts to document the environmental and social impact of the Repair CafÃ©.

**Rationale:** Impact documentation is a key component of funding and sustainability in regenerative ecosystems. By minting a hypercert, ICS can transparently verify and communicate the value generated by its Repair CafÃ© initiative, opening up potential future funding opportunities.

**Key Actions:**

- [ ] Gather supporting data from Repair CafÃ© participants, volunteers, and impact reports - 2

- [ ] Develop hypercert structure and metadata - decide what info to include and what to leave out - 2

- [ ] Guide ICS in minting the hypercert - 4

- [ ] Guide ICS in issuing attestations via Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)  - 4

- [ ] Publicize the attestations to stakeholders, donors, and ReFi communities to promote awareness - 4

- [ ] 16 hours- - - ???

**Timeline:**
ðŸ“… **Completion by** **APRIL 2025**
ðŸ‘¤ **Lead:** RPP (design & technical support) & ICS (data collection & minting)

**Dependencies & Risks:**

- Data collection process needs to be structured and verified to ensure integrity.

- Technical challenges in minting Hypercerts

- Sufficient engagement from community members issuing attestations

- Adoption and engagement from potential funders and stakeholders.

### **3. Green Pill Network Local Chapter Launch**

**Objective:** Establish a recognized Green Pill Network chapter in London, ON.

**Rationale:** The Green Pill Network (GPN) is an ecosystem of regenerative Web3 initiatives. Creating a local chapter in London, ON will help ICS connect with a broader network of aligned communities and resources while building a regenerative local economy.

**Key Actions:**

- [x] Submit a chapter application with support from GPN stewards to ensure fast-track approval.

- [ ] ~~Assess whether nesting the chapter under SuperBenefit is the right approach -~~ (SB is a node in the mycelial network)

- [ ] Set up a multisig wallet for the chapter.???

- [ ] Set up governance structure for the chapter (ICS, AIFS, SB) - 4

- [ ] Continue outreach at London community events and build partnerships with local organizations, tech businesses, and sustainability-focused initiatives.

- [ ] Organize and host the first chapter meeting - Apr - goal 10 people - 4 

- [ ] 15-20 hrs

**Timeline:**
ðŸ“… **First chapter meeting by** **MAY 2025**
ðŸ‘¤ **Lead:** ICS (hosting & outreach) & RPP (governance design & application support)

**Dependencies & Risks:**

- Alignment with SuperBenefit on how the chapter is structured and governed.

- Building strong relationships with GPN leadership for endorsement and fast-tracking.

- Ensuring adequate local participation to sustain chapter momentum.

### **4. Onboarding Contributors to Web3**

**Objective:** Reduce barriers to Web3 participation and equip contributors with relevant skills.

**Rationale:** Effective onboarding is crucial for ensuring that new contributors understand and feel comfortable engaging with decentralized governance, Web3 tools, and the broader ICS mission. A structured onboarding process ensures a more inclusive and participatory ecosystem.

**Key Actions:**

- [ ] Discover what onboarding resources already exist that we can adapt and learn from - 2

- [ ] Identify key topics to cover (and what to leave out) - 2

- [ ] Develop onboarding materials (content, slideshow, etc) - 2

- [ ] Pilot the workshop with initial participants and gather structured feedback. - 4

- [ ] Provide additional technical training on wallets, governance platforms, and CharmVerse. ??? - next phase

- [ ] Iterate based on participant input to refine the onboarding flow and documentation. ??? - next phase

- [ ] 12 hours

**Timeline:**
ðŸ“… **Pilot workshop by March 2025**
ðŸ‘¤ **Lead:** RPP (workshop design & facilitation) & ICS (community outreach & iteration)

**Dependencies & Risks:**

- Ensuring Web3 tools are accessible and user-friendly for non-technical contributors.

- Gathering relevant feedback to iterate and improve onboarding sessions.

- Sustaining engagement from onboarding participants.

---

## **Progress Tracking & Reporting**

- **Tracking System:** Progress will be tracked on CharmVerse.

- **Meetings:** Updates will be provided in OS Stewards meetings.

- **Completion Metrics:**

  - Governance systems are live, with at least three ICS participants actively using them.

  - At least one Hypercert for the Repair CafÃ© is minted and publicized.

  - First GPN chapter meeting is successfully hosted

    - APRIL 

  - Onboarding workshop is completed and iterated based on feedback.

---

## **Conclusion**

This operational plan ensures structured implementation, clear responsibilities, and defined milestones for the ICS experiment within RPP. By focusing on governance, impact measurement, community building, and onboarding, this initiative lays the foundation for a more resilient, transparent, and engaged ICS ecosystem.
