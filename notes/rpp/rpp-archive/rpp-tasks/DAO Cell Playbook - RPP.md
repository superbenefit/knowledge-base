# Purpose

`The purpose of this work as it relates to the RP project.`

The RPP Stakeholders are interested in experiments in reimagining philanthropy by applying web3 principles and practices. To make this kind of exploration and experimentation possible we need a simple framework for creating and coordinating people and organizations in these non-traditional organizational patterns. 

As part of superBenefit's ongoing work, we have been developing such a framework. We have created a set of organizational and technical primitives for creating and coordinating "purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams". We describe these collectively as the DAO Primitives. "DAO" describing the larger network, and "Cells" describing the small autonomous teams that make up a DAO's operational structure.  

Our stakeholders need an easily accessible toolkit to apply the DAO primitives framework to design and impediment web3 enabled organizational forms.  

## Expected Outputs / Goals

`The deliverables or outcomes needed from this work`

To help our stakeholders, their network peers and the wider social impact space understand and use these ideas/tools, we must make a playbook to convey all of the relevant information in an accessible manner. These Playbooks will contain **patterns**, which are separate documents focusing on a specific solution space. The playbook will help the reader understand how patterns relating to the DAO primitives framework may be useful to them within the given context.

- DAO Cell Playbook

  - Core Patterns

    - Related Primitives

    - Case Studies

  - Lexicon Entries

  - Case Studies

## Scope of Work

`What will this work cover? What domains of activity are involved?`

- Planning the playbook and its content

- Creating draft content for the playbook

  - Create content for patterns, case studies, etc

  - Component review, collab and substantive editing

  - Playbook composition & copy editing

- Assembling / proofing the playbook and related assets

### Exclusions

`What will this work not cover? What will be excluded from this workstream?`

- Coordinating the high-level content requirements for the playbook (core pattern selection, house style, etc)

- Publishing the playbook outside of the knowledge garden (to print, pdf, etc.) and related design requirements

# Practice

## Contributors

`Who may be interested in contributing to this work?`

**Playbook Contributors** work on playbooks and related deliverables. Contributors may propose and/or claim playbook tasks, and are responsible for setting norms related to the production of deliverables.

- All contributors may join the playbook cell and receive 1 vote by making a proposal to the cell. 

  -  Contributors who don't intend to do any more work in the cell should quit. Quitting will not effect your eligibility for future retrospective rewards (if any).

- You don't need to join the cell to work on contributors and receive bounties. If there is an open bounty you'd like to fulfill as a solo merc, just ask a steward to assign you the task.

  - You may need to share some parts of the task with the steward if you're not in the workgroup, since you'll likely be missing some crucial context. It may be easier to just join the group.

**Playbook Stewards** provide coordination and support functions for playbook contributors, like task management, budgeting, payments, etc.. Stewards are able to transact RPP's playbook loot and vote as delegates of the core team. 

- Stewards work on playbooks as contributors. You can ask them for help with deliverables or anything else.

- Stewards can create, propose and payout rewards for tasks. The easiest way to get a task and get paid is to talk to a steward.

  - Stewards have a lot of delegated voting weight and access to RPP's loot, so they can make (or break) quorum on proposals. Ask a steward if you need help sponsoring or passing one.

  - They don't have any special privileges in the cell though, so you'll still need to talk with your teammates to make collective decisions about working agreements. Stewards won't vote for an unpopular or surprise proposal (and might vote against it).

  - Stewards _can_ ragequit the core team's loot in the case of a malicious proposal. This will cause the proposal to fail and seriously harsh the vibe, so don't do submit bad proposals.

**RPP Core Team** (facilitated by stewards) are responsible for aligning the high-level content plan with the needs of the Reimagining Power project and communicating with external stakeholders.

- Core Team members work on deliverables and are encouraged to participate as contributors if they have the capacity to do so.

- By default, core team votes sit in the RPP safe and are delegated to a steward (Rowan).

## Resources

`What resources may be needed for this work?`

- **Playbooks Cell**

  - Operational governance of the playbooks workgroup will be conducted by the playbooks cell, which has the following resources available

    - [Governance Contract](https://admin.daohaus.club/#/molochv3/0xa/0xe80ffca045bf338cb088b8fb635130431ec6f976)

    - #rp-playbooks Discord channel

    - [Charmverse task board](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/playbooks-rpp-7896050492098612)

- Playbooks Budget

  - Work on playbooks is funded using Playbook Loot, which is backed 1:1 with USDC in the playbooks treasury

  - Unspent playbook loot is held in the RP Treasury. Stewards and core team members can transact playbook loot

- [Knowledge Base](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base)

  - Deliverables from this project will be recorded in the knowledge base, which is a Quartz vault hosted on GitHub.

  - Contributors can use the vault to compose playbooks.

## Information and Transparency

`What do you need to manage information related to this work in a transparent way?`

- All working agreements, recommended practices and other important information is stored in the [cell state document](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/playbooks-rpp-7896050492098612).

- All information related to votes, treasury funds and other governance matters are held in the [governor interface](https://admin.daohaus.club/#/molochv3/0xa/0xe80ffca045bf338cb088b8fb635130431ec6f976).

- All outputs and related content is stored in the [knowledge base](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base).

These resources are visible to all SuperBenefit members and can be inspected at any time. To modify the content of these documents, post a thread in the #rp-playbooks channel on Discord. A steward will assist if a proposal or other governance action is needed.

# Progress

## Work Items

- Working documents can be stored in Charmverse for collaborative editing. Workers can compose content wherever they want.

- Outputs are recorded in the knowledge base. If you have a finished output to record, you can do it yourself or ask a steward for help.

### Content Outline

```


Building purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams using Web3 patterns and primitives. 
- "Purpose aligned" - community governed networks that can steer themselves towards achieving a longterm purpose
- "Small autonomous teams" - operational networks that harness small group autonomy to produce scalable action in complex environments.

A framework that allows for the granular design of new organizational types, and for the scalable repeatable implementation of types that work. 

Organizational types that reimagine power relationships, ownership and resource allocation methods. That promote collective intelligence sourced from the margins of the networks. That integrate the deep logic of longterm thinking with reflexive creativity emerging from where the work is being done.

The DAO Primitives framework helps you design a functioning organizational structure, based on refined patterns and primitives that can evolve as your network grows in size and complexity.

## Context & Orientation

- This section helps the reader understand the DAO Cell framework and its uses, benefits, etc.
- Cells and some other components included in this playbooks are also patterns, so this content can be derived from those documents (if they already exist)
	- If a pattern doesn't exist yet, coordinate with the Community Governance stream to create it.
- This is somewhat strategic for SuperBenefit, so Stewards will probably do this part in collaboration with stakeholders.

# The DAO Cell Playbook

How to use the DAO primitives framework to compose web3 enabled purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams.

## Overview

This playbook is for people and organizations wanting to build a new organization/network or adapt an existing one based on principles of decentralized governance and leverage the DAO primitives framework to do this. 

This playbook covers: 

1. DAO Primitives framework - a set of organizational primitives that can be used to understand and design decentralized organizations based on the concept of purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams. 

2. A core set of 3 patterns for implementing different aspects of this framework across 3 functional areas; community governance, operational governance and multi-stakeholder governance

3. Guides for you to follow for each pattern to work through how to compose together versions of the primitives into a coherent community organizational structure. Including organizational design and technical implementation.

We recommend that you read through the introductory sections of the playbook so that you have a firm understanding of the DAO primitives framework, the organizational design principles that underpin its different elements and how they are designed to be combined together to achieve a coherent whole. 

Then work through each pattern utilizing the implementation guides to design your governance and operational systems. We also recommend that you reach out to the SuperBenefit community for help and guidance as you do this. Organizational design is complex and having an experienced facilitator to help can make this complex process much simpler.  

## Context & Orientation

### Introduction 

- Crypto primitives give us the opportunity to fundamentally redesign organizational and financial models in ways that are better for individuals and for societies. This opportunity to reimagine organizations brings with it complexity, as structures and practices that were once fixed become flexible and adaptable. As a result we need to lean on primitives, and patterns for combining these primitives, that we can use to reliably produce organizational structures with the features we want. 
 
 This playbook outlines a set of primitives, patterns with which to combine these primitives, and technical modules with which to implement them. It is designed for people wanting to design a DAO type structure around the concept of DAOs as purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams. 
 

**Why the DAO primitives framework** 

For new organizational structures to leverage the opportunity that is in front of us, they need to leverage and balance 2 different and often competing organizational dynamics. 

1. Autonomy - firstly they need to allow for teams to have enough autonomy to leverage small team collaborative dynamics, where people have enough ownership and control to feel genuinely engaged, the freedom to steer their work where they think the most value can be generated. 

2. Structure - secondly, there needs to be enough shared structure and practices for this collection of small autonomous teams to aggregate up into a coherent purpose driven network. A network that is more collectively intelligent than traditional organizations but also harnesses the benefits of scale. 

Balancing the competing tensions of autonomy vs structure is critical to creating new organizational types that can move society forward. We need to liberate people from authoritarian and bureaucratic management hierarchies while not casting them into the tyranny of structurelessness. We also need to design adaptive structures that can flexibly change as the complex needs of an organization/network evolve. 



## DAO Primitives 

- **Overview of the DAO primitives framework**. 

  - Layout how the 3 functions of community governance, operational governance and multi-stakeholder governance fit together inside the DAO primitives framework. This should be reasonably straightforward based on the fact that the framework is already mostly laid out in obsidian already and can just be referenced.

- **Framework** 

  - Phase

  - Scale

  - State  

  - Ref core documents that explain the primitives framework

    - DAO primitives framework docs in Obsidian

    - 

- **Patterns and their relationships** 

  - How the framework translates into the 3 different Patterns

  - Introducing the concepts of

    - Community and operational governance as a way to implement the DAO primitives framework

    - DAOs as community networks 

    - Cells as operational units

    - **Community governance** - a constituency scale structure that holds and directs the longterm purpose and goals of a community - with phase and state

    - **Operational governance** - a coordination and collaboration scale network that executes on the purpose and goals of the community - with phase and state

    - **Multi-stakeholder governance** - network scale partnerships between different community networks and organizations - with phase and state

  - Lean on existing docs and diagrams to lay out how all of the these pieces fit together into a coherent set of patterns out of which many different decentralized organizational structures can be built.

# 1. Community Governance Pattern 

**_What are the core dynamics / qualities that we are trying to design into community governance? What makes it special and interesting and different, and what makes it only possible now, with web3 tooling?_**

**_Lets lay these dynamics out as the important ways that community governance can work. This will be the backdrop to an facilitation guide for creating a specific community governance structure using the DAO primitives framework_** 

**High-level** - the DAO primitives is structured around a model of a community governance that wraps an operational structure, built out of a network of Cells. The operational structure can then become the connective tissue through which the DAO can connect with other DAOs/communities/networks and form larger network scale partnerships. 

There are many many ways of thinking about how you might implement the community governance structure. The best governance structure for a particular community will depend highly on the context of that particular community.

## 4. Implementation

### Implementation Guide - creating a community governance structure

How to create a community governance infrastructure that can wrap a purpose aligned network of small autonomous teams. Note - "DAO" is a placeholder for any decentralized governance structure.

The goal of the community governance structure is to provide a foundational structure to guide and support the operational structure which will execute on the goals of the community 

Referencing DAO primitive framework docs to understand how CG fits together with other structures 

### Community governance minimum viable functions 

_Note - lets create a list of the fundamental functions/features that a community governance needs to function effectively. This can form the basis for designing a community governance structure (and picking a model/pattern e.g bioregional something, a local hub & node model etc)_

1. Funding/economic system - a community governance system needs resourcing to maintain its activities. Examples could be - returns from an endowment, a fee or honorarium from projects the community is supporting, the sale of or yield from network tokens, protocol fees etc

2. Decision mechanisms - the community needs scale appropriate decision-making mechanisms and policies to govern these. e.g proposal process, voting process, delegation system etc

3. Coordination infrastructure - comms platforms, role/permissions management, knowledge management, community engagement infrastructure etc

4. Technical infrastructure to implement the governance design. This includes trust mechanisms to ensure that community participation is fair and decisions are representative.

5. Treasury - a way to store, manage and distribute the resources of the community

6. Security mechanisms - systems to combat governance attacks (and other forms of attack). E.g a security council or other governance backstop.  

7. State - a set of documents that capture and store key information about the community

  - The community's purpose,  principles, values, goals etc. What the community wants to achieve and how it wants to go about achieving it.  

  - A set of Core agreements, practices and policies about how the community is governed and operates. 

  - The community's activities, decisions and other records.

1. Operational capability/capacity - in the case of applying the DAO primitives framework this ability to execute on activities will take the form of an operational governance structure (see Operational Governance Pattern). But it could just as easily be another form of operational structure which would provide a different set of features and risks.

**Questions to ask**

- What is the community trying to achieve? What's its vision for itself, its purpose and high-level goals? 

- What is the nature of the community? Is it based in a local bio-region? Is it globally distributed? Does it already have an existing membership base etc

- What activities will the community engage in or support? I.e what is it primarily being set up to do?

- What is the principled approach to how the community wants to organize and govern itself? There are many ways a community can be governed. 

- What is the phase of development of the community. E.g is it already a functioning community looking to transition some of its governance structure? Is it a small group of people looking to establish/engage a new community? etc 

- Scale - what scales is the governance going to operate at? E.g are there small collaboration scale groups responsible for activities or decisions? Is there a large constituency scale community participating in decision-making?

## Community Governance Facilitation Template 

  - Build on the minimum viable community governance template to make a template. To design a Community Governance State doc as the place to hold the the design of the community governance model. 

  - Community governance state template

    - Purpose

      - Purpose/problem

      - Genesis of the network

      - Goals

      - Design/intentions

    - Practice 

      - Network structure

      - Legal structure

      - Governance systems

      - Policy and other community agreements

      - Treasury management

    - Progress



**Technical modules for implementation (match tooling to the minimum viable GC functions list/template)**

  - Documentation 

    - DAO state, Cell state - github/book, charmeverse, notion etc

    - Other document repositories - charmeverse, google docs etc

    - DAO structure visualization - sobol, ?

    - Community comms platform - discord, telegram etc

    - Decision-making platforms - snapshot, commonwealth, charmeverse, discourse etc

    - Treasury management - safe, den, etc

    - Legal structure consideration and examples - UNA, DUNA, LLC, Marshall islands etc

# 2. Operational Governance Pattern

**_What are the core dynamics / qualities that we are trying to design into community governance? What makes it special and interesting and different, and what makes it only possible now, with web3 tooling?_**

**_Lets lay these dynamics out as the important ways that community governance can work. This will be the backdrop to an facilitation guide for creating a specific community governance structure using the DAO primitives framework_** 

The overarching pattern we are describing as _purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams_ has a version of community governance (see the Community Governance pattern and the community governance implementation facilitation guide for how to think about and design community governance structures), that wraps an operational governance structure that executes on the the activities of the network. 

What this overarching pattern promotes is implementing new forms of governance that are only becoming practical because of web3 technical primitives. Traditional business, charitable and governmental structures are generally run as top-down hierarchies where a few people hold all the power etc etc

The invention of digital cryptographic primitives combined with rapid experimentation on how to use these to underpin new ways of organizing and aligning people are creating new opportunities to collaborate and coordinate better. Opportunities to build fairer systems that respect the people that participate in them, that can more intelligently direct their actions towards things that improve the state of the world and the people participating in these systems. 

Operational structures tend to be created as rigid hierarchies that are "managed" on behalf of capital holders. This creates liner decision flows, rigid rule-sets and strong focus on extracting more and more efficiency. As a result these operational structures tend to become fixed and static squandering the the creativity and intelligence latent in the people they employ. 

The goal of developing operational structure using crypto primitives to create purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams is to create structure that can leverage many of the new dynamics that come out of cutting edge organizational design, complexity science but also recognizes that humans have always sought to collaborate and coordinate in powerful and healthy ways, and that many of these tendencies have been denied to us by the rigid business structures that the world has been obsessed with for the past couple of hundred years.

**Things/features/concepts that are fundamental to this notion of purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams (DAOs) build on crypto primitives**

**Decentralized decision-making/governance** - including progressive decentralization

**Fractal scaling** - properties of living systems

**Permissionless access and innovation**

**Transparency** - things are open by default and only closed/hidden as needed, not the other way around

**Autonomy** - individuals and small group autonomy is the source of collective intelligence. If they can choose to move towards the ideas and opportunities that are most valuable to them, then a system can organically orient towards valuable activities.  

**Networks** - harnessing the power of networks and network effects in powerful ways that can supersede traditional business models

**Flexibility** - composable primitives that can be used to create structures that work at the different scales and phases of organization. Rather than a one-size-fits-all model, a compose-the-right-structure-for-your-needs model

**Collective/network intelligence**

**Evolving adapting systems** - properties of living systems

**Regenerative economics**

**Web3 infrastructure** - smart contract, token based governance, blockchain based transparency and security

**System level impact** - networks that have the flexibility to operate at multiple points across an impact domain and coordinate with other organizations and networks to have deep long-term impact. 

The operational governance patten is designed to be used to implement a governance mechanism based purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams using the DAO primitives framework. This kind of operational network is designed to be wrapped by a community governance structure that will hold the purpose and high-level goals that an operational governance structure will execute towards.
