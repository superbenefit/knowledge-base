# Purpose

`The purpose of this work as it relates to the RP project.`

The Purpose of the Philanthropy workstream is to create a collaborative space to reimagine power and shift mindsets to transform capital and philanthropy practices. This includes mobilizing all forms of capital - technological, social, financial, narrative, (political) and cultural capital.

## Expected Outputs / Goals

`The deliverables or outcomes needed from this work`

**Insightful Dialogues/Philanthropy Salons:** initiate discussions and presentations to introduce blockchain, DAOs, and web3 technologies to philanthropic ands social impact organizations. Create a networked approach to explore how we reimagine power.

**Building Trusted relationships:** for co-learning, courageous conversations and peer support we will mobilize the decentralized and collective wisdom and action to transform capital and philanthropy and social impact practices by leveraging web3 technologies.

**Equity & Sovereignty:** to collectively understand the historical roots of philanthropy, traditional power structures and the colonial practices within philanthropy and social impact. And to identify and test new practices that center the voices and decision making with equity and Indigenous communities.
