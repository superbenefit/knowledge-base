**Migration of tasks and related information from Clarity to Charmverse.**

>  has been merged into this task.

# Purpose

_Much of SuperBenefit's task management information is stored in [Clarity](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit). Because Clarity will be shutting down at some point in the future, this information must be moved to another platform._ 

We've chosen Charmverse as our new operational info mgmt platform and are using its Pages and Database features to store/organize new and ongoing work. Tasks and procedures still stored in Clarity must be moved to Charmverse in order to include historical information and reduce context-switching in workflows.

This task will migrate all relevant tasks from Clarity to Charmverse, and establish purpose-built 

---

# Practices

This task will be carried out by  on behalf of the DAO Primitives cell, partially based on content created by .

The DAO Primitives Core Team will be accountable for the output of this task to the WREEP and Reimagining Power cells. The core team will also be accountable to the SB General Circle for ensuring that these outputs are suitable for DAO-wide coordination and the creation of new community squads and operational cells.

## Task Databases

A single  is used to replicate the utility of a dedicated task management tool. This enables a DAO-wide view of current, ongoing and historical activity with filtered views available for cell or workstream specific interfaces.

A single  is used to capture ad-hoc contributions and work performed for Tasks with a market value greater than the [Reward](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/rewards) assigned.

### Views

Filtered database views are used to display and manage tasks within cell and workstream workspaces. Views allow contributors to specific workstreams to track and manage only the tasks which are relevant available to their work, providing a focused view which can useful for collaborative task and project management.

Teams can customize their task database views to suit their needs without interfering with other groups' work. Task authors can optionally choose to hide tasks from views outside of their workspace, reducing spam and providing a nominal level of privacy.

### Descriptions

Database descriptions are used to house important information related to the database and its use.

Descriptions will be pre-populated with basic instructions to help contributors create and manage tasks in the database. Contributors can add or update instructions as needed.

### Templates

Reusable templates are available to help contributors quickly create preformatted tasks based on pre-defined choices. Templates for common tasks will be added as the need arises.

## Procedure Updates

Existing task management procedures were created with Clarity's opinionated task management system in mind. They must be updated to work with Charmverse's more flexible task management tools.

### **Methodology**

In general, procedure recommendations are meant to serve as guidelines to help cells and contributors make use of the shared operational databases and create workflows and rulesets which work best for their projects.

The only hard "rules" for task management are enabling constraints which ensure that the database remains functional and useful for all cells and contributors. Groups are free to define their own task management procedures or adopt/adapt the default procedures used by SuperBenefit Operations.

Suggested initial processes for managing tasks and in-kind contributions in the Reimagining Power project will be created and documented in the database descriptions, along with instructions and walkthroughs for the task management process.

## Documentation

Useful information related to task databases are included or linked directly in the database description. There is no other repository of task management documentation at the time of writing.

Tutorials and helpful links are included wherever feasible, especially where procedures are documented and where users will be required to interact with an advanced Charmverse feature (such as Rewards or Permissions). To avoid delays in the completion of this task and enhance accuracy of instructions, most tutorials will be added after completion of this task as they are requested or as time allows.

# Progress Tracking

Since this is a migration task, progress will be tracked in the target platform. (specifically the ).

Users of the task database (including cells) will be notified as features are made available and will be provided with process documentation, user manual links and tutorials as needed. All feedback and requests will be accommodated to if feasible.

## Key Deliverables

## Work In Progress

- [x] Import task mgmt content from Clarity

- [x] Prepare Destination Pages

- [x] Populate Destination Pages

- [x] Cleanup Task & Project stubs

- [x] Document initial task & contribution processes for  , ,  

- [x] Create general instructions & Loom walkthroughs for basic RP task mgmt operations.

## Task Review

The task will be marked "In Review" when the Task database and related views are fully populated with all relevant work items, procedures and links. Once in review, the deliverable outputs of this task will be presented to participating cells for approval. Feedback and requests from cells will be integrated if feasible to do so.

## Completion

Since this is a multi-cell coordination task assigned to the DAO Primitives cell, its core team will determine when the task will be marked complete in the database _after_ all cells have approved its deliverables.

NotesOriginal TM design (Clarity)https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/work/POW-292Here is an outline of a task management and compensation flow for a Cell to manage core team tasks.This is designed to be simple enough to be easily adopted by projects that SuperBenefit is spinning up (RPP & WREEP). It is assumed that this would be implemented using Tasks in Clarity.OverviewThe Core team of the Cell is responsible for defining and managing the Cell's tasks as part of its operational function.Tasks follow a simple template that captures the key information about a task including who is responsible for the task and what compensation is assigned to the completion of the task.Tasks are managed through a task board from creation through to completionOnce completed tasks are reviewed by the core team compensation can be awardedTask Creation	Tasks can be created in two different ways:Tasks can come out of core team meetings as next steps for the project.Tasks can be proposed by individual core team members (or a group of them), raising them as proposed next steps, or as things that they specifically need to have done. 	Note - thirdly, sub-tasks can be created within a specific task but these are managed by the task owner and not via this core team processTask template	Note - this template is designed to be used for external contributor task as well as for core team tasks. For a core team task (because of trust and high context) the task will be simple and fast to create, but if used for an external contributor it would likely contain a lot more detail. - - Task name:Task outline:Purpose - what are the goals, outcomes or outputs that the task is trying to achieve and how does this reflect the goals of the Cell. Practice - who is responsible for the task? Plus any other details that relate to the "how" of the task, including how the task will be rewarded - tokens, compensation etcProgress - When is the task due and what does Done look like?Approved - who approved the task for execution and when?Complete - when and by whom was the task reviewed and marked it as done?Task managementNote - this simple task management process is designed for a Cell's core team to manage their tasks. If this is being used for managing large numbers of external contributors to the Cell then some additional steps will need to be added, or an entirely different process designed, depending on what was needed.Note - the core team uses a kanban board for task management, with columns to manage task through their lifecycle. Something like: In-development, Proposed, To-do, Doing, Review and Done.Note - the person/s responsible for a task can choose to allocate compensation to others as they see fit. This allows for task owners to engage contributors to perform subtasks as needed.As part of their team meeting the core team:Assigns tasks:Reviews tasks in Proposed Agrees on an assigned compensation for each taskPrioritises and makes decisions on which tasks to approve for executionProvides on-going support - discusses ongoing tasks as needed. People who are responsible for tasks can bring issues to the team and the team can amend timelines, compensation etc as neededReviews tasks - tasks in the Review column are reviewed (outcomes/outputs) and marked as Complete (if complete) and moved to DoneAuthorises compensation - as agreed for completed tasks
