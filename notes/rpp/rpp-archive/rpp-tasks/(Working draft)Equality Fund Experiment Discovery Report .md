# Summary

This report outlines key insights from the discovery phase of the partnership between the Reimagining Power project team and Equality Fund. It maps aspects of Equality Fund's existing grant process, identifies opportunities for innovation using web3 concepts and tools, and suggests possible directions for experimentation. The report will also outline some of the high potential opportunities that are not yet practical to be considered for an initial experiment, but that could be future innovation opportunities for Equality Fund to explore.     

This report is not intended to be an exhaustive analysis of either Equality Fund's processes or the possible opportunities for experimentation. Rather, it captures the shared learnings from our initial discovery phase to support collaborative exploration of practical and implementable experiments.

**Background context** 

**Framing** - Equality Fund is partnering with Super Benefit to explore using web3 tools to innovate on its global feminist grant-making through the Reimagining Power Project. The goal is to explore how web3 patterns and practices could help Equality Fund to evolve its grant-making processes in ways that prioritise promoting: collective power, community accountability, trust at scale, distributed ownership and feminist futures. 

Significant thinking has already gone into the concept of Equality Fund implementing a DISCO. Exploring potentially useful web3 patterns (through this discovery process) is designed to uncover practical opportunities to move in this direction based on experimenting within Equality Fund's current grant processes. 

The RPP is focused on the Prepare funding stream which manages CAD 7 million across four categories and selects 6-7 grants from approximately 1,000 applications, with grants starting January 1, 2025. 

**Current Grant-making Process** - The current grant-making process comprises of several stages, that starts with a broad pool of approximately 1,000 applications that are systematically narrowed down to 6-7 final recipients. This progression involves as set of features and functions including: an advisory body, EF staff contributions, collaborative decision-making through “rumbles,” varying criteria at each stage of the process, comprehensive reference and background checks, final approval by the CEO, and detailed grant agreements with recipients. 

These key features and functions serve as surface areas upon which to explore possible opportunities to leverage web3 patterns and practices to reimagine aspects of Equality Funds grant-making process.

## 

**Areas of Exploration** 

As we delved into Equality Fund's current grant-making process and taking our lead from Sue, we formulated several design questions that explore the different aspects of the current process that may be ripe to be reimagined with a web3 lens. We leant on the anticapture framework to label the different aspects of the process and framed the design questions across:

1. Evaluate - the ways in which applications are sought, sorted and evaluated for eligibility

2. Propose - the ways in which recommendations about applicant selection are made and handled within the process 

3. Decide - the ways in which final decisions are made

4. Execute - the ways in which the logistics of the process are managed

5. Beyond - potential opportunities to reimagine the process beyond the specific features and functions of the existing grant-making process. 

**Possible Directions** 

There are several general areas we have identified were web3 patterns and practices could have profound impacts on grant-making in general and Equality Fund specifically. In this discovery process we identified several trends that we think are not yet ready for practical experimentation in the context of the RPP but are definitely worth exploring as the technology and best practice around these patterns evolve. We identified two patterns that we think are worthy of exploring with the intent of developing a practical experiment that can be executed as part of the RPP. 

1. Evaluate 


1. Data management using open protocols

2. **Privacy-****p****reserving** **e****ligibility** **v****erification**

3. Impact attestations for accountability


1. Propose / Decide


1. Decentralised applicant selection:

2. Reputation-based decision-making:


1. Execute


1. Crypto-based funds disbursement

2. Small autonomous teams working on assessment


1. Beyond


1. Decentralised knowledge sharing platform

2. A fully decentralised funding process

**Suggested patterns**

Based on our perceptions of the combination of the current state of Equality Fund's grant-making process, and the usability and best practice of web3 technology at this point in time, we believe that there are two high-potential directions to explore the design of an experiment. These are:

1. Explore the possibility of a crypto-based mechanism for funds disbursement 

2. Explore creating some sort of onchain decision-making/reputation scoring prototype


**Next steps**

RP contributors will work closely with Sue to work through the above possible directions to narrow in on a direction and an experiment that can be run to explore it. Then we'll collectively develop a scoping document and create a proposal to put to the RP core team for approval. This proposal will include the scope for the experiment as well as a budget, timelines etc. Following this, a team of contributors from the SuperBenefit network, and ideally team members of the Equality Fund will execute on the experiment.

# Background context

**Framing**

1. Equality Fund distributes significant amounts of funding across many different global regions supporting a large number of feminist organisations. Equality Fund and Super Benefit are partnering via the Reimagining Power Project to explore how the emerging tools and practices of web3 might be used to innovate on their existing grant making systems to create better outcomes.

2. The goal is to explore how web3 patterns and practices could help Equality Fund to evolve its grant-making processes in ways that prioritise promoting: collective power, community accountability, trust at scale, distributed ownership and feminist futures. 

3. The area of Equality Fund's granting system that we will be exploring is the _Prepare_ funding stream which sits across 4 grant making categories; Visionary Capacity, Warning Systems, Political Building and Narrative Change. This process manages CAD 7m, where \~1000 applications are narrowed down to 6-7 grants of approximately CAD 1m each. The grant round launched June 28 2024, currently (as of Sept 2024) shortlisted orgs are submitting advanced applications and grants will begin on Jan 1 2025.

4. There is currently little exposure to web3 within the Equality Fund, and a fair amount of scepticism about it. As a result the RPP team will focus on collaborating with Sue Snider (from Equality Fund) to explore the possible directions that an experiment could take. We will aim to engage other people (and potentially other resources) from Equality Fund where there is a clearer idea of the experiment, how to present it and how others might be involved.

5. It would be easy to spend time and resources going broad and exploring many emerging possibilities, but Equality Fund (via Sue) has a desire to narrow quickly to something concrete that can be delivered on. We will aim to move toward a narrowly-scoped, but deep and impactful (if small) experiment.

**The current grant process follows these steps:**

From a wider pool of \~1000 applications (responses from an [EOI](https://equalityfund.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/S4-EN-Guidelines-for-Prepare-Expression-of-Interest.pdf)) a first cut, reduces applications down to approximately 400 applications. From here applications are further stepped down to 50-60 who are asked to submit an advanced application, before reaching the final 6-7 grant recipients.

The process runs through a combination of assessment processes that combine:

1. An advisory body of 6 people with diverse knowledge and language capabilities,

2. Other EF staff members (often engaged in a "surge" fashion as demands of the process exceed usual capacities)

3. Move through a series of "rumbles" between small groups to assess and debate the selection choices

4. A different decision criteria is applied at each stage of the process

5. Reference checks from both previous donors and feminist ecosystem organisations

6. Background checks such as the anti-terrorism checklist

7. A final approval process where a docket that has been worked up through the above process is formally approved by the Equality Fund CEO

8. Recipient organisations sign a grant agreement that governs the terms of the funding across the lifetime of the grant. This includes commitments to regular reporting from the recipient organisation.

# Areas of exploration

Arising from the discovery process so far we have identified the following areas where we think exploration into possible new directions could bear fruit. They are laid out using the Evaluate, Propose, Decide, Execute structure outlined in the [Anticapture](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ) framework and including an additional "Beyond" category for areas of exploration that fall outside of improvements to the current processes.


**Evaluate**

1. How might we rethink the process of defining and assessing eligibility for applicants? How might we find and engage people who can validate aspects of a grant recipient's eligibility?

2. How can more applicants be processed with the same (or fewer) resources?

3. How can we build more context into the system to make better decisions? We need to balance a funding process that has integrity but doesn't overwhelm people. How might we increase the level of contextual information without relying on the applicants to provide it (in the form of more onerous form filling)?

4. How might we use and manage private data in more effective ways, such that important information can move more dynamically across the system while also ensuring that privacy and security or applicant data is maintained or improved? What becomes possible if this happens?

**Propose**

1. What opportunities exist to improve the quantity and quality (accuracy, level of trust, provenance etc) of information feeding into the selection process?

2. The advisory body are acknowledged as not having broad enough breadth, diversity, knowledge etc (based on having only 6 members). What opportunities are there to rethink this sense-making/deliberating function in the process?

**Decide**

1. What are the opportunities to explore augmenting the decentralised decision-making process that EF are already implementing to generate final decisions on grant allocation? 

**Execute**

1. The dispersal process to get funds into the hands of **recipients** across geographies is complicated, expensive and can create privacy and safety concerns. Crypto/web3 is purpose built to solve these kinds of problems. What possibilities might be low hanging fruit in the funds transfer space?

2. "There is a whole process of repeatedly reporting on grants to releasing more fund that is up for reimagining"


**Beyond**

1. What possibilities might exist to engage with or build a network around the large pool of 1000 initial applicants? E.g How can we broaden the application process so that the 1000 initial applicants can be networked into other **funding opportunities**, collaborations and shared learnings beyond this grant round.

2. Equality Fund leverages a portfolio approach in how they select and manage grant applicants. How could this be extended/expanded to smooth out some of the risks associated with getting grant decisions wrong?

3. How might we think about data analytics as a service to the community? Can we unlock collective intelligence across the community in some useful way?

# Possible directions

_What web3 patterns could be applied to transform aspects of the system based on the areas of exploration above?_

### Evaluate

The ways in which applications are sought, sorted and evaluated for eligibility

`Toggle`

1. **Data management using open protocols** - One of the biggest opportunities emerging out of crypto/web3 is for data that has traditionally been locked away in silos, to instead be stored in decentralised open protocols. This shift allows for an explosion of new opportunities to emerge that have the potential to transform the philanthropic graph making space.
   Having applicant data secured on a decentralised open protocol would allow for Equality Fund, and others, to innovate on the grant-making process in many different and interesting ways.
   **Considerations:**

  - **Privacy and security concerns** - Privacy and security of applicant's data is of critical importance especially with the context that many of Equality Fund's grant recipients operate in. Scepticism about the stability and safety of blockchain based data management often leads to the conclusion that the risk of using these solutions with sensitive data are too great. However, while it is true that many web3 patterns and practices are not yet mature enough to be safely relied upon, in time be believe it will become apparent that current approaches to data privacy and security (either self managed by philanthropic organisations themselves or using third party cloud providers) are significantly less secure than blockchain based solutions. 
 Blockchains, public/private key encryption and technologies such as zero knowledge (ZK) proofs and fully homomorphic encryption, are purpose designed to replace traditional data solutions with systems that are vastly more secure (as well as having additional properties such as censorship resistance, decentralised ownership/governance etc). While there are several aspects of the technology that need to evolve before it would be safe to suggest that Equality Fund experiment with using web3 patterns and practices to secure broad application data, we feel that there is real potential for this to be a transformational innovation in their grant-making process and that experimentation in this space would be highly valuable. 

  - **Data sovereignty** - If open permissionless protocols were to be used in the application process, applicants could retain ownership and control of their data making them sovereign participants in whatever patterns are implemented. This is a crucial step in overcoming the historic imbalances in power that have always been present in philanthropic grant-making processes, where (for often very practical reasons) recipient organisations suffer a distinct lack of agency compared to funding organisations. 
 On an open protocol, applicants could gain granular control over their data, permissioning access to it (or parts of it) based on enforceable agreements about how the data is going to be treated. They could choose to withdraw permission to access their data to anyone who has access if their circumstances, risk profile etc changed without relying on a funder's internal processes to protect their privacy and security. 

  - **Data as a community resource** - Application data managed on an open protocol (with common standards) would allow for the data to become a community resource. Rather than it being locked away inside a single organisation's silos, the broader ecosystem could have access to the data to search and derive insights from it. This could be done without the risk to applicants based on them having granular control over which data was accessible and with what levels of anonymity.  
 This could allow for innovation on top of the protocol to drive better and better funding mechanisms. For example applicant's projects could be made discoverable in safe ways allowing other funders and other support organisations, potential partners etc to reach them without them needing to engage in yet more laborious funding processes. 

  - **Harnessing network effects** - As more data is added to an open protocol and more people engage with it, the opportunities–for both the applicants and other organisations accessing the network–increase exponentially (see [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law)). Contrary to current systems that silo user data, having data on an open protocol (that is not gate-kept by any particular entity) creates the opportunity for network effects to take hold in ways that drive open innovation, whilst protecting against any one organisation capturing the network effects and attempting to dominate the network in an extractive way (the way large tech players do based on their closed proprietary data sets). Equality Fund moving grant application and other data onto open protocols could help drive similar dynamics in the grant-making space.

  - **AI innovation -** Using AI in the grant making process for eligibility assessment, background checks, group sense-making etc is a powerful emerging opportunity. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that if we try to implement AI solutions using existing approaches to data ownership and management, we will continue to perpetuate (and potentially amplify) many of the structural inequities that our current systems produce. There is an opportunity to use open permissionless protocols as the data layers that AI systems draw from. If these are well designed and executed on, they will create the possibility of a future where participants in grant-making processes retain control of the data that they contribute into systems, giving them the ability to decide who (and what) gets to see and use their data and under what conditions (agreements) and even giving them the opportunity to derive income from valuable their data that they produce. This is an important consideration for any future AI systems but of particular importance in the grant-making space given the inherent vulnerability of and disparities between grantees and others operating with the grant-making systems.     

  - **Execution** 

    - For insights about how we might think about building an open protocol that could produce some of the features mentioned above, please see the [windfall protocol litepaper](https://wp.docs.superbenefit.org/litepaper). This is a project that SuperBenefit is partnering on to build an open protocol that create a combination of open access with granular control of data (data sovereignty for those contributing to the system) for the residential energy/carbon efficiency space. 

    - Using a system like [Hats Protocol](https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/) could allow for granular control over who had access to onchain data relating to the the grant-making process. This would allow for access to be strongly and transparently permissioned, with access to different data at different stages of the process being easily turned on and off based on a defined eligibility criteria.

    - [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://attest.org/) (EAS) employs zero-knowledge proofs as part of its architecture which allows for attestation schema to be built and implemented in a privacy preserving way. This could form the basis for mechanisms that attest to the provenance and ownership of data on the protocol. 


**2. **Privacy-Preserving Eligibility Verification:**** **One practical first step towards some of the ideas above****,** **could be to explore** **ways to use** **privacy preserving technologies–such as **[**zero-knowledge** **(ZK)** **proofs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof)**–****to allow applicants to prove their eligibility****/****credentials without revealing sensitive information.** This would allow Equality Fund to limit the number of people who have access to critical identification data about an application to a very few people (or to no people at all), and to conversely allow a larger group of people from both inside and outside Equality Fund to participate in application assessment. 
 

**Recommendation:** currently we would not recommend running an experiment based on this technology, it is not quite mature enough to do this easily and safely. But we think that there is value in exploring these ideas with the intent of running an experiment the near future. 


**3. Impact Attestations for Accountability:** Another experimental area that could deliver on some of the promise outlined above would be to explore how community-based or third-party impact attestations could be used to validate grant applications. This would allow members of an applicants' community, partner organisations etc to generate impact attestations that could be used to build a picture of the impact that the applicant organisation is having in the community they are working in. 

This could help the grant-making process to be informed at the grassroots level and reduce the reliance of experts making assessments from afar. It could ensure greater transparency and richer information about applicants, without over-burdening them with additional documentation requirements.


These impact attestations could be combined with a reputation mechanism that would allow community members to build onchain credentials that lend weight to their attestations, as well as to create the opportunity for them to be rewarded for adding their intelligence to the grant-making process. 

 

**Recommendation:** we think that the current state of on-boarding and usability for many of the tools that will be required for a system like this is too early for us to recommend experimenting within the current Equality Fund grant-making programme.
However, projects like All In for Sport (a SuperBenefit and RP project partner) are looking to experiment with community impact attestations, engaging community members directly using web3 tools in relatively low risk scenarios. We believe that this work (along with other projects) will, in time, produce insights and practice that we could leverage to design an experiment appropriate for an Equality Fund context.  


### Propose / Decide

Propose - the ways in which recommendations about applicant selection are made and handled within the process 

Decide - the ways in which final decisions are made

Governance innovation is a huge part of web3 and there is a lot of research, activity and corresponding tooling being created in web3 to help groups of people to make decisions. The decision-making aspects of Equality Fund's grant-making process  could present a great opportunity to explore the use of some of these patterns and practices.

**1. Decentralised Applicant Assessment:** Tokenised voting presents an opportunity to expand participation in the grant selection process, allowing a broader range of contributors (e.g., community members, past grantees, partners, or even the general public) to have a say in which projects are funded.
There are currently many experiments underway using web3 patterns to decentralise how decision-making is done. Patterns like [Quadratic Voting/Funding](https://www.radicalxchange.org/wiki/quadratic-voting/), [Conviction Voting](https://token-engineering-commons.gitbook.io/tec-handbook/archive/archived-content/conviction-voting) and [Liquid Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy#:\~:text=Liquid%20democracy%20is%20a%20sort,vote%20on%20the%20delegated%20matter.) offer templates for coordinating preferences and insights from larger groups of people to produce richer decision-making processes than traditional methods.

**2. Reputation-Based Decision-Making:** another area to explore is the potential of creating a reputation system for reviewers, advisors, and applicants. Onchain reputation mechanisms could increase transparency and incentivise fair, accountable decision-making, while opening the selection process up to a broader group of participants.   

Rather than simply sourcing larger numbers of people to participate in a selection process, a reputation system would allow for better collective intelligence to be generated based on allowing for greater weighting of preferences based on factors such as a persons expertise/proximity to the applicant/lived experience/associations etc. A reputation system could build out of primitives such as [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://attest.org/) where individuals build an ever evolving reputation that attests to the positive qualities that qualify them to participate in the selection process. 

A second order effect of having such a reputation based decision-making system would make it easier for decentralise management of the selection process. Rather than relying on centralised HR style recruitment, individual groups participating across the selection process, would be able to easily find and recruit people with the right skills, experience and trusted reputations to fit their needs.

Designing our reputation system would need to sit across multiple dimensions of value that people might bring to a selection process. For example, it would need to include expert credentials and qualifications, histories of participation in previous selection processes, experience in other related fields, local geographic contexts, lived experience of problems spaces etc. As well as experience and expertise, it would also need to hold trust attestations such as formal roles, commitments to codes of conduct, signed NDAs and other legal agreements and responsibilities.

There are aspects of tokenised applicant assessment and reputation decision-making that could be folded into an experiment which we will outline below in suggester patterns. 

### Execute

_The ways in which the logistics of the process are managed_

- **Crypto-Based Fund Disbursement:** An opportunity exists to explore how defi (decentralised finance) protocols can be combined with things like impact attestations, onchain agreements etc could be used to automate and transparently execute grant disbursements. This could increase transparency and accountability for both grantees and funders, whilst massively decreasing friction and costs in the grant-making process.
 Defi protocols can provide important functions that could have a large positive impact on the process of grant disbursement. They include:

    - Privacy - transactions can be hidden/obscured from authorities when needed

    - Efficiency - transactions can be much cheaper and faster to execute than traditional wire transfer and "middle-man" based systems

    - Security - funds are at much lower risk of being stolen or "taxed" by predatory operators in the financial system.

    - Inflation resistance - defi mechanisms such as stablecoins can protect recipients from the erosion in value of local currencies in countries with high inflation

    - Transparency and traceability - funds can easily be tracked to recipients and receipt of funds can be confirmed onchain with a high degree of confidence (unless transparency is deliberately obscured for privacy/safety reasons) 

More on this opportunity to experiment with defi patterns is included below in suggested patterns.

- **Small autonomous teams working on assessment** - using governance patterns such as the[ DAO Primitives](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/dao-primitives-conceptual-framework-8258710376368272) and [Partnership Governance](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/partnership-governance-model-8964359175787644), Equality Fund could experiment with decentralising the execution of the grant selection process. If privacy and security could be managed through web3 patterns as mentioned above, the process of convening staff members and outside experts to participate in the grant selection process could be radically decentralised. This could involve forming a network of small autonomous teams that could organically reshape itself based on the moment by moment needs of the grant making process.
 Specific web3 tools could be used to implement things like governance and treasury management e.g using a [Moloch DAO structure ](https://daohaus.mirror.xyz/U_JQtheSzdpRFqQwf9Ow3LgLNG0WMZ6ibAyrjWDu_fc)
 
 It is likely too early to do this on a large scale, however an experiment involving one or more small teams could be practicable (see below)

### Beyond

_Potential opportunities to reimagine the process beyond specific features and functions of the existing grant-making process._ 

- **Decentralised Knowledge Sharing Platform -** Utilising open protocols for the storage and community access of data from across the broader funding process could produce significant community value. Information relating to; applicant orgs, funders, support orgs, individual contributors, impact attestations/outcomes etc could help to build an open knowledge resource that the broader community, governments, other funders etc could utilise to better understand the ecosystem, identify needs, create incentives etc. 
 The development of things like ZK technology, needed to make such a platform are still too immature to implement something like this safely at this point in time, but this is definitely an area with potential that should be tracked.   


- **A Fully Decentralised Funding Process:** Utilising open protocols for the storage and management of application data would create a number of opportunities for equality fund to innovate on its existing grant-making process, but beyond improving its own processes, the possibility would exist to reimagine how grant-making is done across the philanthropic sector more broadly. 
 
 Because data on an open protocol based system could be permissioned in flexible ways that protect the privacy and security of applicants (as described above), there is no reason that other philanthropic funders could not access the same system to find and assess organisations to receive funding as part of their own granting programmes. As such a system grew and benefited from network effects, the openness of the system would promote third-party organisations to innovate on top of it bringing as yet unimagined approaches to philanthropic funding. 
 
 Because of the data sovereignty protections that would be designed into such a protocol, as such a system scales, applicant organisations would have agency in the system, ensuring that it would evolve to serve their needs, alongside the needs of funders and other third-party organisations. 
 
 Such a system would benefit positively from network effects generated by having the value that the system as a whole increase as the number of organisations using the protocol increased– i.e more applicants means better granting opportunities ("deal flow") for funders and decreased marketing and admin costs; while more funders joining the system means greater opportunities to secure funding for grantee organisations. This network effect is of critical importance for a system to scale in order to disrupt the traditional philanthropic sector. But it is also important that the network effect is "captured" buy the protocol. I.e the network effect is "owned" by the protocol as a decentralised, capture resistant, open, [public good](https://research.protocol.ai/blog/2022/what-are-public-goods-and-commons/). 
 
 A larger vision such as this is out of scope for an immediate experiment as part of RPP collaboration, but it is important to keep an eye on the larger possibility space that is opening up as these web3 patterns and practices mature. 

  

# Suggested patterns 

From the possibilities outlined above, we suggest that the following areas comprise the "low hanging fruit" where an identified need that Equality Fund has can be matched with a practical executable experiment that could test a solution to that need. These suggestions are starting points for more collaboration between Equality Fund and the RPP to explore the ideas and to scope them out more fully.

**1. Crypto-Based Funds Disbursement** 
It is our belief that there is good potential to explore an experiment using a crypto based funds dispersal mechanism. As mentioned above, compared to existing processes for disbursing funds internationally, defi protocols can offer ways to disperse funds that enhance; privacy, efficiency, security, inflation resistance, as well as increased transparency and traceability.

Perhaps RPP could design a small experiment managing a grant disbursement using crypto rails. For this we would need to identify one or more organisations that Equality Fund are interested in funding at a level that would match the scope of the experiment and also which recipient organisations might fit the specific use-case requirements that would make them eligible and safe to include them in an experiment.

We anticipate that for a an experiment to be practicable, the amount of funding to be distributed via crypto rails (for the purposes of an experiment), would be smaller than the full funding that a typical recipient would receive (e.g perhaps $50k vs the $1m that the programme would typically grant)

- **Recipient Considerations** 

  - A recipient organisation needs to have certain basic capabilities in order for a crypto payment mechanism to make sense for them. They need to be able to:

    - Receive a crypto payment

    - Comply with local regulations with regard to crypto payments

    - Utilise crypto funds - there must be local intermediaries able to either off-ramp the funds into local currency/bank accounts, or the ability for an organisation to spend crypto in order to pay rent, staff etc.

    - If there are doubts about a recipients ability to handle a crypto payment (or a lack of sufficient onboarding support) then there are significant risks that could occur that include, for example, poor key management could lead to an organisation losing access to the funds, the funds being stolen or in other ways misappropriated. Members of the organisation could be financially or criminally liable based on local crypto laws and tax regulations etc

  - An ideal candidate would be an organisation that suffers from several of the following political/regional contexts:

    - Authoritarian/dangerous political/social climate (or some other context that requires them to operate in **secrecy**)

    - Insecure or inefficient banking and money transfer infrastructure

    - A high inflation or otherwise unstable economic environment

  - An ideal candidate would also likely reside in a country where there is high adoption of the use of crypto currencies, e.g Argentina. 


  - A simple approach to a funds disbursement experiment could include:

    - **What mechanisms might we use? (**  **&**  **) 
 **

- **Next steps**

  - This will require further conversation with Equality Fund (Sue) to understand more about how the current grant disbursement process works and how the possibility of using crypto rails could fit within existing processes.

  - We will also need to understand whether candidate recipient organisations (as suggested above) actually exist in Equality Fund's network and if the possibility of funding them in this way is practical.

  - Post this sense checking, we will need to explore the practical implications of doing the funds distribution and scope in more detail the actual tools and practices we will employ. I.e decide which defy patterns would be appropriate for this kind of experiment

**2. Some sort of onchain decision-making/reputation scoring prototype**

We believe that there is an opportunity to experiment with some combination of onchain decision-making, reputation and team coordination patterns. This will take more discussion to discover the right opportunity, but we think that it could include:

1. **Coordinating small groups** - during the selection process, groups process applications through a process of "rumbles". One or more of these groups could be enabled/enhanced by using web3 tools and practices. This would explore a solution to expressed concerns around the strain in scaling up "surging" input into the selection process a peak times. Possible benefits of this might include:

    - Leveraging decentralisation in the coordination of rumble teams

      - Increased autonomy for groups

      - Clear agreements and accountabilities for group members - on-chain role assignment, codes of conduct etc

    - On-chain decision-making

      - Greater transparency and auditability about how groups are making decisions

      - The ability for privacy in decision-making when it is needed

    - The efficient/scalable coordination of rumble teams - having a repeatable structure and sit of tools to easily spin up teams as needed

    - **Execution**

      - An experiment could begin by taking a single group and on-boarding them into a set of tools and practices within the existing selection process e.g:

        - Team structure based on the [DAO primitives](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/dao-primitives-conceptual-framework-8258710376368272) pattern (group scale, group phase, group state) and [Partnership Governance](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/partnership-governance-model-8964359175787644)

        - Role assignment via[ Hats Protocol](https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/)

        - Reputation via a tool such as [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/)

        - Treasury management

        - ****What mechanisms might we use**? (**  **&**  **)**


1. **Quadratic voting in review/selection process 
   **We could experiment with utilising quadratic voting as part of how applications are reviewed and selected. This could be done to explore solutions to the expressed concern at the limitations (diversity, breadth of context or experience) of the six person advisory panel. As well as this, quadratic voting methods could provide desired scalability to Equality Fund's processes. As above, we would need more collaboration between Equality Fund and the RPP to more fully understand the opportunity and begin to scope an experiment.
   An experiment with quadratic voting could create the following benefits:

    - It would create the opportunity to include a larger number of people–with more diverse clusters of context and experience–in the decision-making process without it becoming difficult/inefficient to manage.

    - Reviewers' preferences expressed through the quadratic voting mechanism could produce better selection decisions

    - **Execution**

      - The experiment could begin with a relatively small group and narrow focus, knowing that if results are promising quadratic voting can be expanded to encompass larger numbers of people with the specific context and experience that the selection process needs

      - An important part of an experiment will be testing whether it is possible  to on-board people to the tools needed to make a quadratic voting experiment work. 

      - **What mechanisms might we use? (**  **&**  **)

# Next steps

RP contributors will work closely with Sue to work through the above possible directions to narrow in on a direction and an experiment that can be run to explore it. Then we'll collectively develop a scoping document and create a proposal to put to the RPP core team for approval. This proposal will include the scope for the experiment as well as a budget, timelines etc. Following this, a team of contributors from the SuperBenefit network, and ideally team members of the Equality Fund will execute on the experiment.

# Working Notes 👇

`What outcome are we trying to achieve with the experiment?`

- Demonstrating the potential of web3 adoption at Equality Fund through a practical experiment.

## Objectives

`What activities and outputs will we produce to affect the desired outcome?`

- To create and execute an experiment that can capture the imagination of people within EF.

- To achieve administrative and/or operational enhancements to EF's grantmaking cycle(s) which enable scaling.

- To advance language and information justice for applicants, recipients and beneficiaries.

## Requirements

`What criteria must a potential experiment satisfy to be considered valid?`

- A successful experiment needs to be derived from the wider analysis of the Equality Fund granting system, but be small and executable. It is important to get something done and not just conducting a research project.  

- A potential experiment must be easy to present and communicate across the organization.

- (nice to have) The experiments should, in some way, produce a collaborative synergy between RPP stakeholders and/or experiments.

### Constraints

`What material and social constraints exist around experimentation?`

- Initially we will be constrained by the funding and other resources that the RPP can contribute to the exploration, including the time that Sue Snider (from Equality Fund) will be able to commit to the design process. Once we are into actually experiment scoping, it is possible that Equality Fund can contribute more people (and potentially other resources). This will be based on having a clear design that people inside of EF can get excited about. 

### Exclusions

`What will the scope of experimentation definitely not include?`

- Experiments will be confined to the Prepare grantmaking cycle.

# System Mapping

## Current State

`Map the state of the current system according to the facilitation framework`

**The current grant process follows these steps:**

From a wider pool of \~1000 applications (responses from an [EOI](https://equalityfund.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/S4-EN-Guidelines-for-Prepare-Expression-of-Interest.pdf)) a first cut, reduces applications down to approximately 400 applications. From here applications are further stepped down to 50-60 who are asked to submit an advanced application, before reaching the final 6-7 grant recipients.

The process runs through a combination of assessment processes that combine:

1. An advisory body of 6 people with diverse knowledge and language capabilities,

2. Other EF staff members (often engaged in a "surge" fashion as demands of the process exceed usual capacities)

3. Move through a series of "Rumbles" between small groups to assess and debate the selection choices

4. A different decision criteria is applied at each stage of the process

5. Reference checks from both previous donors and feminist ecosystem organisations

6. Background checks such as the anti-terrorism checklist

7. A final approval process where a docket that has been worked up through the above process is formally approved by the EF CEO

8. Recipient organisations sign a grant agreement that includes how they are going to use the funding, stages for the funding and regular reporting.

### Current Issues

`What issues are present in the current system which might be addressed through web3 experimentation`

- Scalability - the current process is not efficient and struggles to scale up as during the surge times

- Scope of input - it is acknowledged that the current six person advisory panel cannot not represent sufficient diversity and depth of experience to match the breath of different languages, impact areas, domains etc of the over 1000 applications that require assessment.

- Data & insights - currently there is no way for the broader community to benefit from the data and insights that are currently locked inside the selection process

- Funds dispersal - currently there are issues with cost, accessibility and security with regard to funds being dispersed to recipient organisations

- Grant reporting - the process by which recipient organisations report on usage of funds throughout the life of the grant is laborious and efficient
