## Purpose

The Reimagining Power project requires an updated knowledge management experience at SuperBenefit to support its contributor onboarding and workflow needs. We're migrating our knowledge base to from Clarity to Charmverse as part of this effort.

A large number of documents of documents on Clarity are orphaned and in need of review and (if needed) migration to the new cultural databases on Charmverse. These documents must be moved to Charmverse before we can begin updating and publishing the various information resource throughout this space.

## Recommended Practices

Useful entries in [Clarity's tags database](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/tags) should be moved to the cultural database on Charmverse.

Each tag must be reviewed. If a tag meets the criteria below, it should be copied into the appropriate database in Charmverse.

### Outcomes

When this task is complete, all relevant entries in Clarity's "tags" page (including pages linked within tag pages) should be migrated to either the Lexicon or Artifacts databases.

Hard-to-migrate items should be noted for follow-up by the core team.

The current status of the databases should be described in the Information Directory, along with any notes which may be useful to future editors.
