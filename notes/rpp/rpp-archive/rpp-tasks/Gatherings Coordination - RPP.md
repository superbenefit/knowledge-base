# Purpose

Reimagining Power is committed to facilitating a number of gatherings as part of its engagement with OTF. In addition, other gatherings will be held by SuperBenefit, All in For Sport and other network peers, which may serve a strategic purpose in the Reimagining Power project.

## Goals

This Gatherings Coordination task aims to ensure that RPP's gatherings are delivered and fit for purpose, that AIFS and SB gatherings are supported and resourced (to the extent we are able), and that reporting and metrics for Gatherings are accurate and effectively communicated.
