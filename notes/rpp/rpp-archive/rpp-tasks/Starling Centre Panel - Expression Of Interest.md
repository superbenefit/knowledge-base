# Reimagining Power: Building Open-Source Infrastructures for Decentralized Futures

The Reimagining Power Project (RPP) is a global research and action initiative exploring how emerging technologies can help to redistribute power, mobilize capital, and transform systems toward more equitable outcomes.

The RPP explores how to:

- Shift power from centralized entities to communities through participatory governance and decentralized coordination. 

- Mobilize capital in more collectively intelligent, distributed and equitable ways that prioritize grassroots and community-led initiatives. 

- Create and share open-source playbooks, contributing to the knowledge commons by enabling others to replicate and build upon these governance models in their own contexts. 

- Weave networks across organizations that share similar goals, fostering collaboration and the exchange of knowledge and resources. 

Our current research examines community-controlled AI for knowledge sovereignty, piloting federated AI agent swarms that provide locally governed, privacy-preserving, non-extractive AI infrastructures, resisting the corporate enclosure of knowledge by providing practical tools that put community data sovereignty first, ensuring new technologies serve local needs.

Our findings engage with the idea of "Just Technologies for Just Societies", deconstructing how emerging infrastructures encode, resist, or reproduce existing power asymmetries. Our work aligns with the conference theme of "Reverberations" by probing how the impact of specific implementations and ownership structures of emerging technologies can ripple through social and institutional contexts, shaping new possibilities for mutual aid, collective ownership, and coordinated action.

A comprehensive report on the RPP is being written as Phase 1 wraps up. We look forward to the opportunity to share our paper and findings with the academic community at 4S 2025Â and beyond.

Deadline: Feb 2, 23:59

The Starling Centre is looking for contributions for our Open Panel: "Just Technologies for Just Societies" for the #4SSeattle24 Conference. See full call for proposals on our website, starlingcentre.ca, and apply at bit.ly/3BtgXPh by 31 January!

Hi Heenal, feel free to submit your proposal. I'm not the only person on the decision making committee so it'll depend on what my colleagues think and the other proposals we receive. For what it's worth this is definitely an acedemic conference but that doesn't mean it's not possible to be more inclusive. Btw the deadline for submission was moved to Sunday at midnight BC there were some glitches with the submission platform
