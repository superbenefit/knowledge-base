All In For Sport (AIFS) is an experiment to bring together diverse communities in Emerging Tech and Sports to learn, share and explore community initiatives that advance inclusion and empowerment through sport around the world.

Sport can be a major catalyst toward inclusion and empowerment in communities. But to date, existing systems have not been designed to action community support where it is needed. AIFS believes philanthropy has an opportunity to outsize impact by supporting sport: if reimagined. 

AIFS Is creating a sandbox for innovation with a goal is to bring in diverse groups currently innovating and creating social change through sport. The goal is to build a community of supports with these innovators in sport.
