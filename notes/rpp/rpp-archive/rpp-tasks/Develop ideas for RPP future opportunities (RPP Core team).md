**Context:**

This document/task is to capture the different ideas that are emerging for RPP next steps. It is broader than just what can we fund for the next OTF round but it does include this. The goal is to explore where the interesting opportunities might be and from there we can figure out what could be wrapped up in an OTF funding application. 

The starting sections are based on ideas that have surfaced at recent team meetings. 

Feel free to add in new sections, content to the existing sections and comment on what is there.   

Feel free to go hog wild in here, we are not hoping to get to clear winners from this doc. This is the raw input for the process of sense-making our way to some contenders for the next round of OTF funding the for the RPP in general.

**Suggested criteria for evaluating ideas:**

- What are folks (individually and collectively) interested in doing?

- What fulfills the mission / intention of RPP?

- What is valuable to stakeholders?

- What are the synergies between these?

### BOANN opportunities

- Offer to play a convening role to bring partners together to explore/design an institutional crypto fund of some sort, like we did with Windfall. Pull partners and community together to work towards a white/lite paper

### Redefinition/refinement of RPP mission

- Articulating why blockchains are important for equitable community funding and governance

- Positioning AI and crypto as the important place to play. Not just adding AI to x

- Refining the Windfall project style convening that SB can do to help parties come together to do novel things

- Illustrating RPP progress so far, and how our current work is thematically and practically linked to future topic of interest.

### Extending current playbook project

- Continuation of the playbooks work. Building on the experiments with ICS, AIFS and EF (+ windfall and other things outside of RPP)

  - Adding additional patterns to existing playbooks

  - Adding additional playbooks to library

### Extending the gatherings program

- Widening the reach and extending (or further focusing) the subject matter

- Collaborating with other groups in web3 sport for good.

### Experimenting with quadratic funding at a local level

- Experimenting with how to make QF more accessible at a local level as interest has been shown from several groups

  - Could include developing and piloting a low-barrier phone-based app for participating in local QF rounds

- Could include running one or more QF experiments in a local community

- Maybe coordinate with Bioregional funding initiatives (see below)

### Publishing - what new stories do we have to tell? 

- Developing a paper or set of resources about how we might rethink the concept of impact investing in the crypto space. Sense making for partners and community participants  

- How can AI be used with crypto primitives to contribute to a ground up revolution in org design, philanthropy, community engagement etc etc. Reclaiming the narrative from centralized AI companies to are promoting a centralized paternalistic vision of AI

- Why we think blockchains matter. Updated thinking to make clear the value that we are trying to articulate to funders etc

- How the concept of purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams is an important part of how we organize in a rapidly changing (AI enabled) world. 

- Producing zines and other materials to educate/interest the public in emerging social tech

### **AI specific opportunities around the convergence of crypto and AI**

- The possibility of developing some in-house AI agent experiments 

  - SB Documentation agent/bot - develop an AI tool that is trained on SB's documentation to make SB governance more efficient and effective. E.g Proposals: writing, improving, understanding and voting on. Reporting: extracting, curating, structuring and presenting information. Use this as an experiment to develop a sharable bot that other DAOs can adopt

  - Playbooks agent/bot - develop and AI tool trained on the playbooks documentation. This can improve usability of the frameworks we are developing by surfacing what people need from the documentation as they need it. Look at tools like Citizen chat as a starting point

  - AI Innovation Fund - the AI for Social Impact Collaborative, SETSI, OTF are in early discussions, could dovetail with Boann

### Developing ideas/projects around community capital 

- Locking philanthropic capital in a protocol - Explore developing the thinking, coordination, partnerships etc for implementing something like a Null fund/exponential endowment fund - Solidarity economies 

- An experiment around developing a web3 version of a community foundation 


### Explore ideas in bioregional finance (BIOFI)

- Connecting with and supporting local communities working on biofi projects

- Supporting the establishment of bioregional hubs and/or BFFs

### Opportunities around impact attestations and hyper-certs

- Develop EAS schemas for particular categories of impact/organization

- Onboard community organizations to web3 and assist them in minting hypercerts/attestations

### ****Digitally Enabled Community Foundation of the Future****

- Build a playground for testing out a digitally enabled community foundation of the future rooted in transforming capital and philanthropy for a future where everyone belongs. (in discussions at CFC lightly around this)

- Elements: digital first infrastructure including AI and web3/blockchain; integration into governance, granting, investing, reporting, participatory approaches, systems and futures oriented

- AI Innovation Fund and other Collaborative Funds to be tested as a live experiment in the playground/sandbox

# Meeting Notes

## Meeting #1 (20/1/25)

- Rowan provided context on the Reimagining Power project and the need for a sense-making process involving diversity of ideas, connectivity, interdependence, and adaptability to allow emergence of new directions.

- Participants discussed the potential of creating a fund, with ideas like a null fund for community funding, a crypto fund like Windfall, or a fund to facilitate funding of experiments and projects in the impact space.

- Lewwwk proposed the idea of a debt fund that could generate higher returns than traditional investments, with the excess returns being pooled for impact initiatives like AI-enabled community foundations.

- Participants explored the feasibility of Lewwwk's debt fund idea, including potential investments, risk profiles, institutional partnerships, and currency hedging mechanisms.

- The group considered the possibility of seeking funding to explore and design the debt fund idea further, potentially from sources like Boann or other funders.

- Rowan suggested that Super Benefit could spin up a cell to explore the debt fund idea in a contained manner, similar to the approach taken with the Reimagining Power Project and Windfall.

- Michelle proposed discussing the debt fund idea at a high level with Boann during an upcoming meeting to gauge their interest and potential involvement.

- Lewwwk offered to provide a few bullet points on how to frame the debt fund idea for the meeting with Boann.

Minutesüìù 2:01 PM - Discord meeting January 20 Notes üïû Started at 02:01 PM on 20 Jan, lasted 1h 5mReimagining Power Project and Super Benefit InitiativesThe meeting was convened to discuss the future of the Reimagining Power project and Super Benefit. These initiatives are closely linked, as one creates opportunities for the other.The group had previously compiled ideas in a document and opened it for contributions. Recognizing the limitations of asynchronous collaboration, they decided to hold this focused session for sensemaking and creativity.The goal was to identify potential strategic directions and projects to pursue.Sensemaking Framework IntroductionRowan introduced a framework for the sensemaking process, emphasizing its inherent complexity. Effective sensemaking requires diversity of ideas, connectivity between people and concepts, interdependence, and adaptability.The process involves considering various factors such as constraints, emerging opportunities, potential risks, specific knowledge domains, future visions, ecosystem views, stakeholder insights, trends, and probability assessments.Rowan cautioned against oversimplified methodologies like Design Thinking, which often fail to achieve the necessary depth for truly emergent ideas. Instead, he proposed a more nuanced approach involving deep dives into shared sense-making, idea refinement, asynchronous development, side conversations, individual work, resyncing with the group, and network synchronization.He emphasized the importance of each participant taking responsibility for advocating their ideas and perspectives.Review of Compiled IdeasThe group reviewed a range of ideas previously compiled, including extensions and rearticulations of existing Reimagining Power Project work, community capital projects inspired by the null fund concept, bioregional finance initiatives, ETY stations and hypersets (involving AI and crypto convergence), quadratic funding at the local level, network-based organizational models for Super Benefit, AI-enabled funding mechanisms, Community Foundations of the Future concept, potential partnerships with organizations like CRM and the Equality Fund, and Blockchain-Oriented Networks (BON).Crypto-Enabled Debt Fund ProposalLuke introduced a detailed proposal for a crypto-enabled debt fund. The fund would allow foundations and other interested parties to deposit capital, potentially generating higher returns (8-12%) compared to traditional finance products (4.5%).The excess returns would be pooled to resource specific areas of interest, such as AI development, community foundation functionality, or energy efficiency projects.The fund would leverage existing crypto lending markets and risk management services like Gauntlet. Challenges include currency fluctuation risks for non-USD investors and the need for institutional-grade products and partnerships.The proposal aims to unlock more resources for impact work by tapping into existing endowments and deployed reserves.Discussion on Fund ProposalThe group engaged in a detailed discussion of the fund proposal, considering its potential to solve the perennial problem of accessing capital for high-risk, high-impact projects.They discussed the global applicability of the fund and potential currency hedging solutions. Concerns about capture by traditional financial institutions and the need for protocol-owned solutions were raised.The possibility of using this as an opportunity to shape the emerging crypto-finance space for impact investing was considered. Potential funding sources for further exploration and development of the concept, including Bowen, CFC, or other impact-oriented funders, were identified.Next Steps and PlanningThe group agreed to continue exploring the fund proposal, alongside other ideas from the original compilation. They planned to use the next day's meeting to further refine the fund concept and prepare for an upcoming meeting with Bowen.Luke was tasked with drafting some bullet points to frame the proposal. The Fig Jam document would continue to be used as a collaborative space for idea development.Leveraging Super Benefit's existing mechanisms for exploring new initiatives, potentially spinning up a dedicated cell for this project, was considered. How this proposal might fit into a larger funding request for the Reimagining Power project was also discussed.
