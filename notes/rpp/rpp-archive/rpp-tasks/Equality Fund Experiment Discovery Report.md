# Summary

This report outlines key insights from the discovery phase of the partnership between the Reimagining Power project team and Equality Fund. 

We examined how web3 tools could innovate Equality Fund's global feminist grant-making, with particular focus on:

- Collective power and community accountability

- Trust at scale

- Distributed ownership and feminist futures

The RPP is focused on the Prepare funding stream, which manages CAD 7 million across four categories, selecting 6-7 grants from approximately 1,000 applications. The current grant-making process systematically narrows this pool through multiple stages involving advisory input, staff contributions, collaborative decision-making, and comprehensive checks.

Our discovery process identified several areas where web3 patterns and practices could have profound impacts on grant-making. Through structured exploration of the process, we examined five key areas:

1. Initial screening & evaluation

2. Portfolio selection & proposal

3. Decision-making & approval process

4. Grant administration and disbursal 

5. Beyond the current process

While many identified opportunities require further technological maturation, two patterns emerged as immediately viable for experimentation:

- A crypto-based mechanism for funds disbursement

- On-chain decision-making and reputation scoring systems

We will work closely with stakeholders to develop these experiments into concrete proposals, including detailed scoping, budgets, and timelines. Implementation will leverage expertise from both the SuperBenefit network and Equality Fund team members.

This report is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather captures our shared learnings to support practical and implementable experiments while maintaining awareness of future innovation opportunities.

# Background & Current Process

Equality Fund is partnering with Super Benefit through the Reimagining Power Project to explore using web3 tools to innovate its global feminist grant-making. The goal is to evolve grant-making processes in ways that prioritize promoting collective power, community accountability, trust at scale, distributed ownership and feminist futures.

Significant thinking has already gone into the concept of Equality Fund implementing a DISCO. This discovery process aims to uncover practical opportunities to move in this direction by experimenting within current grant processes.

The project focuses on Equality Fund's Prepare funding stream, which manages CAD 7 million across four categories. The current process begins with approximately 1,000 applications and systematically narrows these to 6-7 final grants, with disbursement beginning January 1, 2025.

The selection process incorporates several key elements:

- An advisory body providing diverse knowledge and language capabilities

- A "surge" of staff members from across Equality Fund

- Collaborative decision-making through "rumbles"

- Stage-specific evaluation criteria

- Final CEO approval

- Comprehensive reference and background checks

- Detailed grant agreements with recipients

These features serve as surface areas where web3 patterns and practices could reimagine aspects of Equality Fund's grant-making process.

Currently, the Equality Fund has limited exposure to and some skepticism about Web3. Consequently, the RPP team will collaborate with Sue Snider from Equality Fund to explore potential experimental directions. Once the experiment is better defined, we will involve additional team members and resources from Equality Fund to effectively present and support the initiative.

Rather than exploring many possibilities, Equality Fund has a desire to narrow in on a concrete practical experiment. We aim to move quickly towards a narrowly scoped but deep and impactful experiment.

# Areas of Exploration

Our discovery process revealed significant opportunities to enhance Equality Fund's grant-making through web3 technologies. We identified five key areas where innovative approaches could address current challenges while advancing core values of decentralization, transparency, and community empowerment.

## Initial Screening & Evaluation

The initial application review process presents unique challenges in scaling assessment while maintaining quality. Key questions include:

- How might we create a more efficient and inclusive process for assessing applicant eligibility while maintaining high standards?

- How can we scale application processing capacity without requiring additional resources?

- What methods could help us gather richer contextual information about applications without increasing the burden on applicants?

- How can we improve the management and flow of sensitive applicant data while ensuring privacy and security?

## Portfolio Selection & Proposal

The current advisory process has natural limitations in scope and scale that could be addressed through new approaches:

- How might we improve both the quantity and quality of information used in selection decisions?

- What mechanisms could expand our advisory capacity beyond the current six-person model while maintaining decision quality?

- How can we better capture and utilize diverse expertise in the proposal review process?

## Decision Making & Approval Process

Final grant decisions require balancing multiple stakeholders and considerations:

- How might we augment the existing decentralized decision-making process to improve final grant selections?

- What mechanisms could help distribute decision-making authority while managing risk?

- How can we make the approval process more transparent while maintaining necessary controls?

## Grant Administration & Disbursal

The mechanics of grant distribution present significant operational challenges:

- How might we simplify and secure the process of disbursing funds across different geographies?

- What approaches could streamline grant reporting while maintaining accountability?

- How can we reduce costs and complexity in fund transfers while protecting recipient privacy?

## Beyond Current Process

Looking ahead, we see opportunities to create broader value from the grant-making process:

- How might we create ongoing value for all applicants, beyond those selected for grants?

- What opportunities exist to build collective intelligence and shared learning across the funding community?

- How can we evolve the portfolio approach to better manage risk while increasing impact?

This exploration helped us identify several promising patterns and opportunities that could be tested through focused experiments...

# Possibilities for Experimentation

_What web3 patterns could be applied to transform aspects of the system based on the areas of exploration above?_

## 

## Data Management Using Open Protocols

One of the biggest opportunities emerging from crypto/web3 is moving data from traditional silos into decentralized open protocols. This shift enables new possibilities that could transform philanthropic grant-making. Having applicant data secured on a decentralized open protocol would allow Equality Fund and others to innovate their grant-making processes in multiple ways. Several key aspects of this approach deserve careful consideration:

- **Privacy and Security**
 Privacy and security of applicant data is critically important, especially given the context many of Equality Fund's grant recipients operate in. While skepticism about blockchain-based data management often leads to concerns about using these solutions with sensitive data, we believe current approaches to data privacy and security (whether self-managed by philanthropic organizations or using third-party cloud providers) will prove significantly less secure than blockchain-based solutions in the long term.

 Blockchains, public/private key encryption, and technologies such as zero knowledge (ZK) proofs and fully homomorphic encryption are purpose-designed to replace traditional data solutions with vastly more secure systems. These solutions also offer additional benefits like censorship resistance and decentralized ownership/governance.

 While several aspects of the technology need to evolve before safely implementing web3 patterns for broad application data, we see real potential for transformational innovation in the grant-making process through experimentation in this space.

- **Community Resource Benefits**
 Application data managed on an open protocol with common standards could become a valuable community resource. Rather than being locked within organizational silos, the broader ecosystem could access and derive insights from this data. This could be accomplished safely through granular control over data accessibility and anonymity levels.

 This approach could drive innovation in funding mechanisms. For example, applicant projects could be discoverable in secure ways, allowing other funders, support organizations, and potential partners to connect without requiring additional lengthy funding processes.

- **Network Growth and Value**
 As more data is added to an open protocol and engagement increases, opportunities for both applicants and organizations accessing the network grow exponentially (see [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law)). Unlike current systems that silo user data, having data on an open protocol creates opportunities for network effects that drive open innovation while protecting against single-entity capture and exploitation.

- **AI Innovation
 **Using AI for eligibility assessments, background checks, and group decision-making in grant-making offers powerful opportunities. However, traditional data ownership and management can perpetuate structural inequities. By adopting open permissionless protocols, systems can allow participants to control their data, make decisions about its usage, and potentially earn from it. These data sovereignty considerations are especially important in grant-making to address the inherent power imbalances between grant-maker and grantee.  

## Verification and Accountability

The integration of web3 technologies enables new approaches to verifying eligibility and measuring impact, potentially transforming how grant-making organizations evaluate and track their work:

- **Privacy-Preserving Eligibility**
 One practical first step toward implementing these ideas would be exploring privacy-preserving technologies like [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof). These would allow applicants to prove eligibility without revealing sensitive information, enabling Equality Fund to limit access to critical identification data while potentially expanding participation in application assessment.

- **Impact Attestations**
 Another promising experimental area involves using community-based or third-party impact attestations to validate grant applications. This would allow community members and partner organizations to generate attestations demonstrating an applicant's community impact, helping inform grant-making at the grassroots level and reducing reliance on distant expert assessments.

 These attestations could integrate with reputation mechanisms, allowing community members to build onchain credentials that strengthen their attestations while creating opportunities for rewarding their contributions to the grant-making process.

## Governance and Decision-Making

Web3 technologies offer new possibilities for structuring and managing organizational decision-making, potentially transforming how grant-making organizations operate and allocate resources:

- **Decentralized Assessment**
 Tokenized voting could expand participation in grant selection, allowing broader contributor groups (community members, past grantees, partners, or the public) to influence funding decisions. Current web3 experiments with patterns like [Quadratic Voting/Funding](https://www.radicalxchange.org/wiki/quadratic-voting/), [Conviction Voting](https://token-engineering-commons.gitbook.io/tec-handbook/archive/archived-content/conviction-voting) and [Liquid Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy) offer templates for coordinating preferences from larger groups to enhance decision-making.

- **Autonomous Assessment Teams**
 Using governance patterns like [DAO Primitives](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/dao-primitives-conceptual-framework-8258710376368272) and [Partnership Governance](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/partnership-governance-model-8964359175787644), Equality Fund could experiment with decentralizing grant selection execution. With proper privacy and security management, this could enable organizing staff and external experts into small autonomous teams that adapt to process needs.

 Specific implementation could use tools like [Moloch DAO structure](https://daohaus.mirror.xyz/U_JQtheSzdpRFqQwf9Ow3LgLNG0WMZ6ibAyrjWDu_fc) for governance and treasury management. While full-scale implementation may be premature, experimenting with one or more small teams could prove practical.

## Future Horizons

While many web3 implementations are possible today, emerging technologies and maturing practices point toward even more transformative possibilities for the future of grant-making:

- **Decentralized Knowledge Platform**
 Open protocols for storing and accessing funding process data could create significant community value. Information about applicant organizations, funders, support organizations, contributors, and impact outcomes could build an open knowledge resource benefiting the broader community, governments, and funders. While current privacy technology maturity makes immediate implementation impractical, this represents an important area for future development.

- **Fully Decentralized Funding**
 Open protocols for application data management could enable reimagining grant-making across the philanthropic sector. Privacy-protecting permissioning could allow multiple funders to access the same system for assessment while promoting third-party innovation. Data sovereignty protections would ensure the system evolves to serve all stakeholders' needs.

 Such a system could leverage network effects as participation increases, benefiting both applicants and funders through improved opportunities and reduced costs. Importantly, these network effects would be "captured" by the protocol itself as a decentralized, capture-resistant public good rather than any single organization.

While this vision exceeds current RPP collaboration scope, it illustrates the broader possibilities emerging as web3 patterns and practices mature.

# Suggested Patterns

_What we think the best experimental possibilities are._

Based on our analysis of Equality Fund's current grant-making process and the maturity of web3 technologies, we've identified two key areas where practical experimentation could address specific needs. These suggestions serve as starting points for further collaboration between Equality Fund and RPP to develop one or more experiments.

Our recommendations focus on implementation-ready solutions that can demonstrate immediate value while building toward longer-term transformation. We prioritized approaches that balance innovation with pragmatism, ensuring experiments can be conducted safely while providing meaningful insights into the potential of web3 technologies in grant-making.

Through careful consideration of Equality Fund's operational context and risk tolerance, we recommend exploring two distinct but complementary experiments. The first explores crypto-based funds disbursement to address immediate operational challenges in international grant distribution. The second investigates onchain decision-making tools to enhance the existing collaborative grant selection process. Both experiments would designed to be contained, measurable, and scalable if successful.

## **1: Crypto-Based Funds Disbursement**

Decentralized finance protocols and privacy-preserving payment tools have evolved significantly since 2020. Current implementations include privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, zero-knowledge payment systems, and programmable escrow mechanisms. These tools enable secure international value transfer with features like encrypted transaction data, selective disclosure of payment details, and automated compliance checks.

We propose exploring crypto-based mechanisms for international funds disbursement as a focused initial experiment. This approach directly addresses key operational challenges in global grant distribution while offering meaningful improvements in:

- Privacy and security of transactions

- Operational efficiency and reduced costs

- Selective transparency for accountability

Our recommendation is to design a focused experiment with carefully selected recipient organizations. The scope should be narrow enough to enable thorough testing of the mechanisms while gathering actionable insights about implementation challenges and opportunities.

### 

### Recipient Considerations

Implementing crypto payment mechanisms requires careful evaluation of both organizational capabilities and operating context. Before implementation, organizations must demonstrate competency in crypto transaction management, regulatory compliance, and currency conversion pathways – whether through fiat off-ramps or direct crypto utilization.

Several key risks require active mitigation:

- Loss of funds through poor key management

- Theft or misappropriation of funds

- Legal/regulatory compliance issues

The strongest implementation candidates typically operate in regions with compromised banking infrastructure, high inflation, or established crypto adoption patterns. Areas requiring enhanced operational privacy due to political climate often present particularly compelling use cases.

## **2: Onchain Decision-Making and Reputation Scoring**

Equality Fund's "rumble" process represents a sophisticated approach to collaborative grant selection. Web3 tools offer opportunities to enhance this process by providing structured coordination mechanisms and capturing participant contributions over time.

We propose exploring a targeted experiment combining onchain decision-making with reputation tracking. By implementing tools like DAO primitives and Hats Protocol, we could create clearer operational structures for rumble teams while building institutional memory of participant expertise and contributions.

The initial experiment would focus on a single selection group to minimize disruption while testing core concepts:

- Team coordination using DAO primitives to manage group scale and process phases

- Role definition and permissions through Hats Protocol

- Transparent treasury management for operational costs

- Reputation tracking to recognize participant contributions


A successful pilot could inform gradual expansion to additional selection teams, with implementation details refined based on measured outcomes and participant feedback.

# Next Steps

We recommend a phased collaboration between the RPP team and Sue to transform these potential directions into actionable initiatives.

The proposed process would begin by refining and narrowing the potential directions into a specific experimental approach that aligns with both organizations' capabilities and goals. This could be followed by developing a comprehensive scoping document detailing implementation requirements and constraints. Based on this groundwork, we'll then submit a proposal to both Equality Fund and the RPP core team, including suggested budget allocations and implementation timelines.

For successful execution, we recommend forming a team that draws expertise from both the SuperBenefit network and Equality Fund to ensure effective knowledge transfer and maintain strategic alignment throughout implementation.
