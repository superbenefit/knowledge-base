**Brief Project History**:

The Reimagining Power Project (RPP) began when founding members of SuperBenefit DAO, partnered with Ontario Trillium Foundation, Equality Fund, All in for Sport, Institute for Community Sustainability. With seed funding from Ontario Trillium Foundation, the initiative was created to explore how Web3 technologies could redistribute power, mobilize resources, and foster systemic transformation for equity and regeneration. 

Since its launch in September 2023, RPP has developed decentralized governance frameworks, piloted participatory grantmaking, and created open-source playbooks for organizations adopting Web3-enabled systems. 

Its goal is to bridge local knowledge with global solutions, fostering community resilience and advancing equitable access to resources. 

Building on this foundation, the Infinite Front Porch project expands RPP‚Äôs impact by enabling the local network knowledge sharing and collaboration necessary for grassroots climate resilience. It aims to create an opensource framework to create globally networkable local knowledge commons, fostering collaboration and innovation towards climate resilience, that is underpinned by community agency and data sovereignty. 

In an increasingly digital world, vast reservoirs of human knowledge and wisdom remain untapped because they exist beyond the reach of current technology. The Infinite Front Porch project aims to bridge this gap by creating networks of AI agents that work with human partners to gather, preserve, and share knowledge from traditionally excluded sources. 

By combining breakthrough AI capabilities with community-owned infrastructure, we are building a system where communities maintain control of their knowledge while participating in meaningful exchange with others, transforming how we collectively understand and address global challenges.

The Infinite Front Porch project begins by delivering a working example of a successful AI enabled knowledge commons, and then scales by sharing the opensource framework and technical modules used to do this, so that communities around the world can build their own networkable knowledge commons.

1 / 800

The Infinite Front Porch project builds on the proven work of the Reimagining Power Project (RPP), which has already piloted decentralized governance models and regenerative finance experiments. With RPP as a foundation, the Infinite Front Porch is transitioning from concept to implementation, leveraging existing knowledge and partnerships to create locally governed AI agents, coordination protocols, and playbooks. This project is ready to scale with targeted funding for development and deployment.

## Additional Questions

### Please explain how your project is a part of the solution to the climate crisis. \*

1 / 3000

Our vision is to create an "infinite front porch" - a network of sovereign AI agents dedicated to discovering, preserving, and sharing knowledge that exists beyond traditional digital boundaries.

The Infinite Front Porch directly addresses one of the greatest obstacles to solving the climate crisis: the fragmented and inaccessible nature of critical knowledge. While solutions for climate adaptation, mitigation, and regeneration exist, they are often isolated within specific regions, organizations, or communities, limiting their effectiveness and scalability.

Our AI swarm is designed to act as both a knowledge bridge and amplifier. Using locally governed AI agents, communities can:

1. **Surface Local Knowledge**: Agents enable communities to extract insights from data sources, oral histories, and traditional practices, ensuring no valuable information is left untapped.

2. **Combine and Amplify Wisdom**: The swarming protocol enables AI agents to synthesize information from multiple sources, creating new insights and scalable solutions for climate adaptation, mitigation, and resilience.

3. **Retain Sovereignty**: The swarm uses decentralized Web3 infrastructure, allowing communities to maintain control over their data while sharing actionable insights across the network.

By co-creating a decentralized knowledge commons, the project not only addresses the urgent need for climate action but also empowers communities to co-create solutions that are locally relevant and globally impactful.

By combining local-first agents with Web3 infrastructure‚Äîincluding permissionless blockchains and privacy-preserving zero knowledge proofs‚Äîwe enable granular control over how knowledge is owned, shared, and protected. This synthesis creates a pathway to unlock the untapped potential of community knowledge while ensuring communities retain genuine sovereignty over their information. It can gather and honor knowledge from the edges of our networks, while ensuring genuine community ownership and data sovereignty.

Each community has an AI agent that can understand and generate insights from the community's aggregated data (knowledge and wisdom from various sources). These agents can then be coordinated as a swarm, in ways that give people access to the collected knowledge and wisdom from across a whole network of communities.

Unlike closed models that perpetuate opacity and exclusivity, these agent networks will be specifically designed to be a bridge between communities, where all beings and all stories, including from underrepresented sources, are not just welcome, but are essential.

The system empowers communities to maintain full ownership of their data while participating in meaningful knowledge-sharing networks. By building infrastructure for decentralized data interoperability, we aim to create a regenerative and equitable process for knowledge creation that nurtures collective intelligence, respecting diverse needs while ensuring ethical engagement and mutual benefit.

### 

### Please describe the why behind your project. Why are you building this project now? \*

1 / 3000

The convergence of climate urgency, AI innovation, and decentralized technology presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform how humanity could bridge gaps in climate coordination and address the climate crisis together.

Recent breakthroughs in open-source AI agents and crypto infrastructure have made decentralized knowledge sharing not just theoretically possible, but practically achievable. While traditional approaches to data interoperability typically require surrendering control to central authorities, our approach maintains community sovereignty through crypto rails and agent-mediated sharing. The network effects of many small, sovereign agents working in concert could potentially surpass the capabilities of a few large centralized systems.

**Stakeholder Benefits**

This project offers multiple tangible benefits to participating organizations and communities:

**Data Sovereignty:** Communities maintain complete control over their data, determining what is shared and how it is used. This sovereignty extends beyond simple access control to include governance over the ways their information can be interpreted and applied.

**Selective Sharing:** Organizations can share specific insights while maintaining privacy and control over sensitive information. The agent-mediated approach allows for nuanced sharing policies that can be adjusted based on context and relationships.

**Economic Opportunity:** Communities can potentially earn income from their knowledge sharing, creating sustainable models for community-driven information exchange. This represents a shift from traditional extractive models to one where value flows back to knowledge creators.

**Enhanced Collaboration:** The agent network enables more efficient collaboration across organizations, reducing the friction typically associated with cross-organizational knowledge sharing. This efficiency is achieved without requiring organizations to compromise their autonomy or data sovereignty.

**Reduced Complexity:** By using AI agents to mediate data sharing, we significantly reduce the technical complexity traditionally associated with data interoperability projects. This makes sophisticated knowledge sharing accessible to a broader range of organizations, regardless of their technical capabilities.

**Democratic Access:** The system provides democratic access to AI capabilities, ensuring that advanced technology serves the needs of communities rather than merely extracting value from them. This democratization is essential for ensuring that the benefits of AI advancement are broadly distributed.

### If you received $100,000 tomorrow, how would your project use it to scale and grow? \*

1 / 3000

The **$100,000** grant could be allocated as follows:

1. **Core Swarming Protocols ($30,000)**:

   Develop the foundational infrastructure that enables AI agents to communicate, coordinate, and share knowledge across the swarm.

2. **AI Agent Deployment ($20,000)**:

   Create and train AI agents tailored to the needs of pilot communities, focusing on climate adaptation and resilience.

3. **Zero-Knowledge Proof Implementation ($40,000)**:

   Enable secure, privacy-preserving data sharing.

4. **Community Onboarding and Training ($10,000)**:

   Develop resources to help communities understand, adopt, and optimize the use of AI agents.

### 

**Implementation Approach**

Our approach combines proven technical frameworks with practical implementation strategies, supported by an established network of partnerships and identified funding pathways. This comprehensive strategy ensures we can move from concept to execution efficiently while maintaining our commitment to community sovereignty and ethical knowledge gathering.

**Technical Architecture** 

Underpinning the concept of the Infinite Front Porch is what we describe as a crypto-enabled, local first, AI agent Swarm: 

- **_Crypto-enabled_**_ - utilizing blockchain and zero knowledge proof technologies to secure and permission data._

- **_Local-first_**_ - data is kept "locally" under the control of the community group/organization, not given over to a third party._ 

- **_AI agent_**_ - pieces of software that leverage LLMs to carry out specific purposes. Agents have long-term memory, intent and the ability to take action towards that intent._

- **Swarm** - _a collection of AI agents that can be coordinated, giving users access to the best knowledge, information and functionality possessed by the agents that make up the swarm._ 

	

The technical foundation of our project builds upon existing, battle-tested agent frameworks such as ELIZA, emphasizing modularity and simplicity over complexity. We employ a plugin-based architecture that enables straightforward agent communication while maintaining flexibility for future expansion. This approach allows us to create specialized, focused agents rather than attempting to build monolithic systems, aligning with our vision of distributed, community-oriented knowledge sharing.

Our architecture leverages swarm protocols to facilitate agent-to-agent communication, creating a robust network that can adapt to varying levels of data sharing and sovereignty requirements. 

We leverage a combination of permissionless blockchains and [zero knowledge proof](https://chain.link/education/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp?utm_source=chatgpt.com) technologies to manage the storing and sharing of data within the system. Through this we ensure that governance and ownership structures are embedded at the protocol level, providing genuine sovereignty rather than merely superficial control. These technologies allow for granular control of permissions and data ownership as well as censorship protections for communities participating in an agent swarm.  

For knowledge management, we utilize established documentation tools such as GitBook, allowing us to build upon existing infrastructure rather than creating entirely new systems. This approach reduces technical barriers to entry while ensuring compatibility with current organizational practices.

### How will your project scale its impact? What will your impact be in 5 years? 10 years? \*

1 / 3000

Our implementation follows a measured, iterative approach beginning with a small network of three to four partner organizations. This initial phase will focus on internal testing using the Super Benefit knowledge base, allowing us to refine our methodologies before expanding to additional partners. Through this process, we will develop comprehensive playbooks and documentation, creating a clear pathway for future organizations to join the network.

A key innovation in our approach is the development of agents capable of deploying other agents, streamlining the onboarding process for new organizations. This self-replicating capability, combined with our focus on practical experimentation and iterative development, enables us to scale efficiently while maintaining quality and consistency.

Our methodology emphasizes learning through doing, with each deployment providing valuable insights that feed back into our development process. This approach ensures that our solutions remain grounded in practical reality while continuously evolving to meet community needs.

In one potential scenario:

In **5 years**, the Infinite Front Porch will have scaled to include hundreds of communities across multiple regions. Each community will have its own locally governed AI agent, contributing to a decentralized knowledge network. By leveraging the positive network effects of swarming protocols, the project will:

- Establish a robust ecosystem of regenerative projects powered by AI-enabled coordination.

- Launch thousands of climate initiatives rooted in local needs and global insights.

- Establish a proven, replicable model for decentralized data sharing and knowledge sovereignty, with metrics tracking the number of queries resolved and shared climate solutions adopted globally.

-  Integrate regenerative finance mechanisms, ensuring ongoing financial sustainability and scaling opportunities for grassroots projects within the network.

In **10 years**, the Infinite Front Porch will have become a cornerstone of climate resilience efforts, with:

- A global network of interconnected communities co-creating regenerative solutions.

- Local-first AI agents driving data sovereignty and equitable knowledge sharing.

- A proven, replicable model for scaling climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives.

- Transition from a pilot initiative to a critical infrastructure for climate resilience, serving as a decentralized replacement for centralized data monopolies. 

- Facilitate cross-regional collaboration, policy influence, and community-driven innovations.

The long-term vision is a resilient, decentralized network that transforms how we address climate challenges, creating a world where communities collaborate to regenerate ecosystems and adapt to a changing climate.

By combining technical innovation, decentralized governance, and a focus on local-first solutions, the project aims to redefine how climate challenges are addressed collaboratively at both the local and global levels.

  - The program connected with and engaged **XXX** across 6 different sessions exploring different topics and technologies

Experiment - Using crypto based privacy payments for grant-making

  -  The RPP team are supporting a large international funder to develop a method of transferring international payments to smaller regional funders using secure and private crypto payments. 

  - This is supporting local communities who might be at risk of persecution‚Äìfrom governments and other hostile groups‚Äìto receive and distribute payments without the risks and costs they currently face. 

## Funding Rounds

_NOTE: To be clear, what we mean by "funding rounds" in this context is NOT whether your group will require more funding rounds to continue operations, but whether your project will run funding rounds or distribute funds to your user population--i.e., give them money by repurposing our funds._

### Does your project plan to _run_ funding rounds (vs. continuing to NEED more funding rounds to continue the project) or distribute funding? \*

- Yes

- **No**

- Maybe/unsure

### I confirm that my project is not: \*

- **Running grant rounds, or distribute funding, for a mechanism that involves users voting.**

### Anything else you'd like us to know?

The AI swarm project represents a transformative leap in how communities coordinate and share knowledge to combat the climate crisis. Our focus on data sovereignty, decentralized governance, and local-first AI agents ensures that solutions are co-created with and by communities, respecting their autonomy and unique contexts.

The Infinite Front Porch builds on the proven success of the Reimagining Power Project (RPP), leveraging its frameworks to scale regenerative coordination at a global level. By combining AI and Web3 technologies, we aim to bridge gaps between global knowledge and local action, catalyzing climate resilience worldwide.

Our commitment is not just to build technology but to create an ecosystem where communities thrive as active participants in a decentralized, regenerative future. Your support will enable us to scale this vision and co-create a global network of empowered, climate-resilient communities.

The RPP is deeply committed to creating a knowledge commons that supports decentralized systems and collective action. This commitment is exemplified in the **SuperBenefit Knowledge Base**, which has laid the foundation for the next phase of the project, the Infinite Front Porch. By prioritizing well-structured, locally controlled, and networked knowledge, this system ensures that data is easy for AI to parse and understand, unlocking powerful new opportunities for collaboration and insight generation.

#### **Key Features of the Knowledge Base**

- **Local-First**: All content is stored as markdown files on contributors' devices, enabling autonomy and secure collaboration.

- **Networked Knowledge**: Information is connected through wiki-links, metadata, and tags, allowing relationships between ideas to emerge organically, improving AI's ability to generate meaningful insights.

- **Balance of Public and Private**: By combining a private workspace with a public knowledge garden, the system respects the iterative nature of knowledge development while fostering open sharing.

The structured, relational design of the Knowledge Base directly supports the Infinite Front Porch by providing well-organized data that AI agents in the swarm can easily access, process, and contextualize. This approach is critical for enabling the swarm to connect disparate knowledge sources and create actionable insights for climate resilience and regenerative coordination.

#### **RPP Progress to Date** 

1. **Decentralized Governance Models**: Developed and tested governance primitives for enabling participatory decision-making and resource allocation.

2. **Collaborative Playbooks**: Created open-source frameworks for decentralized coordination and collective intelligence, offering replicable models for community empowerment.

3. **Regenerative Partnerships**: Partnered with the Equality Fund, GreenPill Network, ReFi DAO, OpenCivics, BioFi, and others to explore intersections of decentralized finance, governance, and regenerative ecosystems.

4. **Stakeholder Mapping & Gatherings Program**: Identified opportunities for collaboration across Web3, philanthropy, and regenerative initiatives, and co-hosted a series of 6 online gatherings to build a community of practice

5. **Publications and Knowledge Sharing**: Published resources, such as "Reimagining Power: How Web3 Can Transform Social Impact" and a series of Mirror posts, and contributed to research in other DAOs and projects.
