## Experiments

### AIFS

Focus: Exploring a network governance structure for AIFS. We'll be helping to craft a narrative around Gatherings and building opportunities for sharing and co-ownership.

The AIFS gatherings have confirmed funding through Canadian Tire and OTF. The decentralized authority structure is being developed for managing these gatherings.

Timeline: Monthly Gatherings to run from November to March. Need to set dates and plan a timeline for getting the Gatherings set up

Next Steps:

- Meeting Monday to review gathering agenda

- Continue planning for first gathering

Participants: AIFS, SB, OTF, JumpStart, Women Win, Ready Sport, Calgary Parks, potentially Krause House.

Calgary Parks are being looped into the gatherings and see where this guides us. We will use this as an opportunity to evolve the AIFS governance in general as it changes its shape.

### Equality Fund

Discovery Report is completed. Team preparing to share high-level overview of approach at upcoming stakeholder meeting.

Timeline: Fall/Winter, potentially identified.

Information: Sue has shared details on their allocation system. She has an idea for an experiment doing participatory grantmaking in parallel.

Next Steps:

- Share document with Sue before stakeholder meeting

- Schedule follow-up detailed discussion

- Continue developing experiment framework

### Institute for Community Sustainability

"Initial stakeholder mapping and sense-making around the Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) have begun. Discussions are focused on developing a DAO-like structure to guide future initiatives."

Parallel Work: Developing resources for local node experiments to support, potentially through the playbooks project, which could provide guidelines for establishing DAO-style local nodes.

Direction: This could be an impactful direction, particularly in federations of local nodes coordinating across communities.
