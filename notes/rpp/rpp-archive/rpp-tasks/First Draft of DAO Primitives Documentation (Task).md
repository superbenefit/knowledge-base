_Drafting documentation for using DAO primitives in the Reimagining Power project at SuperBenefit._

# Purpose

Experimentation with DAO primitives is a central theme of the Reimagining Power project. RPP requires internal knowledge resources on this topic. This task will provide these resources for the purpose of informing the RPP Core Team and Stakeholders as we conduct web3 experiments.

## Expected Outputs / Goals

During phase 1, this workstream will produce a conceptual framework for engaging with DAO tooling, along with some simple design patterns and facilitation guides for engaging with the referenced tools & practices.

Once this task is complete, RPP contributors will have the knowledge resources they need to understand and engage in strategy conversations that include the DAO primitives as they will be leveraged in the experiments/activities.
