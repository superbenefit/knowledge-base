Onboarding is about welcoming and guiding new members into the Reimagining Power Project, ensuring they have the tools, resources, and understanding necessary to contribute effectively. 

The **Community Weaver** helps manage the onboarding flow, from initial introductions to more in-depth orientation. This includes ensuring that every newcomer is paired with a supportive mentor a.k.a an **Onboarding Buddy**, and assisting new contributors in navigating the project's decentralized environment. 

The goal is to reduce barriers to participation by providing clear instructions, offering personalized support during onboarding calls, and helping newcomers identify their first tasks or projects. The onboarding process should leave new contributors feeling confident, connected, and excited to get involved.
