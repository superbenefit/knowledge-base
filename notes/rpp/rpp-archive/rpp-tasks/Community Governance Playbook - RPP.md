# Purpose

`The purpose of this work as it relates to the RP project.`

RPP stakeholders have a particular interest in various modalities of community governance, and want more information about possibilities for using web3 tech to implement and augment community governance systems.

Since our stakeholders operate at various scales and perform different types of work (funding/grantmaking, field building, local organizing, finance, etc.), we need to create a comprehensive resource which conveys all of the relevant community governance patterns and how they are useful to different types of organizations and communities. 

## Expected Outputs / Goals

`The deliverables or outcomes needed from this work`

To help our stakeholders, their network peers and the wider social impact space understand and use these ideas/tools, we must make a playbook to convey all of the relevant information in an accessible manner. These Playbooks will contain **patterns**, which are separate documents focusing on a specific solution space. The playbook will help the reader understand how patterns may be useful to them within the given context (Community Governance).

- **Community Governance Playbook**

  - Core Patterns

    - Related Primitives

    - Case Studies

  - Lexicon Entries

  - (documented) External Links

Of special interest is how these systems can be composed to coordination flows of resources (including information) across various, differing types of organizational/civic scales, property relations, production modalities, governance systems and other social constructs using open protocols and decentralized, peer-to-peer networks.

## Scope of Work

`What will this work cover? What domains of activity are involved?`

- Planning the playbook and its content

- Creating draft content for the playbook

  - Create content for patterns, case studies, etc

  - Component review, collab and substantive editing

  - Playbook composition & copy editing

- Assembling / proofing the playbook and related assets

  - 

### Exclusions

`What will this work not cover? What will be excluded from this workstream?`

- Coordinating the high-level content requirements for the playbook (core pattern selection, house style, etc)

- Publishing the playbook outside of the knowledge garden (to print, pdf, etc.) and related design requirements

# Practice

## Contributors

**Playbook Contributors** work on playbooks and related deliverables. Contributors may propose and/or claim playbook tasks, and are responsible for setting norms related to the production of deliverables.

- All contributors may join the playbook cell and receive 1 vote by making a proposal to the cell. 

  -  Contributors who don't intend to do any more work in the cell should quit. Quitting will not effect your eligibility for future retrospective rewards (if any).

- You don't need to join the cell to work on contributors and receive bounties. If there is an open bounty you'd like to fulfill as a solo merc, just ask a steward to assign you the task.

  - You may need to share some parts of the task with the steward if you're not in the workgroup, since you'll likely be missing some crucial context. It may be easier to just join the group.

**Playbook Stewards** provide coordination and support functions for playbook contributors, like task management, budgeting, payments, etc.. Stewards are able to transact RPP's playbook loot and vote as delegates of the core team. 

- Stewards work on playbooks as contributors. You can ask them for help with deliverables or anything else.

- Stewards can create, propose and payout rewards for tasks. The easiest way to get a task and get paid is to talk to a steward.

  - Stewards have a lot of delegated voting weight and access to RPP's loot, so they can make (or break) quorum on proposals. Ask a steward if you need help sponsoring or passing one.

  - They don't have any special privileges in the cell though, so you'll still need to talk with your teammates to make collective decisions about working agreements. Stewards won't vote for an unpopular or surprise proposal (and might vote against it).

  - Stewards _can_ ragequit the core team's loot in the case of a malicious proposal. This will cause the proposal to fail and seriously harsh the vibe, so don't do submit bad proposals.

**RPP Core Team** (facilitated by stewards) are responsible for aligning the high-level content plan with the needs of the Reimagining Power project and communicating with external stakeholders.

- Core Team members work on deliverables and are encouraged to participate as contributors if they have the capacity to do so.

- By default, core team votes sit in the RPP safe and are delegated to a steward (Rowan).

## Resources

`What resources may be needed for this work?`

- **Playbooks Cell**

  - Operational governance of the playbooks workgroup will be conducted by the playbooks cell, which has the following resources available

    - [Governance Contract](https://admin.daohaus.club/#/molochv3/0xa/0xe80ffca045bf338cb088b8fb635130431ec6f976)

    - #rp-playbooks Discord channel

    - [Charmverse task board](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/playbooks-rpp-7896050492098612)

- Playbooks Budget

  - Work on playbooks is funded using Playbook Loot, which is backed 1:1 with USDC in the playbooks treasury

  - Unspent playbook loot is held in the RP Treasury. Stewards and core team members can transact playbook loot

- [Knowledge Base](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base)

  - Deliverables from this project will be recorded in the knowledge base, which is a Quartz vault hosted on GitHub.

  - Contributors can use the vault to compose playbooks.

## Information and Transparency

`What do you need to manage information related to this work in a transparent way?`

- All working agreements, recommended practices and other important information is stored in the [cell state document](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/playbooks-rpp-7896050492098612).

- All information related to votes, treasury funds and other governance matters are held in the [governance interface](https://admin.daohaus.club/#/molochv3/0xa/0xe80ffca045bf338cb088b8fb635130431ec6f976).

- All outputs and related content is stored in the [knowledge base](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base).

These resources are visible to all SuperBenefit members and can be inspected at any time. To modify the content of these documents, post a thread in the #rp-playbooks channel on Discord. A steward will assist if a proposal or other governance action is needed.

# Progress

## Work Items

- Working documents can be stored in Charmverse for collaborative editing. Workers can compose content wherever they want.

- Outputs are recorded in the knowledge base. If you have a finished output to record, you can do it yourself or ask a steward for help.

Introduction / Summary

## Context & Orientation

- This section helps the reader understand community governance and its uses, benefits, etc.
- Community Governance is itself a pattern, so this content can be derived from that document.
	- If the pattern doesn't exist yet, coordinate with the DAO Cell playbook stream to create it.
- This is somewhat strategic for SuperBenefit, so Stewards will probably do this part in collaboration with stakeholders.
