# Purpose

To deliver on the agreed purpose and goals of the RPP with respect to the development of the DAO Primitives.

To move the DAO primitives forward from theory and high-level design, to practical application that can be utilised beyond SuperBenefit. Do this by running practical experiments that improve and evolve the Design, Facilitation and Implementation of these web3 governance patterns. 

## Expected Outputs / Goals

1. High-level DAO primitives in a sharable form

2. Facilitation - schemas, templates, tooling (hats, charmverse etc)

3. Implementation - hands on experiments in collaboration with the other RPP workstreams and in partnership with RPP stakeholders and others

4. Playbook - contributions to the Playbook documenting the the above and into shareable patterns that can be utilised by others

## Scope of Work

**Phase 1 (Preparation)**

1. High-level outline of the DAO primitives - create a shareable doc that lays out the DAO primitives framework in a way that the RP team and others can easily understand and engage with.


1. Fleshing out the DAO primitives design

2. Designing written core docs that can be shared


1. Create a Facilitation / exploration framework (for/with stakeholders)

2. Create a starter library of design patterns, simple instructions for implementing patterns


**Phase 2 (Execution)**

1. Facilitation - social patterns and technical modules


1. Creating the social infrastructure - fleshing out and using the schemas and templates that can be used to put the primitives into action to deliver on a limited set of selected web3 governance patterns. Possible patterns including


1. Creating and coordinating a Cell - Cell state, tasks, roles, creating new Cells etc


1. Possibly use this in an experiment with AIFS 


1. Partnership model/pattern - creating a partnership between a DAO and other orgs using the primitives (e.g the RPP)

2. The 2 house governance pattern 


1. Possibly use the revamp of SB governance as the use case for this


1. Composing the technical tooling to deliver the selected web3 governance patterns  


1. Implementation - operationalising the above into experiments where they can be tested. 

2. Playbook - in partnership with other RPP workstreams taking Design, Facilitation and Implementation learning and artefacts and building out "Plays" that others can use to implement the defined web3 governance patterns. 

### Exclusions

# Practice

- The DAO primitives team will hold the bulk of the strategy and planning for this work stream. 


## Contributors

- Writing and information design

- Research and insight into power dynamics in Philanthropy relationships

- Web3 governance technologies

- Project management for experiments 


## Resources

- Funding for core contributors (yet to be scoped)

- Funding to incentivise outside contributors (yet to be scoped)

## Information and Transparency

# Progress

- We have a lot of the high-level design of the primitives 

- We ave experiments already running inside SuperBenefit and AIFS as well as the governance design for the RPP

## Pace & Milestones

- 1. Getting the core high-level primitives well defined so they can be communicated as a starting point (in process)

- 2.
