### **Project Summary (200 words max)**

_Explain the work and its significance._

The Infinite Front Porch project is building decentralized, community-controlled AI agent swarms that enable grassroots organizations to retain data sovereignty, engage in secure knowledge-sharing, and govern AI on their own terms. Current AI models concentrate control in centralized systems, extracting value from communities while limiting their ability to set ethical and operational boundaries. We are building an alternative AI infrastructure, where each community operates its own AI agents with granular privacy controls enabled by zero-knowledge (zk) proofs.

Each AI agent functions as a local-first knowledge steward, able to surface insights from a community’s own data without requiring centralized data pooling. Agents can selectively share information across a swarm, coordinating with other agents through a coordination protocol that preserves privacy while unlocking the benefits of decentralized knowledge exchange.

Infinite Front Porch builds on SuperBenefit's deep experience community coordination and knowledge sharing and is being developed in partnership with leading community knowledge networks  OpenCivics, All In For Sport, GreenPill Network, Coordinape, Crypto Commons Association. Labour DAO, ReFi DAO, BreadChain _- _and other partners in philanthropy and Web3. With a timeline from August 2025 to December 2026 and a $150K USD funding request, the project will implement a first proof of concept with the listed partners. Following a successful proof of concept it will develop open-source tools and templates for other communities to implement their own versions of AI agent swarms.

### **Impact Statement (200 words max)**

_Detail the project's anticipated impact on driving grassroots activation and stakeholder engagement in AI safety._

The Infinite Front Porch directly supports grassroots activation and stakeholder engagement in AI safety by shifting AI governance out of corporate control and into community hands. Instead of a centralized entity deciding how AI operates on behalf of communities, Infinite Front Porch enables nonprofits, foundations, and grassroots organizations to define AI safety frameworks tailored to their needs.

Through local-first AI agents, organizations can govern their own AI models, controlling how their data is used, what information is shared, and how AI-generated insights are applied. This removes the need for organizations to trust external AI providers while still enabling safe and privacy-preserving collaboration across a federated swarm. Zk-proof technology ensure that data can be verified without being exposed, making AI operations transparent while maintaining confidentiality.

This participatory AI governance model establishes a real-world testbed for decentralized AI safety principles. By embedding AI decision-making within grassroots networks, the project helps shape a bottom-up approach to AI oversight, where civil society organizations define ethical constraints, risk mitigation strategies, and governance rules. Infinite Front Porch demonstrates that AI safety is not just a technical problem but a governance challenge—and that solutions must be designed to empower communities rather than extract from them.

### **Track Record (200 words max)**

_Explain previous work, research and qualifications relevant to the proposed project._

The Infinite Front Porch builds on the Reimagining Power Project (RPP), a multi-year research initiative exploring decentralized governance, participatory funding, and ethical AI models. RPP has cultivated partnerships across philanthropy and Web3, working with organizations such as SuperBenefit, OpenCivics, BioFi, and the Equality Fund, providing a strong foundation for deploying community-led AI infrastructures.

Infinite Front Porch decentralizes ownership and control, ensuring that AI systems are governed by and for the communities using them. The project team has worked extensively on Web3-enabled governance primitives, participatory funding models, and federated AI research, developing technical playbooks, privacy-preserving AI frameworks, and real-world AI governance experiments.

By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs and agent swarming protocols, Infinite Front Porch introduces a new paradigm for AI safety—one that is decentralized, privacy-preserving, and controlled at the community level. This approach ensures that grassroots organizations are not just included in AI governance discussions but are actively shaping AI safety policies based on real-world needs.

With the Infinite Front Porch, our team moves from research to implementation, delivering a working prototype of decentralized AI governance that can be replicated and expanded across global civil society networks.

**Resume/Curriculum Vitae**\*

- SuperBenefit

  - SuperBenefit is a 

SuperBenefit's mission is to develop the social and financial flywheels that enable the invention and acceleration of a better world.

SuperBenefit's work includes researching and incubating initiatives that harness emerging technologies and practices in pursuit of systems transformation.

Since 2023, the main focus of our work has been the Reimagining Power Project (RPP), which is exploring how emerging web3 technologies can be leveraged to redistribute power, mobilize capital, and transform systems toward more equitable outcomes. Focusing on decentralized governance models, the project tests new ways of coordinating resources and decision-making to promote social equity, sustainability, and community empowerment

Since the project's inception, we have made significant progress in laying the groundwork for this transformation, building partnerships and coordinating with groups and individuals to strengthen our collective efforts.

Our current research examines community-controlled AI for knowledge sovereignty, piloting federated AI agent swarms that provide locally governed, privacy-preserving, non-extractive AI infrastructures, resisting the corporate enclosure of knowledge by providing practical tools that put community data sovereignty first, ensuring new technologies serve local needs.
