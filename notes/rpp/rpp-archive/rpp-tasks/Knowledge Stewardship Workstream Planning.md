_Scoping the Knowledge Management & Sharing Workstream for the Reimagining Power project at SuperBenefit._

# Purpose

The Knowledge Stewardship workstream will create a strategy for harvesting and curating knowledge from the Reimagining Power projects, create the necessary tooling for doing so, and train contributors in their use.

## Expected Outputs / Goals

This workstream will work to accomplish these specific goals for the Reimagining Power project:

- Harvesting & Curating information and cultural artifacts from SuperBenefit spaces to create rich community resources for contributors and other network members:

  - Moving & updating content from Notion to Charmverse

  - Curating links and other info from Discord, Clarity and other spaces into Charmverse

  - Creating authoring/recording tools for harvesters, curators, storytellers & projects

- Deliver v1 or mockup versions of community-owned publication microsites to facilitate coherent, impactful storytelling experiences, including some or all of:

  - A homepage to showcase Reimagining Power's work and other drops

  - Platforms to store and view streams/recordings of SuperBenefit's Salons

  - Tools to author & publish Playbooks and other documentation as needed

  - Multimedia drops for collaborative multimedia releases sharing a common theme (such as "Reimagining Power")

Contributor engagement & selection strategy will be developed further as workstream scope is refined

## Porosity & Transparency

The Knowledge Stewardship workstream will provide regular updates on progress, including opportunities for training on any new tools deployed. A resource will be created for requesting work and/or assistance from this workstream.

Tasks and Meetings for this workstream will be tagged using the Knowledge Stewardship admin workstream tag. All RPP members will be welcome and encouraged to join this workstream's collaboration spaces and perform tasks.

Most outputs and in-progress work will be located in Charmverse, in the Reimagining Power or Knowledge Stewardship workspaces. All contributors will be able to monitor progress and contribute to these resources as they like.

## Resources

The following resources will be needed for this work:

- Incentives for creators, curators and harvesters who help steward information
