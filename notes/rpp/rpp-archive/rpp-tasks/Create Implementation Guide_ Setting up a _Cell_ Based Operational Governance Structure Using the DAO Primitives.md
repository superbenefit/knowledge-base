This is an one of three implementation guides that will accompany the main playbook output for the RPP (along with community governance and multi-stakeholder governance guides)

### This is a draft Doc that copies over work started in the  

## Context & Orientation

### Introduction 

Crypto primitives give us the opportunity to fundamentally redesign organizational and financial models in ways that are better for individuals, communities and society. This opportunity to reimagine organizations brings with it complexity, as structures and practices that were once fixed become flexible and adaptable. As a result we need to lean on primitives, and patterns for combining these primitives, that we can use to reliably produce organizational structures with the features we want. 

At SuperBenefit we have developed the DAO primitives framework in an attempt to provide a set of primitives and patterns out of with these new organizational structures can be composed. 

We have identified and experimented with using the DAO primitives framework to produce a governance system that is specifically designed to provide a flexible foundation for collaboration between traditional organizations (like philanthropic funders, community organizations and non-profits), and web3 native communities like DAOs and their contributors. This system is based on 3 interlocking governance structures: Community Governance, Operational Governance and Multi-Stakeholder Governance.  

This guide focuses on setting up the Operational Governance piece. Please see the accompanying guides for using the DAO primitives framework to set up corresponding community and multi-stakeholder structures. 

  - **_See guide - Setting up Community Governance Using the DAO Primitives_** 

 **_See guide - Setting up Multi-Stakeholder Governance Using the DAO Primitives_**

For people and organizations wanting to build a web3 enabled governance system, there are many ways to apply the DAO primitives framework and the the different primitives to achieve different governance and operational outcomes. This guide outlines a particular combination of primitives and patterns that we have found to be effective at implementing the transformative governance systems that we are hoping to create. 


**_Consider integrating or deleting -_**_ The overarching pattern we are describing as purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams has a version of community governance (see the Community Governance pattern and the community governance implementation facilitation guide for how to think about and design community governance structures), that wraps an operational governance structure that executes on the the activities of the network._ 

_What this overarching pattern promotes is implementing new forms of governance that are only becoming practical because of web3 technical primitives. Traditional business, charitable and governmental structures are generally run as top-down hierarchies where a few people hold all the power etc etc_

_The invention of digital cryptographic primitives combined with rapid experimentation on how to use these to underpin new ways of organizing and aligning people are creating new opportunities to collaborate and coordinate better. Opportunities to build fairer systems that respect the people that participate in them, that can more intelligently direct their actions towards things that improve the state of the world and the people participating in these systems._ 

_Operational structures tend to be created as rigid hierarchies that are "managed" on behalf of capital holders. This creates liner decision flows, rigid rule-sets and strong focus on extracting more and more efficiency. As a result these operational structures tend to become fixed and static squandering the the creativity and intelligence latent in the people they employ._ 

_The goal of developing operational structure using crypto primitives to create purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams is to create structure that can leverage many of the new dynamics that come out of cutting edge organizational design, complexity science but also recognizes that humans have always sought to collaborate and coordinate in powerful and healthy ways, and that many of these tendencies have been denied to us by the rigid business structures that the world has been obsessed with for the past couple of hundred years._

> Note edit the above to make it shorter and dedupe ideas

Creating an operational governance structure is not a simple task. We recommend getting support from an experienced facilitator to help you through this process.

### **Why the DAO primitives framework** 

The goal of the DAO primitives framework is to allow us to compose governance systems that can produce purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams that have powerful organizational dynamics making these networks effective in solving important problems. 

The process of designing an operational governance structure for a network of small autonomous teams, based on the DAO primitives framework, is that of composing together a set of organizational infrastructures (social and technical) with the goal of producing a set of specific organizational dynamics. These dynamics, then in turn produce system properties that we hope will lead to the sustainability and success of our network. These system properties are the reason we build organizations in Web3. They are the powerful forces that will allow us to solve complex problems and build more a more resilient world.

## Designing Your Operational Governance Structure - Creating & Coordinating Networks of Cells

There are many ways that you can use the DAO primitives to construct a network of operational teams. The particular system that you put together will reflect both the specific realities of the work that the operational structure will perform and the ways in which members of your community want to work together:

- **Highly structured top down decision-making **- if a lot of control is desired (optimizing for operational efficiency over creativity and flexibility) then you would implement a structure that relied on building hierarchies of cells that answer to Cells above them in the hierarchy. Doing this you could build something that resembled a traditional corporate org chart. However if you are looking to implement a governance system based on the DAO primitives, then you probably would not want to just recreate a traditional hierarchy model. You may however have some aspects of the operational governance that operates in more a strictly controlled manner where certain Cells simple do what they are told. 

- **Highly unconstrained networks** - the DAO primitives can also be used to create networks that are maximally autonomous and permissionless. These versions of governance will allow for the free-forming of Cells and trust that they will find ways to coordinate successfully without constraints imposed from the larger network. 

- **A combination of top down and bottom up decision-making** - this is what the DAO primitives framework is designed to facilitate. Being able to build a network that can flexibly use different types of constraints and allowing for more or less autonomy based on the specific operational need being addressed is what unlocks the dynamics and system properties listed above.    


Balancing constraints and autonomy is the key to unlocking the dynamics you want

As well as holding and evolving the purpose of the network, your community governance structure may also mandate certain network-wide constraints that all Cells must meet, like a code of conduct and certain minimum reporting or operational and decision-making requirements (around things like money, communication etc).

But at the same time as having the above structure "imposed" on the network by community governance, Cells in the operational network will have a degree of autonomy and ability to self organize and direct their own actions. 

Cells will also have the ability to impose structure on each other by way of agreements that are made between individual Cells. 

Finding a balance between imposed structure and autonomy for Cells is a key. This balance will determine which of the dynamics (listed above) can be produced by the operational governance structure and therefore which system properties can arise. 

For example:

- Creative and permissionless innovation - tends to be produced by small teams working with maximal autonomy with minimal rigid constraints. 

-  Economies of scale - tend to be produced by scaling hierarchies where teams have less autonomy and constrains enable well understood processes to be executed in more and more efficient ways. **Ref article**

- Decentralized decision-making,  collective/network intelligence and evolving/adapting systems - become possible in operational networks when the decisions of individual Cells (with autonomy) are able to bubble up to influence the strategy of the larger network. **ref article**

Hence when you are designing an operational governance structure it is crucial to understand what kind of network you want. What dynamics and system properties are you trying to produce and therefore what infrastructure (primitives, protocols and practices) will you compose together to produce this? 

   


## Design Steps

1. **Define the purpose and high-level goals of your operational governance structure**

  - **Community purpose** - creating a fit-for-purpose structure requires understanding what the community is trying to achieve and how it wants to achieve it. 

  - If you have an existing community that already has, or can easily create an outline of its purpose, high-level principles, goals, vision for its work and ideas about how it wants to organize itself, then you can jump straight into designing your operational governance model. But if you the community is nascent or not yet able to coherently articulate the above you will need to go through a sense-making process to figure this out.  

  - **Community sense-making -** Work together with community stakeholders to decide on and articulate the above.

**2. Define the requirements of the operational governance structure**

- Based on the above sketch out what qualities does your operational governance need?

  - Do you want to create a large network that will do many different things, or a tight network that will do a few things really well?

  - Do you want the network to be highly efficient, highly flexible or highly creative?

  - Do you want to highly prioritize community engagement and democratic decision-making or should it be tightly controlled by a specific group of stakeholders? 

  - Do you expect large amounts of money to flow through the network?

  - Who are the stakeholder who will participate in the operational network?

  - Are there particularly sensitive people, communities or materials that need to be protected or secured by the operational structure


- Based on the above questions, which organizational dynamics are you going to prioritize?

  - Decentralized decision-making 

  - Autonomy 

  - Creative innovation 

  - Economies of scale

  - Permissionless innovation

  - Flexibility/adaptability  

  - Network effects

  - Fractal scaling 

- Which system properties would you like your network to produce?

  - Collective/network intelligence

  - Evolving/adapting systems

  - Regenerative economics

  - System level impact

**3. Designing your operational model**

- Using the DAO primitives framework design a structure that implements a network of operational Cells. It needs to cover off 3 different levels:

**Community governance level** **(constituency scale)**

1. How community decision-making translates into instructions to be carried out by the operational network

2. What network wide constraints will community governance impose on the operational network

3. Define how resources and value will flow from community governance into the operational network

**Cell coordination level (coordination scale)**

1. How will the operational network connects with the community governance 


1. Perhaps there is a top-level Cell that takes instruction from the community governance structure 

2. Perhaps there are a set of different functional areas of the operational network that each take their instructions from the community governance 


1. How will resources and value will flow through the operational network

2. How will strategy be created?

3. What legal status will the operational governance have?

4. Define what being a member of the operational network will look like. What rights and responsibilities will come with it?

5. What is the initial structure of Cells that is needed to instantiate the operational governance structure e.g


1. What are the core functions of the operational network? What initial Cells will deliver these

2. What is the mechanism for creating new Cells

**Cell level (collaboration scale)**

1. What are the minimum information standards (state) that will be expected of Cells in the network?

2. Are there any templates or archetypal Cell types that will standardize the creation and structure of new Cells in the network?


**Sense-making tools**

- You can use a tool like The Ready's OS Canvas as a starting point for thinking about how you want the operational governance system to work. It can help you think through and discuss different aspects of how your operational governance will work in order to answer the above questions.

## **Implementation Steps**

When you have a clear idea of how you want your operational governance to work it is time to implement it both organizationally (with protocols, practices etc) and technically (with technical tools and modules).  

The DAO primitives contains a set of primitives structures that you can use to implement the governance structure you have decided on. 

1. **DAOs** - the larger constituency scale community container that the operational governance operates inside

2. **Cells** - the basic operational unit in a DAO - a small autonomous team.

3. **Roles** - which contain and manage specific responsibilities and sets of permissions 

4. **Tasks** - which are defined pieces of work/deliverable that an individual, team or other entity can engage with and commit to delivering.


**Group Phase** - each DAO, Cell, Role or Task can move through a **group phase** lifecycle. 

**Group State** - each primitive contains a version of **s****tate**–an articulation of the core relevant information about the DAO, Cell, Role or Task that allows it to be treated as a discrete entity that is addressable across the network.

Build out an operational structure using Cells, Roles and Tasks.

**Cells**

- Teams of people working towards specific goals.

- Using Cell state to record and manage team decisions and activities and to interface with others in the network.

- Using Roles to manage specific ongoing accountabilities and activities

- Using Tasks to manage specific deliverables

**Roles and Tasks** 

Can be used within Cells (as above) but can also be used across the operational network to manage accountabilities and deliverables. E.g a Cell may pick up a particular Task or Role created by another Cell, or individuals in the network may also pick them up. A Cell may create roles or tasks so that they can coordinate contributions from members of the operational network who are not part of their Cell, or to manage its own members and deliverables. 

Use the following patterns and templates to understand how to design the initial Cells needed for the operational network. 

1. Cell-working-group

2. Cell-state

3. Cell-state-template

Use the following patterns and templates for creating Roles and Tasks

1. .

2. .

3. .


Consider modifying the Cell, Role or Task templates to use for the creation of Cells, Roles and Tasks in your operational network. Include in these templates any governance or operational features that you want to ensure are included across your operational network

 

**Technical implementation**

Implementing the above design will require several different tools. Here are some of the categories of tools and examples of particular tools. 

1. **Knowledge repository** -  where information about the operational network can be articulated shared e.g:


1. Charmverse, Notion, Google Docs


1. **Cell state repository** - a mechanism for containing and updating Cell state. Ideally editor controlled and version controlled but accessible to the network.


1. Shared information platforms e.g  Gitbook Charmverse, Notion


1. **Proposal creation and voting tools**


1. Charmverse, Snapshot


1. **Token based authority and access tools** - to manage access to communication channels, access to documents, voting rights etc


1. Hats protocol


1. **Communication platforms** - communication will happen at different scales - from within individual Cells (collaboration), to operational networks (coordination), to the larger community (constituency). You need to choose either one platform to do all of it or a combination of several different platforms. 


1. Discord is useful because it can be set up to cover all three scales by creating a structure of different channels each with granular access control


1. **Treasury management** - the operational network will need to secure and manage the flow of resources to operational Cells in the network.


1. Safe - multisig wallet infra

### **Launch & Evolution**

- Phased Implementation: Outline stages for rolling out the governance structure. Use the concept of group phase to implement your governance structure in a evolutionary way, formalizing Cells and other primitives as they are ready, rather than forcing a completed governance design in one go. 

- Feedback Mechanisms: Define how the system will gather and respond to input. You will need to implement ways for the network to reflect on how the governance model is working.  

- Adaptation Processes: Establish how the structure will evolve over time. You will need to have mechanisms to propose and make changes to the governance model in response to insights coming through the feedback mechanisms you have put in place.  


## Getting Help

As mentioned above, the process of developing an operational governance structure can be a complex one. This is especially true when you are trying to design operational governance for an existing network–starting something new can allow you to start small and iterate, where as redesigning operational governance for something that is already up and running is much harder. 

We recommend that you utilize the support of an experienced facilitator to help you through the process. Get in touch with folks in SuperBenefitDAO to find someone to help you navigate the journey. This will make the process much faster and less time consuming.
