The Reimagining Power Project (RPP), a project of SuperBenefit DAO, explores how web3 technologies can decentralize power, mobilize capital, and promote equitable systems. One key initiative of the RPP is the Gatherings program - interactive, participatory events fostering collaboration, strategic exploration, and community engagement within the web3 and philanthropy ecosystems.

We are currently in Phase 1 of the Gatherings program, which runs until March 2025 in collaboration with All In For Sport DAO, with funding from the Ontario Trillium Foundation and Canadian Tire’s Jumpstart Foundation. We would love to invite you to participate in these ongoing events, which explore participatory governance, decentralized decision-making, and more.

Looking ahead, we are excited to begin Phase 2 in early 2025 in partnership with Open Civics and Gitcoin. This phase will tackle big questions in decentralized governance, on-chain capital allocation, and public goods funding. We’re thrilled to continue working with these partners and hope to bring on additional co-sponsors and collaborators, including within the Octant ecosystem, to enhance the reach and impact of these gatherings.

The RPP is also advancing other transformative work, including creating open-source playbooks to help organizations implement decentralized governance and conducting experiments to explore innovative governance frameworks and resource mobilization strategies.

A pitch deck about Phase 1 of the Gatherings program is attached and [here is an update on the RPP](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/kLXz9vMGA9Au3y3Ug2VoHDLNWJwId66Hmm39vuF9ntE) to provide additional context.

We’re reaching out to explore if Golem might be interested in co-sponsoring Phase 2 of the Gatherings program. Could you let us know if there is a formal process for sponsorship requests? Even if sponsorship isn’t possible, we would love to discuss ways you could participate in this growing initiative.
