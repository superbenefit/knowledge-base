The progress of the OS Stewards so far can be summarized as follows:
Overall Focus:

The OS Stewards have been primarily focused on establishing clear structures and roles to ensure effective collaboration and decision-making within the team. The meetings have revolved around creating a framework that allows for shared responsibility, agency, and self-management among the stewards, while also ensuring that the broader core team remains engaged and informed.
Key Points of Progress:

```
Team Structure & Role Definition:
    The OS Stewards discussed and began to establish a smaller, more focused group to handle operational and strategic decisions. This group, referred to as the "Operations and Strategy Stewards," is intended to centralize operational efforts temporarily, allowing for efficient decision-making and progress on key projects.
    They are working on crafting specific roles within this smaller team, including defining responsibilities, decision-making authority, and compensation structures.

Clarification of Responsibilities:
    The team has emphasized the importance of clarity around responsibilities, eligibility, and accountability within these roles. There is a focus on ensuring that those taking on these roles have the necessary capacity and are held accountable for their commitments.

Decision-Making & Project Management:
    Discussions have been held on how to structure decision-making processes, manage projects effectively, and ensure smooth collaboration within the team. This includes setting up meeting schedules, defining commitments, and establishing a proposal for how the team will function as an official operating entity.
    The stewards have also explored the idea of having a discretionary budget that allows them to make operational decisions without needing constant approval from the broader core team, thus speeding up the process.

Reflection & Adaptation:
    There is a recognition that this structure is a trial and will be reassessed after a set period (likely a month) to determine its effectiveness. The team is open to making adjustments based on what they learn during this period, with the goal of finding the best way to manage their operations and strategy moving forward.
```

Challenges:

```
The stewards are aware of the potential challenges of having a smaller team handle significant responsibilities. They are actively considering how to maintain engagement and ensure that the broader core team remains involved and supportive of the decisions being made.
```

Next Steps:

```
Finalizing the role definitions and gaining approval from the core team.
Implementing the proposed structure and beginning the work with the newly defined roles.
Conducting a reflection session after the initial period to evaluate the success of the structure and make any necessary adjustments.
```

In summary, the OS Stewards have made significant progress in setting up a framework that will allow for more efficient and effective operations. They are moving forward with a clear plan but remain open to adaptation as they learn from this initial phase.
