From previous conversations:

> Salons are interactive and participatory **online** gatherings designed to nurture a networked community of learning and collaboration. They serve as dynamic spaces for strategic exploration, knowledge sharing, and partnership building. Unlike traditional presentations, Salons prioritize co-learning and co-creation, aiming to build a continuously evolving resource or "curriculum" that reflects the community's collective expertise and interests.
