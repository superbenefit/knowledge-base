We can use this task as the place to develop the plan with Spencer and put a budget on it

- Possibly ask Spencer to develop the quartz instance and set of visual design elements for all of the knowledge garden that we can use for the playbooks as well 


Older notes

- Create a playbooks set of visual assets and templates for presentation of final playbooks 

- Greenpill is a good example to work from

- Perhaps someone from the GreenPill Writers Guild would be a good option. 

  - E.g  Octavian Todurut who did the GreenPill visual assets

- Have these ready before the end of December so that playbook authors can utilize them in the new year for final publication of playbooks
