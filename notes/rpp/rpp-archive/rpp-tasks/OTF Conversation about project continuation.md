# Purpose

- The goal of this task is to send a report to OTF to advise them of project progress and request further funding to continue the RPP beyond its current timeline and scope 

- The report should include:

  - what we've done in the project so far (list deliverables, with links if possible + report on progress, challenges, achievements)

    - Include network weaving

      - Weaving networks around AIFS including: 

        - Equality Fund

        - Women Win

      - Coordination around knowledge commons and playbooks across 

        - OpenCivics

        - Open Protocol Research Group

        - Green Pill

        - BioFi

      - lots of projects are colliding with similar ideas :)

  - outline what we're working on currently	

  - outline the partnerships & synergies (eg opencivics, other contributors we've engaged)

  - what we would use additional funds for

    - further experiments, further playbooks and gatherings (can keep it fairly vague)

  - Purpose, what we have delivered, this is what is underway, what do we want to do next.

# Recommended Practices

- Core Team is responsible for this task

- We could ask for 50-75-100k

- need to move on this ASAP. get a 45-min call with Tracey & Doug in the calendar within the next 4 weeks and then work to produce a report to share with them in advance of meeting

- Refer to OTF partnership aims & goals

  - How OTF communicated the initial RPP partnership ([source](https://otf.ca/news/4-partnership-projects-will-help-build-sector-capacity))

    - Web3 and Systems Transformation: This partnership will experiment with the design of three self-governing organizations to bring greater inclusion and collaboration to social impact work. This approach creates new and unique organizational models that are decentralized, autonomous and function without any central control. Also known as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), they are built on top of blockchain technologies using a type of Web3 tool.

    - The Partnership Investments program mobilizes relationships and resources to enable a more resilient and sustainable non-profit sector in Ontario.

 Integral to OTFâ€™s Grant Investment Framework, the program supports multi-stakeholder partnerships with the non-profit, public, and private sectors to build a stronger non-profit sector in Ontario. â€‹Each partnership aligns with one of the programâ€™s Priorities Areas and has expected results and value for Ontarioâ€™s non-profit sector.

    - **Priority areas:** The Partnership Investments program mobilizes relationships and resources to strengthen the sector in four priority areas and in ways that no one partner can do alone. Through different types of partnership activities, we strategically work towards our long-term goals in the following four areas.

      - Inclusive and resilient sector: Build a sector that is resilient, adaptive, and inclusive.

      - Data and learning: Support the sector in its need for data, learning, and action.

      - New sources of capital: Build a stronger community social finance system to support the sector.

        - With partners, OTF will achieve the following outcomes:

          - Strengthen social finance infrastructure and intermediaries.

          - Increase access to capital in new and different ways to build the financial sustainability of the sector. 

        - This can result in:

          - Improved capacity of intermediaries to sustain delivery of place-based social finance funds.

          - New and more strategic methods and approaches for mobilizing capital in support of community-led work.

          - Greater equity in the flow of capital in support of social impact work. 

        - As social finance systems grow, communities will benefit as capital flows in new and more equitable ways.

      - Social research and development (R&D): Help the sector use social R&D methods to deepen community impact.

# Progress Tracking

- This task is complete once a conversation with Doug & Tracey has taken place

## Sub-Tasks

- [x] Contact Tracey to set up a meeting with Michelle & Heenal - Nov 4, 2024

- [ ] Draft a report/briefing note:  

- [ ] Core Team give feedback on the briefing note

- [ ] Send briefing note to Tracey ahead of meeting

## Outcomes

- Tracey is aware of project progress and partnerships. OTF knows that the team wants to continue the RPP and grow it and that more funds are required to do this (whether or not OTF can help with this).

## Review

- Will be reviewing by Core Team

PURPOSE

To explore how web3 can shift power, transform systems and shape better futures. In particular, how the concept of DAOs as purpose driven networks of small autonomous teams can redistribute power, value flows and resources across society at scale.

WHAT ARE WE TESTING AND EXPLORING?

Key Questions: What does web3 uniquely enable to shift power and transform systems? What new models does web3 offer for mobilizing and distributing capital toward transformative outcomes? Where might web3 provide the greatest leverage for catalyzing systemic change?

HIGH LEVEL GOALS

mobilizing philanthropic practices that are transparent, participatory, community-first and that test new collaborative governance models recognizing fundersâ€™ role beyond funding and financial capital unlocking collective intelligence enabling infrastructure and tooling co-learning and peer support storytelling, knowledge sharing and narrative shifting

## Introduction

The Reimagining Power Project (RPP) (submitted as web3 and systems transformation project) was launched with the goal of exploring how emerging web3 technologies can be leveraged to redistribute power, mobilize capital, and transform systems toward more equitable outcomes. By focusing on decentralized governance models, the project aims to test new ways of coordinating resources and decision-making to promote social equity, sustainability, and community empowerment.

The RPP explores how to:

- Shift power from centralized entities to communities through participatory governance and decentralized coordination.

- Mobilize capital in more distributed, equitable ways that prioritize grassroots and community-led initiatives.

- Create and share open-source playbooks that enable others to replicate and build upon these governance models in their own contexts.

- Weave networks across organizations that share similar goals, fostering collaboration and the exchange of knowledge and resources.

Since the projectâ€™s inception, we have made significant progress in laying the groundwork for this transformation, building partnerships and coordinating with groups and individuals to strengthen our collective efforts.

We are seeking additional funding to expand the scope of the RPP, to deepen these collaborations, continue network weaving, host more gatherings, run more experiments, and develop playbooks to scale access to and engagement with decentralized governance models.

## Progress to date

- Weaving narratives across web3 public goods, traditional philanthropy, Bioregional Finance, Sport for social good which can converge to create more collaborative environments for the creation of novel approaches to civic coordination, community resilience and knowledge sharing.

  - stakeholder mapping

  - coordinating & network weaving

    - eg what are playbooks and what should they look like
