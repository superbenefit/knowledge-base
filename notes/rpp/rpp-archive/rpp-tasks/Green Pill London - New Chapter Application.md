## 1 What’s your background and occupation? What experience do you have with web3, regenerative actions and public goods?\*

I am a social entrepreneur, regenerative finance advocate, and community builder, originally from England and now based in London, Ontario, Canada. My work focuses on collective action, systems change, decentralized governance, and regenerative economics, with an emphasis on building thriving, interdependent communities.

I co-founded Reimagine Co, a package-free grocery store and community hub, and later launched the Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS), a not-for-profit organization focused on circular economy initiatives, including a Thing Library, Repair Café, and free community workshops. Through ICS, we are looking to prototype web3-enabled finance and governance, exploring how DAOs, impact attestations, and decentralized funding mechanisms can support local sustainability efforts.

Since entering the web3 space in 2021, I have contributed to multiple projects focused on governance, funding, and public goods. I am a core contributor to SuperBenefit and All In For Sport, and am shaping the Reimagining Power Project (RPP), which explores how web3 can redistribute power, mobilize capital, and transform systems toward more equitable outcomes.

The RPP is an experiment in decentralized governance and regenerative finance, designed to shift power from centralized entities to communities. Through this project, we are:

- Developing and testing decentralized decision-making models, including DAO-based governance frameworks.

- Creating open-source playbooks, documenting effective web3-enabled approaches to participatory governance, funding, and community-driven impact

- Hosting a series of online gatherings, where policymakers, activists, funders, and builders come together as a community of practice to explore the potential of web3 technologies to enable community-led resource allocation​

- Conducting small-scale real-world experiments to validate how blockchain can enhance transparency, accountability, efficiency and equity in social impact funding​

Through this work, I am deeply engaged in public goods funding experiments, helping to design and implement participatory economic models that incentivize and sustain impact-driven projects. These experiments focus on bridging grassroots activism with digital coordination tools, ensuring that communities have the autonomy and resources they need to thrive

Beyond my professional work, I am a father, stepfather, spoken word poet, and facilitator, passionate about poetic harvesting, creative storytelling, and placemaking. I have a background in public service in the UK, international development work in Guatemala, community organizing in India, and social entrepreneurship in Canada, all of which inform my intersectional approach to community building and regenerative finance.

Now, I am excited to greenpill London, Ontario, to merge web3 tech with local grassroots activism, empowering communities to co-create regenerative, decentralized economic models.

## 2 Why do you want to start a Chapter? What are your goals and what initiatives are you planning to explore as a Chapter?\*

I want to start a Green Pill London chapter to establish a local node in the decentralized regenerative web3 ecosystem, integrating blockchain-enabled funding and governance mechanisms into grassroots sustainability efforts. London is home to a thriving community of environmental advocates, circular economy initiatives, and community-driven projects, yet many of these efforts struggle with funding, governance, and scalability. Green Pill London will bridge local regenerative projects with global coordination tools to address these challenges and amplify impact.

Goals for the Chapter:

1. Prototype web3-enabled governance and funding models for community-led sustainability initiatives.

2. Cultivate a regenerative local economy by integrating web3-based coordination tools like impact attestations, quadratic funding, and DAOs into local repair, reuse, and sharing initiatives.

3. Strengthen community ownership and agency by implementing decentralized decision-making processes that distribute power and resources equitably.

4. Build bridges between web3 and grassroots activism, onboarding community members to accessible, practical uses of blockchain for social impact.

### Key Initiatives to Explore:

#### 1. Community-Led Quadratic Funding (QF) Rounds

We will pilot a local QF experiment to distribute funding to community projects, artists, and/or sustainability initiatives. Participants will propose projects, and the community will decide where funds are allocated through quadratic funding or quadratic voting, ensuring that funding reflects broad community support rather than the interests of a few large donors.

#### 2. Impact Attestations & Hypercerts

We will develop and test blockchain-based attestations to verify and reward contributions to public goods, such as repair cafés, mutual aid efforts, and community-led sustainability projects. These on-chain attestations will enable transparent tracking of impact, unlocking new funding opportunities through retroactive public goods funding (RPGF) models.

#### 3. Decentralized Governance Experiments

The chapter will test participatory governance models based on mycelial, fractal, and holonic structures, allowing local projects to operate autonomously while remaining interconnected. We will explore:

- A stakeholder governance model where community members and project stewards participate in decision-making.

- DAO tools for collective resource allocation using governance primitives such as Gnosis Safe, Hats Protocol, and Coordinape.

- Community-run treasury experiments to distribute resources transparently and equitably.

#### 4. Web3 Onboarding & Regenerative Coordination

To onboard non-technical community members into regenerative web3 practices, we will:

- Host hands-on workshops to demystify cryptocurrencies, DAOs, NFTs, quadratic funding, and impact attestations.

- Offer user-friendly web3 tools (e.g., wallet abstraction, social logins, reputation-based coordination) to remove friction.

- Create regenerative media (blogs, articles, podcasts, etc) to document lessons learned and share them globally.

Green Pill London will serve as a hub for experimentation and knowledge-sharing, connecting local actors to global regenerative finance movements like Green Pill Network, ReFi DAO, Celo Public Goods, and Regens Unite. By aligning grassroots community organizing with decentralized economic systems, we can prototype scalable models of local resilience and mutual aid.

### **3. Who will you be starting this Chapter with? How do you plan on building a local community?**

Having Co-Steward(s) and/or others who are interested in taking this journey with you is incredibly helpful. Do you have any experience or plans with community building?

A key collaborator in launching Green Pill London is Corduroy Earth and Lliam Buckley, a local regenerative leader with whom we have already collaborated. Additionally, three other key contributors to SuperBenefit DAO live in London, providing a strong local base of web3 practitioners who are already engaged in decentralized governance and impact-focused initiatives. As co-founder and president of the Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS), a founding board member of the London Environmental Network, and a contributor to local solidarity initiatives, I bring deep connections to London’s sustainability and grassroots organizing community, including partnerships with environmental networks, mutual aid groups, and local regenerative projects.

### Community Building Experience

I have been building communities for over two decades, starting with student activism and involvement in the anti-war movement in the early 2000s. My career as a labour organizer in England deepened my understanding of grassroots mobilization, governance structures, and collective action.

Since moving to Canada, I have:

- Founded City of Neighbours Day, a celebration of grassroots placemaking and local activism.

- Co-organized the Place Matters Conference, a gathering focused on regenerative cities, mutual aid, and participatory governance.

- Served on a neighbourhood association, working to decentralize power and increase community participation.

- Organized mutual aid efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic, coordinating resource-sharing and direct support networks to strengthen local resilience.

- Co-founded Earthfest, now an annual festival bringing together environmental organizations, artists, educators and the wider community

- Nurtured community through hosting repair cafés, starting a thing library, operating a community hub and event space, and presenting over 130 free workshops.

### **Future Plans**

Green Pill London will build upon this legacy by developing a decentralized, participatory model that connects regenerative finance principles with local action. We plan to:

- Prototype a governance model that decentralizes decision-making and redistributes power.

- Run community-driven funding experiments, such as quadratic funding rounds and DAO-based participatory budgeting.

- Onboard community members to blockchain tools, providing accessible, jargon-free educational resources to integrate impact attestations and public goods funding into real-world projects.

- Advocate for regenerative policies, engaging local, provincial, and federal decision-makers to embed web3 coordination mechanisms into sustainability governance.

By leveraging web3 for public goods and circular economy initiatives, we will catalyze systemic change while ensuring broad-based community ownership and participation.

### **Community-Building Strategy**

Green Pill London will be structured as a participatory community, welcoming activists, policymakers, technologists, and builders to collaboratively shape its direction. Our multi-pronged strategy includes:

- Regular (monthly) in-person events to foster engagement, create touchpoints for collaboration, and onboard new members.

- Free web3 onboarding workshops, ensuring that non-technical community members can participate in DAO governance, impact attestations, and quadratic funding.

- Advocacy efforts targeting elected officials at all levels and city bureaucrats, ensuring that regenerative finance principles influence local decision-making.

- A PR/media campaign to amplify our work, attract new participants, and position London as a leader in regenerative economic experimentation.

By integrating web3 tools into grassroots sustainability efforts, we will create a resilient, community-owned ecosystem that is funded, governed, and driven by local stakeholders.

### **5. How can the Greenpill community support your regenerative efforts?**

The Green Pill Network can support Green Pill London by providing:

- Guidance on onboarding materials and practices, including slide decks, scripts, and structured frameworks for introducing web3 concepts to grassroots activists and policymakers.

- Best practices from other local chapters, particularly in governance, community engagement, quadratic funding logistics, and impact attestations.

- Technical and strategic mentorship, helping to refine London’s web3 integration roadmap and maximize impact.

- Support with vibes and belonging, recognizing that this journey can often feel lonely and like an uphill struggle. Having a strong peer network to share challenges, successes, and motivation will be essential for sustaining momentum.

- Connections to global funders and grant programs within the regen ecosystem and in the wider web3 landscape, helping to secure resources for local experiments and long-term sustainability.

With this support, Green Pill London can anchor web3 in real-world regenerative action, demonstrating the power of decentralized systems to foster local resilience, equity, and sustainability.
