# Migration Needs

- SuperBenefit's _web3 library_ is stored on Notion and needs to be consolidated in CharmVerse. The current library webpage is [here](https://superbenefit.notion.site/web3-Library-7819e3c7a9fb482998cad3822e5dcb82) and the Notion database is [here](https://www.notion.so/superbenefit/web3-Library-bac3bc1e548b49808b9a99723f79b404). There are 171 resources in the library in total. Link to new library database:  

- Since much of this information is incomplete and/or out of date, during the migration process we will update and curate the content: removing articles that are no longer current or useful, adding metadata, adding summaries, etc.

- This is an opportunity to focus the library's resources more around aspects of web3 that of particular interest to SB and the RPP
