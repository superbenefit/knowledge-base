# Evaluation and Next Steps Report

## All In For Sport Knowledge Mobilization Partnership

April 2025

## Executive Summary

The All In For Sport (AIFS) Knowledge Mobilization Partnership, supported by the Ontario Trillium Foundation (OTF), successfully delivered a series of interactive learning sessions exploring the intersection of Web3 technologies, community governance, and grassroots sports initiatives. This report evaluates the outcomes of the partnership against its initial goals, documents key learnings, and outlines strategic next steps for continuing this important work.

Over the course of four months (November 2024 to February 2025), the partnership engaged participants from 38 organizations through six salon-style gatherings, exceeding the initial target of five sessions. The series created a vibrant community of practice bringing together sports administrators, community organizers, technologists, and funders to explore innovative approaches to decentralized, community-led sports development.

This report documents both the tangible outputs of the partnership and the intangible outcomes that have emerged through this collaborative learning journey. It concludes with concrete recommendations for building on the momentum generated and scaling the impact of this work.

## Program Evaluation

### Goals and Objectives Assessment

The Knowledge Mobilization Partnership set out to achieve the following primary objectives:

1. **Knowledge Transfer**: Increase understanding of Web3 technologies and decentralized governance models among sports organizations

2. **Community Building**: Create a supportive network of practitioners exploring similar questions

3. **Resource Development**: Co-create practical resources to support implementation

4. **Partnership Development**: Facilitate new collaborations between technology providers and sports initiatives

Our evaluation indicates strong achievement across all four objectives, with particularly notable success in community building and partnership development. The program's participatory approach enabled us to adapt to community needs throughout the process, resulting in high engagement and tangible outcomes.

### Success Indicators

Several indicators point to the program's success:

1. **Sustained Engagement**: High retention rates across the series with growing participation in inter-session activities on Discord and LinkedIn

2. **Implementation Initiatives**: Multiple participants have begun implementing concepts explored in the gatherings

3. **Resource Utilization**: Strong engagement with program resources through the video archive

4. **New Collaborations**: Two funded projects emerged directly from connections made during the gatherings

5. **Program Extension**: Invitation to continue the work through the IOC's Tech365 Explorer program

### Challenges and Adaptations

The program encountered several challenges that required adaptive responses:

1. **Knowledge Disparities**: Wide variance in participants' familiarity with Web3 concepts required us to restructure early sessions to build foundational understanding

2. **Technical Barriers**: Some participants faced challenges with Discord and Web3 wallet setup, prompting the creation of dedicated onboarding resources

3. **Implementation Gap**: Translating theoretical concepts to practical applications required more concrete examples and case studies than initially anticipated

4. **Geographic Barriers**: Time zone differences limited synchronous participation for some regions, leading to enhanced asynchronous engagement options

These challenges informed our approach throughout the program and have shaped our recommendations for future work.

## Key Learnings

### Insights About the Sector

1. **Technology Readiness**: The sports sector demonstrates significant interest in decentralized technologies but varies widely in readiness for implementation. Organizations benefit from graduated entry points and clear use cases aligned with existing priorities.

2. **Equity Considerations**: Without intentional design, Web3 technologies risk reproducing existing power imbalances in sports development. Participatory approaches are essential from the earliest design phases.

3. **Shared Language**: Building a common vocabulary across technologists and sports for development practitioners is a crucial first step. Participants valued concrete examples that translated technical concepts into practical applications.

4. **Implementation Pathways**: Organizations need support at multiple stages of implementation - from conceptual exploration to technical execution. The most successful adopters started with small pilots that addressed specific community needs.

5. **Capital Coordination**: Innovative funding mechanisms represent one of the most immediately valuable applications of Web3 for sports initiatives, particularly for under-resourced communities and projects.

### Content and Programming Insights

1. **Session Structure**: The salon format successfully balanced structured learning with emergence. Each gathering included expert input, peer exchange, and collaborative synthesis.

2. **Documentation Methods**: Creative documentation approaches, particularly poetic harvesting, resonated deeply with participants and created shareable artifacts that extended the impact beyond direct participants.

3. **Learning Progression**: The most effective learning journey moved from conceptual understanding to concrete applications to implementation planning. Participants valued both inspirational vision and practical next steps.

4. **Community Governance**: Practicing participatory governance within the program itself (Session 0 for co-design, ongoing feedback loops) strengthened both participant engagement and the relevance of content.

5. **Multi-Platform Engagement**: Different stakeholder groups preferred different engagement platforms (Web3 natives in Discord, sports and development professionals on LinkedIn), suggesting that meeting participants where they are is more effective than forcing adoption of new platforms.

## Impact Stories

### Community Basketball Initiative

A community organizer managing basketball courts in underserved neighbourhoods joined the gatherings seeking sustainable funding models. Through connections made during the series, they participated in a quadratic funding round with Giveth, through which their initiative ([Every Court Can Dream](https://giveth.io/project/every-court-can-dream)) has since received grant funding and is working in several communities.

### Indigenous Sports Knowledge Preservation

Representatives from an indigenous community-based organization connected with digital archivists during the gatherings to explore how Web3 technologies could protect and share traditional sports practices while maintaining community ownership and governance. Their collaboration ([Huottoja University of Ancestral Knowledge](https://giveth.io/project/huottoja-university-of-ancestral-knowledge)) is now developing a blockchain-based system that records ancestral games and movement practices using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that preserve community ownership.

### Regional Sports Association Governance Reform

A global sports for development association began exploring how to make their community governance systems more inclusive and responsive to community needs. Inspired by the decentralized governance models presented in the gatherings, they are exploring using digital tooling to increase transparency and participant voice in decision-making. This work continues beyond the formal conclusion of the knowledge mobilization partnership.

## Next Steps and Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 3-6 Months)

1. **Community Maintenance**: Continue supporting the Discord and LinkedIn communities as spaces for ongoing exchange, with lightweight facilitation to sustain momentum.

2. **Implementation Support**: Provide targeted follow-up support to organizations actively implementing concepts from the gatherings, potentially through peer mentorship connections.

3. **Documentation Sharing**: Make session recordings, poetic harvests, and collaborative notes available through a public-facing platform to extend impact beyond direct participants.

### Medium-Term Opportunities (6-18 Months)

1. **Learning Cohorts**: Develop structured cohort-based learning journeys for organizations at similar implementation stages to provide more intensive support than the salon format allows.

2. **Regional Adaptations**: Partner with regional sports networks to adapt and contextualize learnings for specific geographic and cultural contexts.

3. **Technical Assistance Program**: Establish a technical assistance program connecting Web3 developers with sports initiatives seeking implementation support.
