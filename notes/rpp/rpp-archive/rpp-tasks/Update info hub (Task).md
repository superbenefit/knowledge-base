## Overview

The Information hub contains all public-facing documentation, and currently serves as the SuperBenefit homepage. It contains information such as:

- Official Links

- Org description / intro

- Descriptions of projects

- Links to Articles

- Event Listings/Recordings

- SB's ToC, Purpose & Mission statements

- Links to getting started articles & web3 library

- Governance info & NFT links

The info hub is currently hosted at [https://superbenefit.org](https://superbenefit.org), and must be migrated to Charmverse in order to consolidate our knowledge resources. 

# Migration & Edits Needed

All content on Notion should be migrated to Charmverse. Once content is migrated and updated, the  will be published at community.superbenefit.org.

Some content may be missing or out of date, so migrated content should be reviewed and edited for correctness. Pages should then be curated to add new information as needed and/or relocate anything which would be better included elsewhere.

## To-Do's:

- Check already-migrated content for errors and omissions; Edit as needed

- Move unnecessary content to sub-pages as needed.

- Format page and add any additional content needed using the charmverse editor

### After Review:

- Update DNS & activate Charmverse custom domain

- Publish links to community.superbenefit.org

# Progress Tracking

This task's progress will be tracked using this document, and by checking the status of the  pages.

### Outcomes

-  

  - The Info Hub will be considered complete when it (and its sub-pages) are reasonably equivalent to the [SuperBenefit Home Page](https://superbenefit.org/).

### Review

A workstream steward should review the Info Hub upon completion, updating any errors and adding context where needed. The steward should then perform and/or request the to-do's mentioned in the "after review" section above.
