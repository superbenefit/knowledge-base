# OS Stewards: Week 12 Progress Update

## Introduction

The Reimagining Power Project (RPP) is a collaborative initiative aimed at exploring the potential of Web3 technologies and decentralized governance models to transform the social impact sector. Over the course of the past 12 weeks, the team has made significant progress in establishing operational structures, conducting experiments, and developing key deliverables.

## Operational Developments

The Operations and Strategy Stewards (OS Stewards) are a subset of the project's Core Team, established in August 2024 to streamline decision-making and improve coordination. The team defined roles, responsibilities, and accountability mechanisms, and agreed on a one-month trial period to assess the effectiveness of the new structure.

Throughout the project, the Core Team has focused on clarifying the strategic focus, aligning workstreams, and generating momentum. The previous  workstreams - Onboarding, Social Impact, Knowledge Stewardship and DAO Primitives - have been integrated into other initiatives and refined to better support the project's goals.

The team has also engaged in discussions with external partners, including Ontario Trillium Foundation (OTF), to secure additional funding and align the project with broader initiatives in the field.

## Experiments

The RPP is conducting three main experiments focused on exploring decentralized governance models and Web3 tools in different contexts:

1. **All in for Sport (AIFS):** The team collaborated with AIFS to develop a network governance structure and craft a narrative around community gatherings. Funding was secured through Canadian Tire Jumpstart and OTF, and the team began planning a series of 6 gatherings from November to March.

2. **Equality Fund:** A scoping session was completed to explore Web3 tools for addressing pain points in fund distribution, transaction approvals, and foreign exchange. The team is preparing a Discovery Report and continued working with the Equality Fund to identify ideas for experimentation.

3. **Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS):** Initial stakeholder mapping and sense-making began, focusing on developing a DAO-like structure to guide future initiatives. The team explored resources for local node experiments and identified this as a potentially impactful direction for federations of local nodes coordinating across communities.

## Deliverables

The RPP is working on three main deliverables:

1. **Gatherings:** In collaboration with AIFS, the team planned a series of community gatherings to weave together network members. Funding was secured, and the team discussed decentralizing authority by creating a "Gathering Steward" role within the Community Experience cell.

2. **Playbooks:** The team advanced the Playbook Project operational plan, receiving a report from MoreReese and working on defining 'what constitutes a playbook.' Collaboration with OpenCivics was established, and research tasks were created to engage contributors in playbook design. The team also discussed the need for a retrospective and sense-making session to align on the project's direction.

3. **Other Media:** The team explored partnerships for podcast episodes and media, and identified the need to write an RFP for media to inform and reward creators.

## Conclusion

Over the past 12 weeks, the Reimagining Power Project has made significant strides in establishing operational structures, conducting experiments, and developing key deliverables. The team navigated challenges, refined their approach, and leveraged partnerships to advance their goals. As the project moves forward, the team is well-positioned to continue exploring the potential of Web3 and decentralized governance models to transform the social impact sector.

# Project Evaluation

The Reimagining Power Project has made significant progress in establishing operational structures, conducting experiments, and developing deliverables. However, given the complexity of the project and the ambitious goals, there are concerns about the likelihood of completing the project on time.

### What's Working

1. Collaborative approach and partnerships with organizations like AIFS, Equality Fund, and ICS

2. Securing funding from external sources like OTF and Canadian Tire

3. Establishment of the O&S Stewards team to improve coordination and decision-making

4. Refinement of workstreams to better align with project goals

5. Progress on key deliverables such as Gatherings, Playbooks, and Social Impact paper

### What's Not Working

1. Some workstreams, like Knowledge Stewardship and DAO Primitives, have been phased out or lack clear direction

2. Coordination challenges, it is still time consuming and logistically difficult to coordinate with external partners

3. Delays in finalizing documents and decisions

### Potential Risks

1. Complexity of the project and ambitious goals may lead to delays or incomplete deliverables

2. Dependence on external partnerships and funding could create bottlenecks or misalignments

3. Difficulty in maintaining engagement and momentum across a diverse range of stakeholders and contributors

4. Technical challenges in implementing Web3 and decentralized governance solutions

## OS Stewards Evaluation

The OS Stewards team has been instrumental in driving the project forward, establishing operational structures, and facilitating decision-making. However, the team has faced challenges in maintaining clarity, alignment, and momentum across all workstreams. Improving communication, setting clear priorities, and defining success metrics could help the team better navigate the complexity of the project.

### Individual Evaluations

1. **Heenal:** Heenal has been instrumental in driving the Gatherings workstream, securing funding, and coordinating with AIFS. He has also contributed to the development of onboarding processes and the Social Impact paper. Heenal could improve by more proactively identifying and addressing potential roadblocks and dependencies in his workstreams.

2. **Rowan:** Rowan has been a consistent contributor, particularly in the development of the Partnership Governance Model, Equality Fund experiment and the OTF briefing. He has also been active in driving strategic discussions and providing thoughtful feedback. Rowan could improve by more clearly communicating his capacity and bandwidth to ensure he is not overextended.

3. **Michelle:** Michelle has provided valuable strategic guidance and has been instrumental in aligning the project with broader initiatives in the field. However, Michelle's involvement has been somewhat inconsistent.

4. **Filsan:** Filsan played a key role in the development of the Social Impact paper and contributed to the coordination of various workstreams. She also provided valuable insights during strategic discussions and helped to maintain alignment with the project's goals.  

5. **Rather:** Rather has been a key contributor, particularly in the ICS experiment discovery and the development of the Playbooks project. They have also been active in coordinating with external partners and driving strategic discussions. However, Rather could benefit from more clearly communicating priorities and delegating tasks to ensure a more balanced workload.

In conclusion, while the Reimagining Power Project has made significant progress, there are concerns about the likelihood of completing the project on time given its complexity and the challenges faced by the OS Stewards team. Focusing on improving communication, setting clear priorities, and defining success metrics could help the team navigate these challenges and increase the chances of delivering on the project's ambitious goals. Additionally, onboarding new contributors and ensuring a smooth transition of responsibilities will be crucial for maintaining the project's momentum.

# Status as of week 12:

## **Admin Workstreams**

### General Coordination:

- Clarity around workstream tasks has improved, and there is now a stronger sense of coordination milestones emerging across different teams. New conversations have been initiated with OTF for additional fundingâ€‹ .

- Some workstreams have stopped work for Phase 1, and are figuring out how work will be managed in the future.

### Onboarding:

- Status: [Onboarding Workstream Page](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/reimagining-power-onboarding-draft-01741435812079062) and [orientation guide](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/reimagining-power-orientation-guide-draft-7277798369973094) are live and we have begun onboarding new contributors using this flow.

- Meetings: Onboarding has been integrated into CX meetings, which are now taking place on Discord every Wednesday from 12 to 1 EST. 

- Next Steps:

  - Complete Onboarding Documentation

  - Onboard Colleen, Julia and Jose (in progress)

### Social Impact:

- Paper Progress: [Two pager completed](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1182283093630009444/1291514648889131119/Reimagining_Power__How_Web3_Can_Reimagine_Power_in_Social_Impact_3.pdf?ex=6704fd7f&is=6703abff&hm=e446aaa6a349ff11cf332a8be940b4c8e3d053d797b80a2399de86d779488920&) and reviewed.

- Direction Change: The direction of the paper has shifted to better align with core team strategy.

- Partner Convening: Ongoing, with an emphasis on integrating insights into future strategies.

- Next Steps:

  - Agree upon a cover image for the post and then publish the post

### Knowledge Stewardship:

- Phase 1: Complete, with some bounties still needing fulfillment.

- Phase 2:  Planning phases are probably phasing out. Need to re-plan workstream tasks and coordinate w/ onboarding for contributions

- Databases: Created for various types of information generated by RPP, including topics/terms, artifacts, and links. 

- Task Handling: No current process for managing tasks and bounties.

- Workstream Status: The Knowledge Stewardship workstream is no longer needed within RPP; contributors can use the KS admin workstream in Charmverse to track related work.

### Primitives:

- Initial Framing: Complete, but formatting for readability is needed based on core team feedback.

- Next Steps: Work on the parts of the DAO primitives that we need to interface with the facilitation process. To integrate DAO primitives models with issues/power dynamics identified in experiment facilitation framework and apply these insights to the experiments scoping/implementation. This will include making pattern libraries useful and how to facilitate working through these in the design phase. 

- Workstream Status: No need to continue the DAO Primitives Workstream beyond its current state.

## **Experiments**

### AIFS:

- Focus: Exploring a network governance structure for AIFS. We'll be helping to craft a narrative around Gatherings and building opportunities for sharing and co-ownership.

- Status: The AIFS gatherings have now received funding through Canadian Tire and OTF. A decentralized authority structure has been developed for managing these gatherings and a cadence of weekly meetings established. All AIFS project contacts have been sent a pitch deck and "save the date" message for all the gatherings.

- Timeline: A series of 6 Gatherings to run from November to March. Dates set.

- Participants: AIFS, SB, OTF, JumpStart, Women Win, Ready Sport, Calgary Parks, potentially Krause House. Calgary Parks are being looped into the gatherings and see where this guides us. We will use this as an opportunity to evolve the AIFS governance in general as it changes its shape

- Next Steps:

  - Send out Luma invites

  - Create POAPs

  - Promote the gatherings through our networks and on social media

### Equality Fund:

- "A scoping session for the Equality Fund experiment has been completed, focusing on exploring Web3 tools to address specific pain points like fund distribution, transaction approvals, and foreign exchange. The team are preparing a Discovery Report and will continue working with Sue to zero in on ideas for experimentation."

- Timeline: Fall/Winter, potentially identified. 

- Information: Sue has shared details on their allocation system. She has an idea for an experiment doing participatory grantmaking in parallel.

 

### Institute for Community Sustainability:

- "Initial stakeholder mapping and sense-making around the Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) have begun. Discussions are focused on developing a DAO-like structure to guide future initiatives."

- Parallel Work: Developing resources for local node experiments to support, potentially through the playbooks project, which could provide guidelines for establishing DAO-style local nodes. 

- Direction: This could be an impactful direction, particularly in federations of local nodes coordinating across communities.

## **Deliverables**

### Gatherings:

- Objective: Weave together network members as part of a community initiative.

- Partnership: Collaboration with AIFS, involving key participants such as Shanny, Nicole, Heenal, and Filsan. 

- Funding for the AIFS gatherings has been confirmed with $20,000 CAD from Canadian Tire and OTF. A 'Gatherings Steward' role has been created to decentralize authority over event management, and the CX Stewards have collectively taken on this role.

- Next Steps:

  - Most gatherings work is not RPP-related. We should map stakeholders and get resources to the relevant contributors

  - Funding just confirmed through Canadian Tire and OTF ($20k CAD total)

  - If we can support where we can, pushing some funding where needed

  - AIFS is taking the lead and there is little for us needing to do

  - The responsibility can be pushed to AIFS (probably Shanny) 

### Playbooks:

- "The Playbook Project operational plan is advancing, and the team has received a report from MoreReese. A clear definition of 'what constitutes a playbook' is being developed to ensure consistency and alignment across future tasks."  

- Status: Visioning and planning session completed on Sep 9. MoreReese is developing a report, which includes project plan, project charter, stakeholder registry & risk registry, and recommendations/next steps

- Collaboration: Networking with other playbook creators at OpenCivics to collaborate on outputs. 

- Expected Outputs: A meta playbook (DAOs and Philanthropy playbook) and other playbooks created in collaboration with OpenCivics.

- 10k was raised for the OS patterns project which will fold into the playbooks project

- Super task for Playbooks is here  

- Research tasks are being created to engage contributors in Playbook design

### Other Media:

- Opportunities: Exploring partnerships for podcast episodes and media.
