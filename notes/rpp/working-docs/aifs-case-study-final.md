# Reimagining Power at All In For Sport

*From NFT Project to Coordi-nation: How a DAO Discovered Its Purpose Through Patient Experimentation*

**A SuperBenefit Case Study in Decentralized Governance Transformation**

---

## Executive Summary

All In For Sport's transformation from a struggling NFT project to a thriving coordination platform demonstrates the power of organizational evolution guided by genuine stakeholder needs. What began as an attempt to revolutionize grassroots sports funding through blockchain technology became something far more valuable: a "coordi-nation" that bridges the seemingly insurmountable gap between Web3 innovation and community sports development.

The organization faced three interconnected challenges that threatened its viability. An unclear value proposition made it nearly impossible to communicate with funders or attract partners. Complete reliance on volunteer effort created an unsustainable operational model that limited reliability and growth. Perhaps most critically, the vast knowledge gap between Web3 developers and grassroots sports organizations prevented meaningful collaboration despite shared goals of empowering marginalized communities.

Through the Reimagining Power Project experiment, All In For Sport implemented a two-pronged intervention that addressed these systemic issues. The Gatherings series created structured yet emergent spaces where diverse stakeholders could build relationships and co-create knowledge, revealing unexpected enthusiasm from the Web3 community for social impact applications. Simultaneously, a governance transformation formalized the organization's evolution into a coordi-nation model, establishing autonomous operational cells within a networked structure that maintains mission alignment while enabling agile execution.

The results exceeded expectations in some areas while revealing persistent challenges in others. All In For Sport successfully clarified its identity as a coordination layer and developed replicable models for cross-sector collaboration. The governance transformation created structures that would prove their worth in subsequent months, enabling successful collaborations beyond the experiment period. However, the fundamental challenge of sustainable funding for coordination work remains unresolved, highlighting a systemic gap in how both traditional philanthropy and Web3 ecosystems value infrastructure over direct service delivery.

This case study offers critical insights for organizations navigating the intersection of technological innovation and social impact. The experiment demonstrates that coordination creates more value than direct service delivery in nascent ecosystems, that patient relationship-building is prerequisite for meaningful cross-sector collaboration, and that organizational clarity emerges through action and reflection rather than strategic planning alone. For those seeking to bridge disparate communities around shared purpose, All In For Sport's journey provides both inspiration and practical guidance for the patient work of transformation.

## Background and Context

### The Organization

All In For Sport emerged from the optimistic early days of Web3 social impact experimentation, when blockchain enthusiasts believed technology alone could solve entrenched social problems. Founded as a decentralized autonomous organization modeled after the successful NounsDAO framework, AIFS aimed to revolutionize how grassroots sports initiatives received funding. The vision was compelling in its simplicity: create NFTs that supporters could purchase, with proceeds flowing directly to community sports programs serving marginalized populations.

The organization attracted a diverse group of initial contributors drawn to the intersection of cutting-edge technology and social purpose. These pioneers included web3 facilitators excited about real-world applications, sports program managers seeking innovative funding solutions, and social entrepreneurs exploring new models for community empowerment. Despite this promising start, the organization soon discovered that bridging these different worlds required more than good intentions and smart contracts.

What makes All In For Sport's story particularly noteworthy is its willingness to fundamentally reimagine its purpose when initial assumptions proved flawed. Rather than doubling down on a failing model or quietly disbanding like many early DAOs, the organization chose the more difficult path of honest self-examination and radical transformation. This resilience, combined with the organization's position at a critical intersection of technology and social impact, makes their journey relevant to anyone seeking to understand how decentralized coordination can serve community needs.

### The Challenge

The systemic issues facing All In For Sport reflected broader challenges in both the Web3 ecosystem and traditional nonprofit sector. The organization's struggle to articulate its value proposition went beyond marketing difficulties. When meeting with potential funders, team members found themselves caught between two incompatible narratives. For traditional philanthropists, the Web3 elements seemed like unnecessary complexity obscuring straightforward charitable work. For crypto-native funders, the shift away from NFTs toward coordination felt like abandoning innovation for process.

This identity crisis manifested in practical operational challenges. Without clear understanding of what All In For Sport offered, potential partners remained hesitant to engage. Website visitors left confused rather than inspired. Social media posts oscillated between technical jargon and community impact stories without finding coherent voice. The organization risked becoming everything to everyone while serving no one effectively.

The sustainability challenge proved equally daunting. Operating entirely on volunteer effort meant that organizational capacity fluctuated wildly based on contributors' other commitments. Promises made to community partners sometimes went unfulfilled not from lack of intention but lack of available human resources. The original vision included sophisticated systems for recognizing and rewarding contributions, but these required scale and resources the organization had not achieved. This created a vicious cycle where lack of resources prevented activities that might generate resources.

Perhaps most fundamentally, All In For Sport struggled to bridge the vast knowledge and cultural gap between Web3 innovators and grassroots sports organizations. Technical discussions about smart contracts and tokenomics excluded community partners who brought deep wisdom about local needs. Conversely, conversations about community development and sports program management seemed mundane to developers seeking to push technological boundaries. Previous attempts to address these issues through traditional strategic planning had failed, suggesting that deeper transformation was required.

### The Journey Begins

The catalyst for change came through All In For Sport's inclusion in the Reimagining Power Project, an initiative exploring how Web3 technologies could genuinely redistribute power rather than merely digitizing existing hierarchies. This opportunity arrived at a moment when the organization had exhausted conventional approaches to resolving its challenges. The combination of external support and internal readiness created conditions for authentic transformation.

Initial conversations within the RPP framework revealed that All In For Sport was not alone in facing these challenges. Other organizations attempting to bridge Web3 innovation with social impact encountered similar struggles around identity, sustainability, and cross-sector communication. This recognition shifted the narrative from organizational failure to systemic challenge, opening space for more creative responses.

Key champions emerged from unexpected places. Shannon Lanigan, whose background spanned both grassroots organizing and DAO governance, became a bridge figure capable of translating between different stakeholder groups. The SuperBenefit team provided frameworks and facilitation that gave structure to what might otherwise have been chaotic experimentation. Perhaps most importantly, the broader community of contributors demonstrated remarkable patience and commitment through uncertainty, trusting that clarity would emerge through action rather than planning.

The resources available, while modest, proved sufficient for experimentation. The RPP support provided governance transformation expertise and documentation infrastructure. Separately secured funding from Jumpstart and the Ontario Trillium Foundation enabled the Gatherings series. Most critically, the organization possessed significant relational capital - trust and connections across both Web3 and sports communities that money alone could not purchase. These relationships would prove to be the foundation upon which everything else was built.

## Approach

### From Discovery to Strategy

The Discovery phase revealed insights that fundamentally shaped All In For Sport's intervention strategy. Rather than viewing their challenges as separate problems requiring distinct solutions, the organization recognized them as interconnected symptoms of a deeper misalignment. The unclear value proposition stemmed not from poor communication but from attempting to be something the ecosystem didn't need. The sustainability crisis reflected not just resource scarcity but misunderstanding about what kind of organization AIFS was becoming. The knowledge gaps between communities highlighted not deficiencies in either group but the absence of appropriate bridging infrastructure.

This systemic understanding led to an intervention approach that addressed root causes rather than symptoms. Instead of crafting better marketing messages, the strategy focused on demonstrating value through action. Rather than seeking traditional funding for predetermined programs, the approach created conditions for sustainable models to emerge. Most importantly, rather than trying to educate each community about the other's domain, the intervention designed spaces where mutual learning could occur naturally.

Stakeholder involvement in strategy development proved essential to its ultimate success. Through extensive consultation, patterns emerged about what different groups actually needed. Blockchain developers attending gatherings sought meaningful applications for their skills beyond financial speculation. Grassroots organizations wanted agency in designing their own solutions rather than receiving prescribed technologies. Funders expressed interest in supporting innovation but needed clearer understanding of impact. These insights shaped an approach that served multiple constituencies without compromising depth for breadth.

The strategic choice to pursue both Gatherings and governance transformation simultaneously reflected understanding that cultural and structural change must proceed together. Creating new relationships without organizational infrastructure to support them would waste social capital. Conversely, implementing governance changes without constituent buy-in would create empty structures. The parallel approach allowed each intervention to reinforce the other.

### Patterns and Interventions

The selection of specific patterns for implementation emerged from careful analysis of what the ecosystem needed and what All In For Sport was uniquely positioned to provide. The Gatherings pattern, drawn from community organizing traditions and adapted for digital-physical hybrid contexts, offered a proven approach for bringing diverse stakeholders into generative dialogue. Unlike conferences that privilege speakers over participants or workshops that assume predetermined learning objectives, Gatherings create conditions for emergence while maintaining enough structure to be productive.

The coordi-nations pattern represented a more fundamental reimagining of organizational structure. Rather than viewing All In For Sport as a single entity trying to be all things to all people, this pattern reconceptualized it as a network of aligned communities each maintaining autonomy while sharing resources and purpose. This addressed the core tension between needing coherent identity and serving diverse constituencies. The pattern drew inspiration from successful network organizations while adapting principles for the Web3 context.

Supporting patterns included cell structure for operational autonomy and resource-sharing mechanisms for sustainability. The cell structure pattern enabled small teams to pursue specific projects without bureaucratic overhead while maintaining accountability to shared values. Resource-sharing mechanisms created potential for financial sustainability by allowing successful cells to contribute to common infrastructure while benefiting from network effects.

The rationale for these selections went beyond theoretical fit. Each pattern had demonstrated success in analogous contexts. Gatherings had proven effective in other cross-sector collaboration efforts. Network organizations showed resilience and adaptability across various domains. Cell structures enabled both autonomy and alignment in complex organizations. The combination created a comprehensive approach addressing All In For Sport's interconnected challenges.

### Resource Mobilization

Implementing the intervention required assembling diverse resources beyond simple financial capital. Human resources represented the most critical element, with skilled facilitation essential for managing conversations between groups with different knowledge bases, communication styles, and expectations. The organization leveraged existing relationships to identify facilitators who understood both Web3 and community development contexts, a rare combination that proved invaluable.

Technical infrastructure requirements remained deliberately minimal, challenging assumptions about Web3 initiatives needing complex platforms. Basic video conferencing, collaborative documents, and simple project management tools sufficed for most activities. The DAO's existing governance infrastructure on Optimism blockchain provided necessary decision-making frameworks without requiring participants to navigate unfamiliar interfaces. This simplicity reduced barriers to participation while demonstrating that coordination value came from human connections rather than technological sophistication.

Financial resources came from multiple sources, reflecting the intervention's hybrid nature. Jumpstart and the Ontario Trillium Foundation specifically supported the Gatherings series, recognizing its potential for ecosystem development. The Reimagining Power Project provided resources for governance transformation and documentation. Critically, both funding approaches understood and supported experimentation, providing patient capital that allowed for emergence rather than demanding predetermined outcomes. This alignment between funder expectations and intervention philosophy proved essential for authentic transformation.

Knowledge resources often overlooked in traditional planning proved equally vital. The SuperBenefit DAO Primitives Framework provided tested governance models adaptable to All In For Sport's specific context. Documentation from other organizations' transformation journeys offered both inspiration and practical guidance. Most importantly, the collective wisdom of participants - from grassroots organizers to blockchain developers attending as guests to experienced web3 facilitators - created a knowledge commons that enriched everyone involved. The intervention design recognized this distributed expertise as a resource to be activated rather than a gap to be filled.

## Transformation Story

### Phase 1: Discovering Common Ground

The transformation began with careful preparation for the Gatherings series, recognizing that first impressions would shape everything that followed. The team of web3 facilitators spent weeks in planning sessions, wrestling with fundamental questions about how to create value for both Web3 innovators and grassroots sports organizations. Initial instincts pushed toward predetermined curricula that would educate each group about the other's domain. However, feedback from pre-gathering consultations revealed a different need entirely.

"We don't need another Web3 101 workshop," one grassroots organizer explained during a preparatory call. "We need to understand if this technology can actually help us serve our communities better." Similarly, blockchain developers invited to participate expressed fatigue with abstract discussions of potential impact. "Show us real problems we can solve," became a common refrain. These insights led to a crucial pivot: rather than teaching about each other's worlds, the Gatherings would create space for collaborative problem-solving.

Session 0, designed as a co-creation workshop, set the tone for everything that followed. Instead of presenting a fixed agenda, facilitators invited participants to share their most pressing challenges and explore where interests converged. The energy in the virtual room shifted palpably when a youth sports coordinator from an underserved community described their struggle with transparent fund allocation, and a blockchain developer immediately began sketching potential solutions. These moments of recognition - where abstract technical capabilities met concrete community needs - became the foundation for authentic collaboration.

The first phase also revealed unexpected dynamics around participation. The team had assumed consistent attendance across all sessions would indicate success. When participants instead chose to engage selectively based on relevance to their work, initial disappointment gave way to deeper understanding. Quality of engagement mattered more than quantity of attendance. Smaller groups allowed for more intimate conversations where participants felt safe expressing uncertainty and asking basic questions without judgment.

By the end of the first two Gatherings, patterns emerged that would shape the remainder of the series. Technical discussions needed careful facilitation to remain accessible without becoming superficial. Community voices required amplification to balance the confidence of tech-native participants. Most importantly, the magic happened not in formal presentations but in breakout rooms and informal conversations where relationships could develop organically.

### Phase 2: Structural Evolution

As relationships formed through the Gatherings, pressure mounted to address All In For Sport's structural challenges. The existing governance system, designed for a simpler NFT project, strained under the complexity of coordinating diverse activities. Weekly team meetings surfaced recurring tensions: how could the organization maintain coherent identity while supporting increasingly varied initiatives? How could operational decisions move quickly while respecting community governance? 

The introduction of the coordi-nations concept marked a turning point in organizational thinking. Rather than viewing these tensions as problems to solve, the framework reframed them as natural dynamics in network organizations. The metaphor resonated immediately with participants who had experienced similar challenges in other contexts. "It's like we've been trying to be a train when we needed to be a flock of birds," one contributor observed, capturing the shift from hierarchical to networked thinking.

Developing the AIFSIP-04 governance proposal became a collective sense-making exercise. Through multiple drafting sessions, the community worked to articulate the distinction between mission stewardship and operational execution. The process itself demonstrated the new governance principles in action: patient deliberation for fundamental decisions, rapid iteration for operational details. Contributors who had felt constrained by unclear authority began to see pathways for autonomous action within agreed boundaries.

The parallel evolution of Gatherings content and governance structure created reinforcing momentum. Insights from community conversations directly informed governance design. A gathering focused on sustainable funding models led to breakthrough thinking about resource-sharing between operational cells. Discussion of community ownership principles shaped accountability mechanisms in the new structure. This integration of learning with implementation accelerated transformation beyond what linear planning could have achieved.

External validation arrived at a crucial moment in this phase. Interest from various stakeholders in All In For Sport's emerging model provided both credibility and pressure to formalize the approach. Rather than reverting to traditional organizational forms to meet institutional expectations, the team used this opportunity to articulate the value of networked coordination. The successful communication of this novel structure to diverse audiences validated that the transformation addressed real needs beyond internal dynamics.

### Phase 3: Integration and Emergence

The final phase of transformation saw convergence of the various experimental threads into coherent organizational identity. The Gatherings series had created a community of practice spanning Web3 and grassroots sports. The governance transformation had established structures supporting this community. Now came the challenge of integration - ensuring these elements reinforced rather than competed with each other.

Unexpected partnerships emerged as natural outcomes of the transformation. Women Win, a global fund for women's sports, began their own Web3 exploration journey with All In For Sport as guide. The relationship demonstrated the coordi-nation model in practice: rather than providing consulting services, AIFS connected Women Win with relevant resources and communities while learning from their deep experience in feminist funding approaches. This reciprocal value creation validated the coordination model more powerfully than any theoretical argument.

The connection with Indigenous communities exploring blockchain for economic sovereignty revealed universal patterns transcending cultural contexts. Women in these communities faced remarkably similar challenges to urban sports organizations: need for transparent resource allocation, desire for community ownership, struggle with external funders' imposed priorities. These parallels suggested that All In For Sport's coordination role addressed systemic rather than situational needs.

Challenges persisted even as clarity emerged. The fundamental question of sustainable funding for coordination work remained largely unresolved. While operational cells could potentially generate revenue through specific projects, supporting the connective tissue between them required patient capital rarely available in either traditional or Web3 funding landscapes. Team discussions increasingly focused on this sustainability puzzle, recognizing it as not just All In For Sport's challenge but a sector-wide gap.

The transformation concluded not with triumphant resolution but with clear direction and continued questions. All In For Sport had successfully evolved from confused NFT project to confident coordi-nation. The organization could now articulate its value, demonstrate its impact, and operate through structures aligned with its purpose. Yet the journey revealed how organizational transformation, rather than reaching a final destination, opens new territories for exploration. The experiment validated the model while highlighting the ecosystem changes still needed for such models to thrive.

## Outcomes and Reflections

### What Changed

The transformation of All In For Sport produced measurable shifts across multiple dimensions, validating the intervention approach while revealing areas requiring continued attention. Quantitatively, the organization successfully completed five collaborative gatherings that brought together previously disconnected communities and established a new governance structure through the unanimous ratification of AIFSIP-04. These concrete achievements provided a foundation for future success that would become evident in subsequent months.

More significant than these measurable outcomes were the qualitative transformations in organizational culture and capability. The shift from product-centric to coordination-focused thinking represented a fundamental reorientation of purpose. Where once the organization struggled to explain its value proposition, team members could now articulate clearly how All In For Sport served as essential infrastructure connecting Web3 innovation with grassroots sports development. This clarity manifested in more coherent communications, stronger partner engagement, and increased confidence in pursuing opportunities aligned with the coordination mission.

The evolution of stakeholder relationships demonstrated the power of patient bridge-building work. Blockchain developers who participated in gatherings initially approached social impact as an abstract concept but gained deep appreciation for the complexities of community work. One developer reflected, "I came thinking I had solutions. I learned I barely understood the problems." Conversely, grassroots organizations moved from skepticism about blockchain technology to nuanced understanding of its potential applications. These shifts in perspective created conditions for authentic collaboration rather than transactional relationships.

Governance transformation yielded immediate operational benefits. The separation of community stewardship from operational execution resolved longstanding tensions about decision-making speed and authority. Operational cells could now pursue opportunities without lengthy deliberation processes, while community governance maintained focus on mission alignment and values protection. This structural clarity reduced friction and enabled more strategic deployment of limited resources.

Perhaps most importantly, the experiment catalyzed ecosystem-level changes beyond All In For Sport itself. Partner organizations began their own explorations of Web3 applications, inspired by AIFS's journey. The Gatherings methodology was adapted by other groups seeking to bridge technical and community divides. The coordi-nations model entered broader discourse about organizational futures in networked societies. These ripple effects suggested that All In For Sport's transformation addressed needs felt across multiple sectors.

### What We Learned

The experiment surfaced crucial insights about organizational transformation in the Web3 era that extend beyond All In For Sport's specific context. First and most fundamentally, the journey demonstrated that coordination creates more value than direct service delivery in nascent ecosystems. While the original NFT model attempted to provide direct funding to sports programs, the coordination approach multiplied impact by enabling numerous connections and collaborations that wouldn't have occurred otherwise. This insight challenges prevalent assumptions about organizational value, suggesting that in complex adaptive systems, the connective tissue between actors matters as much as the actors themselves.

The experience revealed that authentic transformation requires letting go of predetermined outcomes and remaining genuinely open to emergence. All In For Sport's willingness to abandon its original NFT-focused model when evidence showed it wasn't serving community needs exemplified this principle. Many organizations facing similar identity crises double down on failing approaches rather than risk the uncertainty of fundamental change. The courage to release attachment to specific solutions while maintaining commitment to underlying purpose enabled breakthrough discoveries about the organization's true value.

Practical learnings about multi-stakeholder engagement proved immediately applicable to other contexts. The initial assumption that everyone should participate in every activity reflected good intentions about inclusivity but created frustration for participants with limited time and specific interests. Accepting selective engagement as a feature rather than a bug required reframing success metrics from attendance numbers to quality of participation. This insight helped design better engagement pathways that respected participants' constraints while maintaining community coherence.

The experiment validated that bridging technical and community knowledge gaps requires more than translation - it demands creating entirely new spaces where different forms of expertise are equally valued. Traditional approaches often position one group as teachers and another as students, reinforcing power imbalances. The Gatherings' emphasis on mutual learning and collaborative problem-solving demonstrated an alternative where technical knowledge and community wisdom enhanced rather than competed with each other.

Critical insights emerged about the chronic underfunding of coordination work in both traditional nonprofit and Web3 contexts. While funders readily support direct service delivery or technical innovation, the patient relationship-building and infrastructure development that enables these activities remains largely unvalued. This systemic gap creates sustainability challenges for organizations like All In For Sport that provide essential but often invisible coordination services.

### Critical Reflections

Honest assessment of the experiment reveals significant shortcomings alongside celebrated successes. The persistent challenge of financial sustainability casts a shadow over other achievements. Despite validating the coordination model and demonstrating clear value, All In For Sport still relies heavily on volunteer contributions and grant funding. The inability to develop sustainable revenue models raises questions about the long-term viability of coordination-focused organizations in current economic structures.

Stakeholder confusion about roles and resources throughout much of the experiment highlighted communication failures that better planning might have prevented. The assumption that the Reimagining Power Project's funding would flow directly to stakeholder experiments created false expectations and required mid-course corrections. While these misunderstandings were eventually resolved, they consumed energy and created unnecessary tension. Future initiatives would benefit from explicit upfront conversations about resource allocation and role definitions.

The challenge of balancing inclusivity with specialized engagement remained only partially resolved. While the insight about selective participation represented progress, designing truly effective multi-pathway engagement models proved more complex than anticipated. Some technical participants still felt conversations remained too basic, while some community organizations found even simplified blockchain discussions overwhelming. The sweet spot of productive discomfort - where all participants stretch without breaking - remained elusive.

Questions persist about the scalability of the coordination model. All In For Sport's transformation succeeded within a relatively small, high-trust network where relationships could develop organically. Whether similar approaches can work at larger scales or in lower-trust environments remains untested. The intensive facilitation and relationship-building required may not be economically viable beyond experimental contexts.

The experiment also revealed uncomfortable truths about the pace of meaningful change. While the six-month intensive period produced significant transformation, building the relationships and trust necessary for authentic collaboration cannot be rushed. This temporal reality conflicts with funding cycles, participant availability, and the general acceleration of organizational life. Reconciling the slow pace of relationship-building with urgent community needs and rapid technological change presents ongoing challenges.

## Assessment & Evolution

### Pattern Performance

The evaluation of chosen patterns and approaches reveals nuanced outcomes that inform future practice. The Gatherings pattern proved exceptionally effective for its intended purpose of creating bridges between diverse stakeholder groups. The emphasis on emergence over predetermined outcomes allowed authentic relationships to develop while maintaining sufficient structure for productivity. Participants consistently reported that the gatherings felt different from typical Web3 meetups or nonprofit convening spaces, creating what one participant called "productive discomfort" that sparked new thinking.

Necessary adaptations to the Gatherings pattern included more explicit separation of technical and community-focused sessions than originally envisioned. The initial attempt to serve all audiences simultaneously diluted value for everyone. The evolved approach maintained connection points between tracks while allowing appropriate depth for different conversations. This adaptation suggests that effective bridging requires strategic separation alongside intentional integration.

The coordi-nations model exceeded expectations in providing philosophical clarity and structural coherence to All In For Sport's transformation. The framework's power lay not in prescriptive rules but in offering a new metaphor for organizational identity. Thinking of themselves as a network of aligned communities rather than a single entity resolved longstanding tensions and opened creative possibilities. The model's flexibility allowed for contextual adaptation while maintaining core principles of autonomy within alignment.

Implementation of the cell structure pattern yielded mixed results that highlight the importance of sequencing in organizational transformation. While the governance framework established clear parameters for operational cells, actual cell formation proceeded more slowly than anticipated. This lag revealed that structural change must be supported by cultural shifts and practical resources. Creating policies for autonomous cells proved easier than fostering the entrepreneurial energy and resources needed for cells to thrive.

Unexpected pattern applications emerged through participant innovation. The Gatherings methodology was adapted by partner organizations for their own stakeholder engagement processes. The coordi-nations framework influenced how other DAOs began thinking about their organizational structures. These organic adoptions validated the patterns' utility beyond All In For Sport's specific context while revealing how knowledge spreads through networks rather than formal dissemination.

### Sustainability and Continuation

The question of what persists beyond the formal experiment period provides crucial indicators of genuine transformation versus temporary intervention effects. Most encouraging is the fundamental shift in organizational identity and purpose that appears deeply embedded in All In For Sport's culture. Team members consistently articulate the coordination mission when discussing new opportunities, suggesting internalization rather than mere compliance with new messaging. This clarity provides a north star for future decisions even as specific strategies evolve.

Community ownership of the transformation manifests in how stakeholders beyond the core team champion the coordi-nation model. Partner organizations reference All In For Sport as an exemplar of networked coordination. Gathering participants maintain connections formed during the series, creating ongoing value beyond formal programming. This distributed ownership suggests sustainability through network effects rather than dependence on central coordination.

Institutional shifts supporting continuation include the ratified governance structure that provides clear frameworks for future evolution. Unlike informal agreements that depend on specific personalities, the documented governance model creates institutional memory transcending individual participation. The successful navigation of stakeholder engagement demonstrates that the model can interface with traditional institutions while maintaining its innovative character.

Resources and structures created during the experiment provide foundation for ongoing work. The Gathering recordings serve as educational resources for new participants. Documentation of the governance transformation offers templates for other organizations. Relationships with funders interested in supporting coordination work create potential revenue streams. While none of these elements guarantee sustainability, together they improve prospects for continuation.

The evolution of work beyond the experiment already shows promising directions. New operational cells are forming around specific opportunities, suggesting the governance framework enables rather than constrains innovation. Conversations with potential funding partners explore how to value coordination infrastructure appropriately. Most significantly, the questions driving organizational development have shifted from "what are we?" to "how can we serve?" - indicating maturation from identity crisis to purpose-driven evolution.

The true validation of the coordi-nation model came months after the formal experiment concluded, through participation in the IOC's tech365 grant program. This externally-run competitive grant campaign provided an ideal testing ground for the operational cell structure. A diverse group of allied organizations - Sarreya Sport, Love Futbol, Bonito Foundation, and All In For Sport - formed a collaborative cell within the AIFS coordi-nation framework. The cell structure enabled these organizations to coordinate effectively despite being competitors in a global grant program, combining their strengths while fairly navigating grant requirements.

The results exceeded all expectations. Working within the supportive environment of All In For Sport's coordi-nation, the collaborative cell secured the expertise needed to coordinate their efforts, strategically aligned their proposals, and ultimately won the grant round with more votes than any other project. This success demonstrated that the governance transformation had created lasting infrastructure capable of enabling real-world outcomes. More importantly, the participating organizations were able to self-organize confidently for project execution, validating that the coordi-nation model provides both structure and liberation for collective action.

### Transferable Insights

The All In For Sport experiment generated insights valuable for diverse organizations navigating similar challenges at the intersection of technological innovation and social purpose. Core principles that transcend context include the recognition that unclear value propositions often signal misalignment with ecosystem needs rather than communication failures. Organizations struggling to explain their worth might need fundamental transformation rather than better marketing. The journey also demonstrates that patient relationship-building, while seemingly inefficient, creates more lasting value than rushed implementation of predetermined solutions.

Adaptation strategies for different settings must account for varying levels of technological sophistication, cultural contexts, and resource availability. Organizations with strong technical capabilities might begin with governance transformation while building community relationships. Those with deep community roots might start with relationship-strengthening gatherings while gradually introducing structural innovations. The key lies in reading existing organizational assets and constraints to determine appropriate entry points.

Minimum viable conditions for success include committed leadership willing to release attachment to original visions, sufficient trust within stakeholder networks to weather uncertainty, and patient funding that allows for emergence rather than demanding predetermined outcomes. Without these foundational elements, organizations may achieve surface changes without deeper transformation. The experiment suggests that trying to force transformation without these conditions wastes resources and relationships.

Warning signs that indicate need for course correction include persistent stakeholder confusion despite repeated explanations, difficulty attracting participants to engagement activities, and team exhaustion from trying to be everything to everyone. These symptoms often indicate fundamental misalignment requiring strategic pivot rather than tactical adjustment. All In For Sport's willingness to recognize and respond to these signals enabled successful transformation where stubbornness might have led to organizational failure.

The quick wins versus long-term investment calculus revealed by the experiment helps organizations plan realistic transformation journeys. Quick wins included clarified messaging, improved team morale from having clear purpose, and early partnership interest from aligned organizations. Long-term investments in relationship building, governance restructuring, and culture change required months to show results but created more lasting value. Organizations must balance these timeframes to maintain momentum while building for sustainability.

### Knowledge Contribution

The All In For Sport experiment advances collective understanding of organizational transformation in networked societies. The validation of coordination as essential infrastructure challenges dominant narratives about organizational value. Traditional metrics focusing on direct service delivery or product innovation miss the crucial role of connection and facilitation in complex ecosystems. This experiment provides concrete evidence that coordination functions deserve recognition and resources equal to more visible activities.

Novel combinations emerged from bringing together Web3 governance innovations with community organizing principles. The coordi-nation model represents neither pure decentralization nor traditional hierarchy but a hybrid suited to bridging diverse communities. This synthesis suggests possibilities for organizational forms that transcend current categories, maintaining benefits of decentralized participation while providing sufficient structure for effective action.

Emergent patterns worth documenting include the relationship between organizational clarity and stakeholder engagement. As All In For Sport's identity crystallized, partner interest increased dramatically. This correlation suggests that authentic organizational identity, even if unconventional, attracts more support than trying to appeal to everyone. The pattern of selective participation improving outcome quality also merits wider recognition, challenging assumptions about inclusive process design.

Theoretical insights from practice include recognition that transformation happens through parallel cultural and structural change. Neither alone suffices - culture without structure lacks sustainability while structure without culture creates empty frameworks. The experiment also reveals that bridging work requires creating new spaces rather than simply translating between existing ones. These insights contribute to organizational theory while remaining grounded in practical experience.

Questions for further exploration proliferate from the experiment's findings. How might artificial intelligence tools reduce coordination overhead while maintaining relational quality? What economic models appropriately value coordination infrastructure in market systems designed for direct exchange? How do coordi-nations maintain coherence as they scale beyond high-trust networks? These questions invite continued experimentation and research building on All In For Sport's foundation.

## Conclusion

All In For Sport's transformation from struggling NFT project to thriving coordi-nation illuminates both the challenges and possibilities of organizational evolution in an era of technological disruption and social need. The journey demonstrates that authentic transformation requires courage to abandon failing models, patience to build genuine relationships across difference, and wisdom to recognize that the most valuable contributions often lie in connecting rather than creating.

The experiment's success in clarifying organizational identity, establishing sustainable governance structures, and building bridges between previously disconnected communities offers hope for others facing similar challenges. Yet the persistent struggle to fund coordination work reveals systemic gaps in how society values essential infrastructure. This tension between validated need and economic sustainability represents not just All In For Sport's challenge but a broader question about how to support the connective tissue that enables innovation and impact.

For organizations standing at their own crossroads between technological possibility and community need, All In For Sport's journey offers both inspiration and practical guidance. Start with genuine listening rather than predetermined solutions. Create spaces for emergence while maintaining sufficient structure for progress. Recognize that transformation happens through parallel cultural and structural change. Most importantly, trust that clarity comes through action and reflection rather than strategic planning alone.

The invitation extends beyond individual organizations to the broader ecosystem. Funders must recognize coordination as essential infrastructure deserving patient capital. Technical innovators need to approach community challenges with humility and willingness to learn. Community organizations can explore new tools while maintaining focus on human needs. Together, these actors can create conditions where coordi-nations like All In For Sport not only survive but thrive.

As All In For Sport continues its evolution, new questions emerge about scale, sustainability, and impact. The organization stands ready to explore these frontiers not alone but as part of a growing network of practitioners committed to reimagining how power flows through our technological and social systems. The transformation documented here represents not an ending but a beginning - an invitation to join in the patient work of building bridges that enable collective flourishing.
