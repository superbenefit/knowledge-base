# All In For Sport Case Study Enhancement Requirements

## Executive Overview

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the All In For Sport case study based on the Phase 3 Quality Enhancement review. The enhancements focus on three primary areas: strengthening narrative coherence, expanding pattern documentation, and developing visual communication elements. The following sections detail specific recommendations, information gaps that need to be addressed, and additional materials required for implementation.

## Enhancement Recommendations

### Narrative Coherence Improvements

The primary narrative enhancement involves strengthening the connection between the transformation activities and outcomes analysis. Currently, the case study moves from describing specific transformation events to analyzing broader impacts without sufficient transitional material. This enhancement would add a bridging section that explicitly connects the final transformation phase to the outcomes, helping readers understand how specific activities produced the documented results.

Additionally, the relationship between the Gatherings series and governance transformation requires more explicit connection throughout the narrative. While the case study mentions these parallel interventions, readers would benefit from concrete examples showing how insights from Gatherings directly influenced governance decisions and vice versa. This enhancement would weave these connections throughout the relevant sections rather than treating them as separate streams of activity.

### Pattern Documentation Expansion

The pattern documentation requires significant expansion to provide actionable guidance for practitioners. The cell structure pattern currently lacks operational detail beyond the tech365 validation example. The enhancement would document early cell formation attempts, operational challenges encountered, and practical lessons learned. This expansion would transform theoretical pattern descriptions into practical implementation guidance.

The resource-sharing mechanisms pattern represents a critical gap in current documentation. Given that sustainable funding remains unresolved, documenting attempted approaches and their limitations would provide valuable learning for others facing similar challenges. This enhancement would include specific details about proposed resource-sharing models, implementation attempts, and analysis of why these mechanisms proved insufficient.

A new summary section would consolidate all patterns attempted during the experiment, providing practitioners with a quick reference guide for implementation. This section would include adaptation strategies, performance assessments, and contextual considerations for each pattern.

### Visual Communication Development

Five strategic visualizations would significantly enhance comprehension and accessibility of the case study's key concepts and findings. These visualizations would serve different audiences and purposes while maintaining consistency in design approach:

• **Transformation Timeline**: An illustrated timeline showing the parallel progression of Gatherings and governance changes throughout the experiment period, including key milestones, decision points, and interactions between intervention streams

• **Stakeholder Ecosystem Map**: A visual representation of the complex relationships between different participant groups and All In For Sport's coordination role, replacing several paragraphs of explanatory text

• **Coordi-nations Model Diagram**: A comparative visualization showing traditional organizational hierarchy alongside the networked cell structure, demonstrating how operational autonomy and mission alignment coexist

• **Before-and-After Comparison Chart**: A summary of transformation outcomes presenting quantitative metrics, qualitative shifts, and stakeholder benefits in an accessible format for funders and decision-makers

• **Gatherings Process Flow**: Diagrams showing the evolution from predetermined curricula to emergent collaborative problem-solving, providing practical guidance for replication

## Additional Information to Gather

### Timeline Data

The transformation timeline visualization requires specific dates for key events throughout the experiment period. These chronological markers will help readers understand the pace and sequence of organizational change:

• Dates for each Gathering session (0-5) and the primary topics or themes covered
• Key governance meetings and decisions, particularly those leading to AIFSIP-04 development
• The proposal and ratification timeline for AIFSIP-04
• Partnership development milestones, including initial contact and formal collaboration with organizations like Women Win
• Other significant organizational events during late 2023 to mid-2024 that influenced the transformation

### Quantitative Metrics

The before-and-after comparison requires quantitative data to complement the qualitative transformation story. These metrics will provide concrete evidence of organizational change and help readers assess the transformation's scale and impact:

• Number of active contributors before and after transformation
• Volunteer hours contributed during different phases of the experiment
• Participant numbers for each Gathering session, showing engagement patterns
• Number of new partnership relationships formed
• Financial metrics (if available), such as funds raised, distributed, or contributed
• Community engagement metrics from Discord, governance forums, or other platforms
• Participation rates in governance decisions before and after structural changes

### Stakeholder Details

The ecosystem map requires a comprehensive list of all stakeholder organizations involved beyond those currently mentioned in the case study. For each stakeholder organization, we need to understand their organizational type and primary mission to properly categorize them in the ecosystem. Their specific role in the All In For Sport ecosystem and how they engaged with the transformation process would inform the visualization. The nature of their relationship with AIFS, whether as participants, partners, or observers, would determine their positioning in the ecosystem map. Understanding their level of engagement throughout the transformation, including any changes in involvement over time, would add valuable context to the visualization.

### Pattern Implementation Details

Each pattern implemented during the experiment requires additional documentation to strengthen the case study's contribution to collective knowledge. This detailed information would help practitioners understand not just what patterns were used, but how they were adapted and implemented in practice:

• **Adaptation Decisions**: Specific modifications made to each pattern for the All In For Sport context, including rationale for changes
• **Implementation Timeline**: Phases and milestones for rolling out each pattern, providing realistic expectations for similar efforts
• **Resource Requirements**: Human, technical, and financial resources needed for each pattern implementation
• **Success Metrics**: How success was defined for each pattern and whether these metrics were achieved
• **Implementation Challenges**: Obstacles encountered during pattern implementation and how they were addressed
• **Lessons Learned**: Practical insights that would help future practitioners avoid common pitfalls or accelerate implementation

### Visual References

To ensure accuracy in visual development, any existing diagrams, sketches, or visual representations created during the experiment would be valuable references. This includes any working drawings of the coordi-nations model, governance structure diagrams, or stakeholder relationship maps that may have been developed for internal use. Brand guidelines or visual preferences for All In For Sport would ensure that visualizations align with organizational identity. Understanding any specific visual metaphors or representations that resonated with stakeholders during the experiment would help create meaningful and recognizable visualizations.

## Implementation Approach with Discovered Documentation

The search through AIFS documentation has revealed substantial information that addresses many gaps identified in the enhancement requirements. The following implementation instructions integrate these findings with specific file references to guide the enhancement process.

### Timeline Clarification and Data Integration

The OTF report (notes/aifs/reporting/otf-report.md) provides critical timeline clarification that must be reconciled with the case study. The report indicates gatherings ran from October 2024 to April 2025, which conflicts with the case study's stated timeframe of "late 2023 to mid 2024." This discrepancy requires investigation to determine whether there were multiple phases of gatherings or if the case study contains an error. The specific gathering dates documented in the gatherings sessions strategy (notes/aifs/gathering-planning/gatherings-sessions-strategy.md) should be used to create an accurate timeline visualization: November 13, December 11, January 8, January 22, February 5, and March 19.

The quantitative metrics discovered in the OTF report provide concrete data for the before-and-after comparison visualization. The enhancement should incorporate the finding that 111 participants from 38 organizations engaged across 6 gatherings, exceeding the original 5-gathering target. The multiple platform development including Discord, LinkedIn, and the dedicated video archive at watch.allinforsport.org demonstrates the technical infrastructure evolution that should be highlighted in the case study.

### Narrative Coherence Enhancement

The gathering planning documents reveal clear connections between the gatherings and governance transformation that can strengthen narrative coherence. The progression from Session 0's participatory design approach (notes/aifs/gathering-planning/aifs-gathering-0-cocreating-program.md) through to Gathering 2's focus on community governance (notes/aifs/gathering-planning/aifs-gathering-2-community-governance.md) shows how stakeholder input directly shaped both the gathering content and organizational governance discussions. These connections should be woven throughout the transformation story to demonstrate the parallel evolution of both interventions.

The poetic harvests (notes/aifs/poetic-harvests/) provide rich qualitative data that can enhance the narrative with authentic participant voices. For example, the Gathering 1 harvest (notes/aifs/poetic-harvests/gathering-1-11-dec-24.md) captures the community's exploration of "shifting power from centralized entities to communities" and "mobilizing capital collectively, equitably," themes that directly connect to the governance transformation work.

### Pattern Documentation Expansion

The final retrospective (notes/aifs/feedback/final-retro.md) provides detailed insights about pattern implementation that should be incorporated into the enhanced documentation. The poetic harvesting pattern emerged as a particularly successful innovation, described as "the perfect touch for those along all of the workshop levels to plug into." This pattern's implementation details, including how it transcended traditional note-taking to capture emotional and aspirational elements, should be documented as a transferable practice.

The gatherings pattern implementation revealed important adaptations documented in the retrospective. The team learned to adjust content accessibility after Session 0 revealed material was too high-level, demonstrating the importance of iterative design. The consistent team structure with distributed roles (facilitator, community weavers, poetic harvester, tech support) proved effective and should be documented as part of the pattern implementation guidance.

The OTF report documents concrete outcomes from the coordination pattern, including two community projects that received Giveth platform funding as direct results of gathering connections: "Every Court Can Dream" and "Huottoja University of Ancestral Knowledge." These examples provide tangible evidence of the coordi-nation model's effectiveness in enabling real-world outcomes.

### Visual Enhancement Implementation

The discovered documentation provides specific data points for all proposed visualizations. The transformation timeline can now be accurately constructed using the gathering dates from the sessions strategy document and the governance milestones implied in the case study. The stakeholder ecosystem map can be enriched with the 38 organizations mentioned in the OTF report, though individual organization names would need to be extracted from gathering recordings or registration data.

The before-and-after comparison chart can now include concrete metrics: growth from initial AIFS contributors to 111 gathering participants, evolution from single-platform communication to multi-platform engagement including Discord, LinkedIn, and dedicated video archive, and progression from unclear purpose to validated coordination model with IOC Tech365 recognition. The gatherings process flow can illustrate the evolution from predetermined Session 0 agenda to emergent, participant-driven content based on the planning documents' run-of-show comparisons.

### Additional Implementation Considerations

The retrospective's "Longed For" section provides forward-looking insights that should inform the case study's conclusion and future directions. Team members expressed specific desires for project implementation with partners, continuation of gatherings, and development of local language sessions. These aspirations provide concrete examples of how the coordi-nation model might evolve beyond the experiment period.

The IOC Tech365 validation gains important context from the OTF report, which clarifies that AIFS offered their Discord as a collaboration space for all 25 Tech365 participants from 16 countries. This demonstrates the coordi-nation model extending beyond the initial experiment to serve a broader international community, providing strong evidence for the model's scalability and continued relevance.
