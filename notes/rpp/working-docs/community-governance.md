**Community governance** enables broad networks of stakeholders to collectively steward shared [resources](tags/resources.md) and guide organizational evolution through transparent, participatory [[decision-making]] processes at the [constituency scale](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-scale/constituency.md).

related to:
- [Multi-Stakeholder Governance](notes/rpp/working-docs/stakeholder-governance.md)
- [Operational Governance](notes/rpp/working-docs/operational-governance.md)

This pattern provides a [framework](tags/frameworks.md) for implementing inclusive, transparent, and [sustainable](tags/sustainability.md) governance systems that safeguard organizational [purpose](tags/purpose.md) while enabling [community](tags/community.md)-driven evolution.

## Problem / Solution Context

The Problem/Solution Context section should explore:

1. Legacy Challenges in Community Governance
   * Concentration of power in traditional governance structures
   * Exclusion of community voices from decision-making
   * Misalignment between community needs and organizational direction
   * Barriers to meaningful participation and engagement
   * Challenges in maintaining long-term community alignment

2. Existing Community Governance Approaches
   * Traditional membership organizations
   * Cooperative and collective governance models
   * Digital community governance systems
   * Recent innovations in participatory decision-making
   * Strengths and limitations of current approaches
   * Gaps that remain unaddressed

3. Web3 Opportunities
   * How blockchain enables transparent community governance
   * Token-based voting and delegation systems
   * Mechanisms for sustainable community engagement
   * Infrastructure requirements for constituency-scale participation
   * Integration with existing community systems

This section should emphasize how community governance represents an evolution in collective decision-making, particularly in enabling sustained community participation while preserving organizational purpose.

## How Community Governance Works

Community governance is implemented through a deliberate process that begins with community formation and engagement, moves through participatory system design, and culminates in the deployment of technical infrastructure that enables sustained collective stewardship. This approach ensures both broad participation and purposeful evolution while maintaining focus on long-term sustainability.

### Mechanism

The implementation of community governance follows three key phases:

1. Community Formation and Engagement
   * Building shared purpose and values
   * Establishing participation frameworks
   * Creating engagement incentives
   * Developing communication channels
   * Fostering community culture

2. Governance System Design
   * Designing participation mechanisms
   * Creating decision-making processes
   * Establishing resource stewardship protocols
   * Building consensus mechanisms
   * Developing evolution pathways
   * Documentation of governance framework

3. Technical Infrastructure Development
   * Implementing voting and delegation systems
   * Creating community coordination tools
   * Building transparency mechanisms
   * Establishing feedback loops
   * Setting up monitoring systems

### Operationalizing the Governance System

This section should describe how the community governance system functions in practice. Writers should:

1. Explain how proposals, decisions, and resources flow through the community governance system, focusing on both participation and stewardship.

2. Map governance flows showing how the community participates, decisions are made, and evolution occurs. Include process diagrams where helpful.

3. Detail technical implementations, including voting systems, delegation mechanisms, and transparency tools.

4. Provide practical examples demonstrating how communities govern effectively at scale.

Focus on creating clear, actionable documentation that helps readers understand both social and technical aspects of implementation.

## Community Governance in Practice

### Implementation Strategies

Document the practical steps for organizations adopting community governance. Writers should:

1. Describe the preparation phase, including community assessment, participation design, and initial engagement strategies.

2. Outline the implementation process, from community formation through full governance activation.

3. Provide guidance on maintaining engagement, evaluating effectiveness, and evolving the system.

### Required Primitives

For each primitive required by this pattern, writers should explain:
1. The primitive's role in enabling community governance
2. How it interacts with other governance components
3. Key considerations for implementation
4. Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

Focus on practical guidance drawn from real implementations, using concrete examples to illustrate successful approaches.

## Resources and References

Writers should compile relevant resources that help readers implement and understand community governance. Include:

1. Essential reading on community governance frameworks and implementation
2. Technical documentation for key tools and platforms
3. Notable research and case studies
4. Active communities and support channels

Keep the resource list focused and practical, prioritizing materials that provide direct implementation value.
