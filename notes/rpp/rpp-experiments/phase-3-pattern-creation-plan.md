# RPP Pattern Improvement - Phase 3 Execution Plan

## Current Status Assessment

### Existing Pattern Documentation Found
- `artifacts/patterns/gatherings.md` - Already well-documented with RPP examples
- Working docs with patterns needing enhancement/relocation:
  - `operational-governance.md` (outline)
  - `community-governance.md` (fairly complete)
  - `token-based-governance.md` (complete)
  - `multistakeholder-governance.md` (outline)
  - `privacy-payments.md` (fairly complete)
- DAO Primitives patterns exist (cells, DAO State, etc.)

### Missing Patterns Confirmed from Phase 2
- **Coordi-nations** (HIGHEST priority - central to AIFS)
- **Impact Attestations** (HIGH - pattern that includes hypercerts as one implementation)
- **Peer to peer payments** (HIGH - core to Equality Fund)
- **Participatory governance** (HIGH - for Equality Fund)
- **Opportunistic Adoption** (MEDIUM - from ICS)
- **DisCo pattern** (MEDIUM - referenced by Equality Fund)

## Phase 3 Execution Strategy

### 1. Create Coordi-nations Pattern (HIGHEST Priority)
**Rationale**: Central to AIFS transformation, extensively documented in case study

**Approach**:
- Extract information from AIFS case study where it's extensively documented
- Use the pattern template and creation workflow
- Focus on practical implementation from AIFS experience
- Include the 7-step framework mentioned in the case study
- Document how AIFS implemented 6 of 7 steps

**Key content to include**:
- Definition of network sovereignty through voluntary association
- The 7-step process for building coordi-nations
- AIFS's practical implementation example
- Contrast with network states and traditional hierarchies

### 2. Enhance and Relocate Existing Patterns (HIGH Priority)

#### Operational Governance
- Add AIFS examples (AIFSIP-04 separation of operations from community stewardship)
- Complete missing sections using the outline structure
- Move from working docs to artifacts/patterns
- Focus on how autonomous teams coordinate around shared resources

#### Community Governance
- Add AIFS examples of mission protection and values alignment
- Ensure proper format alignment with template
- Move from working docs to artifacts/patterns
- Include the various scale patterns already documented

### 3. Create Impact Attestations Pattern (HIGH Priority)
**Important clarification**: Hypercerts are a specific implementation of impact attestations

**Approach**:
- Define impact attestations as the general pattern for on-chain impact documentation
- Include hypercerts as one example implementation (used by ICS)
- Extract information from ICS case study
- Focus on how blockchain enables transparent impact tracking
- Include other potential implementations beyond hypercerts

### 4. Create Peer to peer payments Pattern (HIGH Priority)
**Rationale**: Core to Equality Fund experiment

**Approach**:
- Extract from Equality Fund case study
- Focus on blockchain for international fund transfers
- Address the critical challenges they faced (last-mile delivery, local context)
- Note: Privacy payments pattern already exists in working docs - ensure these are distinguished

### 5. Create Participatory governance Pattern (HIGH Priority)
**Rationale**: Key to Equality Fund's approach

**Approach**:
- Extract from Equality Fund's stakeholder involvement approaches
- Focus on involving affected communities in decisions
- Distinguish from general community governance (this is more specific to decision processes)

### 6. Handle MEDIUM Priority Patterns (if time permits)

#### Opportunistic Adoption
- Extract from ICS experience
- Focus on flexible approach to Web3 adoption responding to opportunities
- Document how ICS pivoted based on what worked

#### DisCo Pattern
- Research external reference (https://www.disco.coop/)
- Focus on Distributed Cooperative Organization model
- Note how Equality Fund considered this approach

## Key Implementation Principles

1. **Use existing content**: Extract extensively from case studies rather than inventing new content
2. **Follow templates strictly**: Use the pattern template structure exactly
3. **Maintain RPP focus**: Ensure all examples and context relate to the Reimagining Power experiments
4. **Create working artifacts**: Draft in artifacts for review before saving
5. **Be thorough but concise**: Include all necessary sections without unnecessary elaboration
6. **Respect terminology**: Don't rename things (e.g., hypercerts remain hypercerts, they're just one type of impact attestation)

## Execution Order

1. **Start with Coordi-nations** - highest priority, best documented
2. **Enhance operational & community governance** - already partially complete
3. **Create impact attestations** - clarifies hypercerts relationship
4. **Create peer to peer payments** - addresses Equality Fund needs
5. **Create participatory governance** - completes Equality Fund patterns
6. **Address medium priorities if time allows**

## Success Criteria

- All patterns follow the established template exactly
- Each pattern includes concrete RPP experiment examples
- Patterns in working docs are enhanced and relocated to artifacts/patterns
- Clear distinctions between similar patterns (e.g., privacy payments vs peer to peer payments)
- Terminology is consistent and accurate (e.g., hypercerts as a type of impact attestation)

## CRITICAL FILE HANDLING DIRECTIVES

### MANDATORY Safeguards for All Future Pattern Work

**1. NEVER Overwrite Existing Files**
- Only add specific sections when enhancing
- Make targeted edits to specific text only
- Create new files only where none exist
- If a file exists, READ IT FIRST before any action

**2. Quality Standards**
- NO outline-style notes or placeholder text
- NO draft-quality work in deliverables
- ALL content must be complete, polished, and professional
- Match or exceed the quality of existing patterns

**3. File Operations Protocol**
- READ files before editing to understand existing content
- PRESERVE all existing high-quality content
- SHOW content in artifacts for review before saving
- VERIFY quality matches existing patterns before saving

**4. Specific Action Rules**
- **Relocate**: Copy content EXACTLY with zero edits
- **Enhance**: Add only what's missing, preserve everything else
- **Create New**: Match quality and style of best existing patterns

**5. Verification Requirements**
- Read file after writing to ensure quality improvement
- Compare before/after to confirm no degradation
- Get confirmation before permanent saves
- If uncertain about quality, ASK before saving

### Consequences of Violations
Failure to follow these directives causes:
- Week+ delays in critical project timelines
- Loss of trust and credibility
- Destruction of carefully crafted content
- Need for extensive rework and recovery

These directives are PERMANENT and apply to ALL future work on this project.
