# Summary

This proposal seeks to establish a formal separation between community governance and operational activities within All In For Sport. By distinguishing these domains of authority, we create a framework allowing autonomous operational cells to function under the AIFS brand while maintaining alignment with our purpose. Community governance retains stewardship over the DAO's mission and brand identity.

## Glossary

**UNA/TUNAA**: Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Agreement  
**Cell**: Autonomous workgroup within the DAO structure  
**SuperBenefit**: Partner organization providing administrative support for AIFS operational activities

# Details

AIFSIP-04 establishes a practical framework to separate decision-making within AIFS into two complementary domains: community governance and operational execution. Community governance will focus on mission, purpose, and brand stewardship, while operational teams gain the autonomy needed to execute projects effectively.

It establishes clear boundaries of authority, transparent reporting requirements, and sustainable funding mechanisms that benefit the entire ecosystem.
