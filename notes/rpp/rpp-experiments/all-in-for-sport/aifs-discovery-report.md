## Executive Summary

All In For Sport (AIFS) stands at a critical juncture in its organizational evolution. Originally conceived as an NFT project modeled after NounsDAO to fund grassroots sports initiatives, the organization has discovered that its initial product-centric approach faces significant barriers to effectively serving marginalized communities. Through extensive stakeholder engagement and internal reflection, AIFS has identified that its value may lie not in direct fundraising through digital assets, but in serving as a coordination layer that connects Web3 innovation with grassroots sports development needs.

The Discovery process revealed three primary systemic challenges: an unclear value proposition that makes communication with funders and partners difficult, the need for a sustainable coordination model that doesn't rely entirely on volunteer effort, and the challenge of simultaneously serving technical Web3 audiences and grassroots sports organizations with vastly different knowledge bases and needs. Despite these challenges, stakeholder feedback demonstrates high enthusiasm from the Web3 community and growing interest from sports organizations in exploring how emerging technologies might address longstanding issues in sports philanthropy.

The organization shows strong readiness for transformation, with deeply committed contributors who have weathered the challenging journey from NFT project to emergent purpose. Stakeholders have identified coordination, community governance, and innovative funding models as primary areas of interest, suggesting a path forward that leverages AIFS's unique position at the intersection of sports and Web3 technology.

## 1. Organizational Context and Profile

### Organization Overview

All In For Sport emerged as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with an ambitious vision to revolutionize grassroots sports funding through Web3 technologies. Operating as a distributed collective, AIFS maintains a small but dedicated group of active contributors, having refined its focus from a larger initial group. This reduction reflects not organizational failure but rather a natural refinement process as the organization navigated the complex challenge of bridging blockchain technology with community sports development.

The organization's decentralized structure represents both innovation and challenge. While providing a framework for distributed decision-making and transparent resource allocation, it also creates communication barriers with traditional funders and sports organizations unfamiliar with blockchain governance models. The current contributor base, though smaller than at founding, demonstrates exceptional commitment and expertise at the intersection of Web3 technology and social impact.

### Mission and Current Focus

AIFS's mission centers on creating a "coordi-nation" for community-led projects that advance inclusion and empowerment through sport. This represents an evolution from their original mission of NFT-based fundraising to a more nuanced understanding of their role as facilitators and connectors. The coordi-nation model focuses on networking aligned communities around shared purpose and commonly held resources. The organization recognizes sport's unique ability to unite people across boundaries and seeks to leverage Web3 technologies to redistribute power and resources equitably to communities.

The shift in focus reflects deep learning about the limitations of imposing technological solutions on communities without adequate consideration of their actual needs and capacities. Current priorities include understanding how to serve as an effective coordination layer, building bridges between technical and grassroots communities, and developing sustainable models for decentralized sports philanthropy.

### Recent Context and Environment

The organization operates within the growing intersection of sports for development and Web3 innovation. External factors include increasing interest from traditional sports funders in blockchain applications, growing awareness of the limitations of traditional philanthropic models, and the emergence of other organizations exploring similar territory. This context creates both competitive pressure and collaborative opportunities.

### Target Communities and Impact

AIFS primarily serves grassroots sports organizations working in marginalized communities, with particular focus on initiatives that advance gender equity, community empowerment, and inclusive access to sports. The organization's impact model has evolved from direct funding (through NFT sales) to enabling coordination and knowledge sharing among diverse stakeholders in the sports for development ecosystem.

Secondary beneficiaries include Web3 facilitators seeking meaningful social impact applications for blockchain technologies and progressive funders looking for more equitable and transparent grantmaking mechanisms. The challenge lies in creating value for these diverse constituencies without privileging one group's needs over another's.

## 2. Organizational Structure and Governance

### Formal Structure and Governance

AIFS operates through a community governance system where participants who opt into the organization can vote on proposals affecting governance. The system uses a one-person, one-vote model, reflecting commitment to democratic participation rather than wealth-based influence common in many DAOs. This governance structure initially focused on cultural norms, community rules, and collective agreements.

Decision-making follows a deliberative proposal process involving community discussions in working groups and group chat, followed by formal proposals posted to a governance forum. This process ensures transparency and provides multiple opportunities for input, though participation rates have been affected by the organization's small size. The governance framework, based on SuperBenefit's DAO Primitives Framework, provides flexibility for evolution while maintaining clear processes.

### Informal Influence and Communication

Beyond formal structures, AIFS operates through strong relational networks and collaborative sense-making. The small contributor base enables intimate working relationships but also creates vulnerability when key contributors' availability fluctuates. Informal influence flows through demonstrated commitment and expertise rather than formal titles or token holdings.

Communication primarily occurs through Discord for day-to-day coordination, with formal governance discussions on dedicated forums. The challenge of bridging Web3-native communication tools with the preferences of traditional sports organizations remains ongoing. Trust and relationships often matter more than formal processes in actual decision-making, reflecting the organization's community-oriented values.

### Organizational Culture and Change Orientation

AIFS demonstrates exceptional openness to organizational evolution, with governance transformation being an ongoing conversation rather than a discrete event. The culture values experimentation, learning from failure, and collaborative intelligence over rigid adherence to initial plans. This adaptability proved essential as the organization navigated from its NFT origins to exploring the coordi-nation modelâ€”a shift that required fundamental rethinking of organizational purpose and structure.

Contributors share commitment to avoiding the reproduction of harmful patterns from traditional philanthropy, including colonial approaches, extractive relationships, and top-down decision-making. This commitment sometimes creates productive tension with the need for clear direction and efficient operations, requiring constant balance between autonomy and coordination.

## 3. Current System Mapping

### Core Organizational Processes

**Community Engagement and Relationship Building** The process of identifying, connecting with, and supporting grassroots sports organizations forms AIFS's operational core. Currently, this relies heavily on individual relationships and informal networks. Contributors identify potential partners through personal connections, engage in exploratory conversations to understand needs, and attempt to connect organizations with relevant resources or collaborators. Pain points include the labor-intensive nature of relationship building, difficulty communicating AIFS's value during organizational transition, and lack of systematic approach to tracking and nurturing relationships.

**Resource Mobilization and Allocation** Unlike the original NFT model's straightforward revenue generation and distribution, current resource mobilization involves complex negotiations with multiple funding sources. The organization must navigate between Web3 funding mechanisms (grants from blockchain foundations, community donations) and traditional funding sources increasingly interested in innovation. The lack of clear revenue model creates sustainability challenges and limits ability to compensate contributors or guarantee support to partner communities.

**Knowledge Sharing and Capacity Building** AIFS increasingly focuses on facilitating knowledge exchange between Web3 innovators and sports organizations. This involves organizing gatherings, creating educational resources, and providing informal consultation to organizations exploring blockchain applications. The process remains largely ad hoc, depending on contributor availability and expertise. Success relies on individual contributors' ability to translate between technical and community contexts.

### Resource and Information Architecture

Financial resources flow through a Safe multisignature wallet on Optimism blockchain, providing transparency and collective control but creating barriers for organizations unfamiliar with cryptocurrency. Information architecture remains fragmented across Discord channels, governance forums, and individual contributor knowledge, creating challenges for organizational memory and onboarding new participants.

The organization lacks systematic approaches to capturing and sharing learning from its various initiatives. While blockchain infrastructure provides transparent record of financial transactions, the equally important relational and knowledge transactions remain largely undocumented. This gap limits AIFS's ability to demonstrate impact and share learning with the broader ecosystem.

## 4. Challenge Analysis and Systemic Issues

### Primary Systemic Challenges

**Challenge 1: Unclear Value Proposition and Identity** The organization struggles to articulate its value in ways that resonate with diverse stakeholders. For Web3 audiences, the shift from NFT project to coordination platform seems like abandoning innovation for process. For sports organizations, the technical complexity and abstract nature of decentralized coordination creates barriers to understanding potential benefits. This communication challenge manifests in difficult conversations with funders, challenges creating compelling website messaging, and inconsistent social media presence.

Root causes include the emergent nature of AIFS's purpose discovery process, the lack of established precedents for organizations bridging Web3 and grassroots sports, and the inherent complexity of explaining coordination value versus direct service provision. The organization's commitment to avoiding extractive relationships sometimes prevents clear articulation of what it offers, as traditional value propositions often embed problematic power dynamics.

Current responses involve continuous experimentation with messaging, emphasis on storytelling over technical explanation, and gradual development of concrete examples through pilot initiatives. However, these responses remain insufficient for establishing clear market position or attracting sustainable funding.

**Challenge 2: Sustainable Coordination Model** Operating entirely on volunteer effort limits AIFS's ability to maintain consistent engagement, develop systematic approaches, or guarantee reliability to partner communities. The original vision included creating systems for recognizing and rewarding contributions, but insufficient scale and resources prevented implementation. This creates a vicious cycle where lack of resources prevents activities that might generate resources.

The challenge stems from fundamental tensions in the Web3 ecosystem between ideals of permissionless participation and realities of sustainable operations. Traditional nonprofit funding models conflict with DAO principles, while Web3 funding mechanisms often prioritize technical innovation over social coordination. The organization's commitment to modeling non-extractive relationships extends to its own contributors, creating ethical tensions around unpaid labor.

Current approaches include seeking grant funding for specific projects (like the gathering series) while exploring how operational cells might generate revenue to share with the broader organization. However, these remain stopgap measures rather than systematic solutions to the coordination sustainability challenge.

**Challenge 3: Bridging Technical and Community Knowledge Gaps** Serving both Web3 developers excited about technical possibilities and grassroots sports organizations focused on immediate community needs creates constant tension. Technical discussions exclude community partners, while community-focused content may seem basic to Web3 participants. This challenge extends beyond communication to fundamental questions about whose needs take priority and how to create genuinely inclusive spaces.

Root causes include vastly different baseline knowledge, divergent motivations for participation, and limited models for successful bridging between these communities. The rapid pace of Web3 innovation contrasts with the patient relationship-building required for community work. Cultural differences between "move fast and break things" tech culture and community-centered approaches create additional friction.

Current responses involve attempting to create separate spaces for different audience needs while maintaining connection points. However, this approach risks recreating silos rather than building bridges, and requires more coordination capacity than currently available.

### Cross-Challenge System Dynamics

These challenges reinforce each other through several dynamics. Unclear value proposition limits ability to attract resources needed for sustainable coordination. Lack of sustainable coordination prevents consistent engagement needed to bridge knowledge gaps. Knowledge gaps make it harder to articulate value to diverse audiences. Breaking this cycle requires addressing multiple challenges simultaneously rather than seeking silver bullet solutions.

Power dynamics underlie all challenges, as AIFS attempts to create equitable relationships while operating within systems designed for extraction and accumulation. The organization's small size and resource constraints limit ability to model alternatives at scale, while commitment to principles sometimes prevents pragmatic compromises that might enable growth.

## 6. Areas of Interest and Discovery

### Primary Interest Areas

**Interest Area 1: Coordination at Scale through Coordi-nations** Stakeholders consistently express curiosity about how decentralized technologies might enable coordination among distributed sports initiatives without creating new bureaucracies. The coordi-nations modelâ€”networking aligned communities around shared purpose and resourcesâ€”offers a compelling framework. Questions focus on practical mechanisms for connecting projects, sharing resources, and collective decision-making across cultural and geographic boundaries. Potential benefits include reduced duplication of effort, increased collective impact, and more efficient resource distribution.

Enthusiasm runs high among organizations frustrated with competitive funding dynamics and siloed operations. Web3 participants see opportunities to demonstrate practical applications of coordination technologies. However, concerns include technical complexity, time requirements for participation, and risk of creating exclusive networks that replicate existing power dynamics. This interest area directly addresses challenges of isolation and resource scarcity identified across stakeholder groups.

**Interest Area 2: Community Governance Models** Strong interest emerges around how communities can maintain ownership over their sports initiatives while accessing external resources and expertise. Stakeholders ask how blockchain governance might enable consistent reporting while unlocking additional resources and peer support. The vision includes communities setting their own priorities, managing resources transparently, and building accountability to participants rather than distant funders.

Organizations currently struggling with founder dependency or board dysfunction see particular promise. Technical partners recognize opportunities to develop governance processes suited to community contexts rather than financial protocols. Concerns center on digital literacy requirements, cultural appropriateness of proposed models, and time investment needed for meaningful participation. This connects directly to frustrations with traditional nonprofit governance and funder-driven priorities.

**Interest Area 3: Reimagined Capital Flows** Perhaps the strongest interest focuses on how Web3 technologies might enable more equitable and community-directed funding mechanisms. Questions explore participatory grantmaking, community currencies, and how to value non-financial contributions. Stakeholders envision funding flows that respond to community-identified needs rather than funder priorities, with transparent allocation processes and reduced administrative burden.

Both funders seeking transformation and communities seeking resources demonstrate readiness to experiment. Potential benefits include increased community agency, reduced power imbalances, and more sustainable resource flows. However, regulatory concerns, technical barriers, and risk of financializing community relationships require careful consideration. This interest responds directly to widespread frustration with traditional philanthropic models.

### Organic Development and Patterns

These interests emerged through iterative stakeholder conversations rather than top-down analysis. Initial discussions of technical possibilities evolved into deeper exploration of systemic change needs. Pattern recognition across different contexts revealed common challenges around power, resources, and agency that transcend specific organizational contexts. The consistency of themes across diverse stakeholders suggests genuine need rather than imposed solutions.

## 7. Readiness and Capacity Assessment

### Change and Innovation Readiness

AIFS's history demonstrates exceptional willingness to fundamental transformation, having already navigated from NFT project to coordination focus. This experience provides both confidence in ability to change and realistic understanding of associated challenges. Contributors who remained through this transition demonstrate high tolerance for ambiguity and commitment to mission over method.

The deliberative governance process that enabled previous changes remains in place, providing structured yet flexible framework for continued evolution. Small size enables rapid decision-making while commitment to collective intelligence ensures multiple perspectives inform changes. However, resource constraints limit ability to pursue multiple experiments simultaneously or recover from unsuccessful attempts.

### Technical and Infrastructure Capacity

Current technical capacity varies significantly across the organization. Core contributors include blockchain facilitators and governance system designers with sophisticated understanding of Web3 possibilities and limitations. However, connecting this expertise to grassroots partners requires constant translation and education. Existing infrastructure includes established DAO governance tools, multisignature wallet for resource management, and basic communication platforms.

Gaps exist in user-friendly interfaces for non-technical participants, systematic knowledge management systems, and tools for bridging Web3 and traditional organizational contexts. The organization lacks dedicated technical support for partners exploring implementation, limiting ability to provide hands-on assistance. Building this capacity requires resources currently unavailable through volunteer effort alone.

### Stakeholder Alignment and Communication

Strong alignment exists among core contributors around mission and values, though specific strategies remain emergent. Wider stakeholder alignment varies, with Web3 partners generally supporting experimentation while grassroots organizations seek concrete benefits. Funders demonstrate increasing openness to innovation but require evidence and accountability mechanisms.

Communication preferences diverge significantly across stakeholder groups. Web3 natives comfort with Discord and governance forums contrasts with grassroots organizations' preference for direct communication and traditional documentation. Bridging these preferences requires multiple communication channels and constant translation, stretching limited coordination capacity.

### Timing and Context Considerations

Current timing presents both opportunities and challenges. Growing mainstream interest in Web3 applications for social good creates openness to AIFS's work. Traditional philanthropy's acknowledged failures increase appetite for alternatives. However, crypto market volatility and high-profile failures create skepticism about Web3 solutions. Grassroots organizations face immediate needs that may not align with experimental timelines.

The post-pandemic context heightens both need for innovative approaches and resource constraints limiting experimentation capacity. Competition for limited Web3 social impact funding intensifies while traditional funders remain cautious about blockchain initiatives. AIFS must navigate narrow window between premature scaling and missing opportunity momentum.

## 8. Future Exploration Pathways and Recommendations

### Priority Areas for Continued Exploration

**Priority 1: Coordi-nation Infrastructure Development** Given consistent stakeholder interest and alignment with emergent organizational identity as a coordi-nation, developing concrete coordination mechanisms should take priority. The coordi-nation modelâ€”networking aligned communities around shared purpose and resourcesâ€”provides the philosophical framework for this development. This involves creating accessible tools and processes for connecting projects, facilitating resource sharing, and enabling collective decision-making. Rather than building complex technical systems, initial focus should be on lightweight processes that demonstrate value while building participant capacity.

Recommended next steps include mapping existing coordination needs across partner organizations, designing minimal viable coordination processes, and testing these through specific use cases like collective funding applications or shared learning initiatives. Resources required include dedicated coordinator time, basic technical infrastructure, and budget for relationship building. Success indicators include number of organizations actively participating, resources shared between projects, and participant-reported value from coordination.

**Priority 2: Governance Innovation Lab** The strong interest in community governance combined with AIFS's expertise in DAO governance creates opportunity for systematic experimentation. An innovation lab approach would work with select partner organizations to co-design governance models suited to their specific contexts while extracting transferable patterns. This positions AIFS as facilitator rather than solution provider, respecting community autonomy while building collective knowledge.

Next steps involve identifying partner organizations ready for governance transformation, establishing learning framework for capturing insights, and creating resource pool for implementation support. Required resources include facilitation expertise, documentation systems, and modest implementation grants for partners. Success would be measured through governance models implemented, community participation rates, and documented patterns applicable elsewhere.

### Recommended Exploration Approaches

**Learning and Development Pathway** Initial focus should be on building shared understanding across stakeholder groups through facilitated learning experiences. This includes Gatheringsâ€”structured yet emergent spaces for co-learningâ€”to explore specific topics, skill-building workshops on relevant tools, and peer learning exchanges between organizations at similar stages. The Gatherings pattern creates conditions for authentic relationship building while addressing knowledge gaps. The approach suggests an initial phase focused on relationship building and knowledge development, followed by an application phase supporting initial implementations.

Expected outcomes include common vocabulary across technical and community stakeholders, increased confidence in exploring Web3 applications, and strong relational foundation for future collaboration. This pathway minimizes risk while building essential capacity for more ambitious interventions.

**Small-Scale Experimentation Pathway** Parallel to learning activities, supporting small experiments helps generate concrete examples and build evidence base. Experiments might include testing quadratic funding for local sports initiative, implementing transparent resource allocation in existing program, or creating community currency for volunteer recognition. Each experiment should have clear learning questions, modest resource requirements, and potential for scaling if successful.

Risk management involves starting with willing early adopters, maintaining non-blockchain alternatives, and ensuring community benefit regardless of technical outcomes. Success creates demonstration effects encouraging broader adoption while failures provide valuable learning at minimal cost.

### Implementation Success Factors

Organizational strengths to leverage include deep commitment to mission, established governance framework enabling evolution, and position at intersection of key networks. The small, dedicated team enables rapid response while commitment to collaborative intelligence ensures multiple perspectives inform decisions. Existing relationships across Web3 and sports sectors provide foundation for expanded engagement.

Critical success factors include securing minimum sustainable funding for coordination functions, maintaining balance between technical innovation and community needs, and developing clear communication strategies for diverse audiences. The organization must resist pressure to choose between Web3 and grassroots orientations, instead maintaining creative tension that enables bridging. Regular reflection and adaptation cycles ensure continued alignment between activities and emergent purpose.

### Next Phase Preparation

Information gaps requiring resolution include specific technical requirements for coordination infrastructure, regulatory considerations for innovative funding mechanisms, and detailed understanding of partner organizations' governance pain points. Additional stakeholder engagement should focus on potential funding partners to understand their transformation readiness and support requirements.

The Discovery insights provide clear direction for intervention mapping around coordination infrastructure and governance innovation. Key decisions involve balancing breadth versus depth of engagement, choosing technical platforms that enable rather than constrain participation, and establishing sustainable resource models that align with organizational values. These discoveries position AIFS to design interventions that address identified challenges while building on stakeholder interests and organizational capabilities.
