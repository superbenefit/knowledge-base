_Strategic mapping of intervention possibilities connecting Discovery insights to decentralized coordination patterns_

**Date**: 2025 (Retrospective)  
**Prepared by**: All In For Sport governance team and SuperBenefit facilitators  
**Based on Discovery Report**: All In For Sport Discovery Report - 2025

## Executive Summary

All In For Sport designed a two-pronged intervention approach to address the core challenges identified through stakeholder engagement and organizational reflection. The intervention combines Gatherings—a participatory series to bridge Web3 facilitators with grassroots sports organizations—and a fundamental governance transformation implementing a coordi-nations model. This coordi-nations approach shifts from product-led to coordination-focused structure, networking aligned communities around shared purpose and resources. The intervention directly addresses the unclear value proposition by demonstrating AIFS's role as a coordination layer, tackles sustainability through new resource-sharing mechanisms, and bridges knowledge gaps through iterative, inclusive learning experiences.

The gathering series, funded independently through Jumpstart, implements the Gatherings pattern—creating structured yet emergent spaces for co-learning and relationship building across diverse stakeholders. Simultaneously, the governance transformation, supported by the Reimagining Power Project, implements the coordi-nations model, formalizing a two-house structure that separates community governance from operational cells. This structure enables autonomous teams to pursue projects while maintaining accountability to the broader community's mission and values. Resources were allocated across both interventions, with support for gathering facilitation, speaker fees, and participant engagement.

The intervention design reflects AIFS's commitment to emergent learning and avoiding imposed solutions. Rather than prescribing specific outcomes, the approach creates conditions for stakeholders to identify shared challenges and co-create responses. Success metrics focus on participation quality, relationship development, and organizational clarity rather than traditional quantitative targets. The implementation timeline allows for patient relationship building while maintaining momentum through visible activities.

## Strategic Context

### Discovery Connections

**Key Systemic Issues Being Addressed**:

The intervention targeted three interconnected challenges. First, the unclear value proposition would be addressed by demonstrating rather than explaining AIFS's role as a coordination layer through practical gathering experiences and governance modeling that shows how decentralized coordination works in practice. Second, the unsustainable volunteer model would be transformed through governance changes creating mechanisms for operational cells to generate and share resources, while the gatherings piloted compensating contributors for specific deliverables. Third, the technical-community knowledge gap would be bridged through gathering formats specifically designed to create value for both Web3 facilitators and grassroots organizations, while governance changes enabled specialized teams to work within their expertise areas without forcing false integration.

### Organizational Readiness

**Strengths to Build On**: The intervention leveraged several organizational strengths. The established DAO Primitives Framework enabled governance evolution without starting from scratch, providing tested structures for change. Strong relationships across Web3 and sports sectors created a foundation for convening diverse stakeholders. The core team's demonstrated resilience through previous organizational transformation showed capacity for navigating complexity. Existing technical infrastructure including governance tools and multisig wallets reduced implementation barriers.

**Gaps to Address**: Several gaps required attention during implementation. The lack of experience compensating contributors necessitated developing new processes and learning fair allocation approaches. Limited documentation systems meant investing in knowledge capture capabilities. Communication channel fragmentation across Discord, forums, and other platforms required intentional integration strategies. The absence of a clear revenue model demanded experimentation with various sustainability mechanisms throughout the intervention.

### Environmental Considerations

**External Factors Supporting Change**: The broader environment created favorable conditions for the intervention. Growing funder interest in innovative grantmaking approaches opened potential resource partnerships. Mainstream recognition of traditional philanthropy's limitations created space for alternatives like the coordi-nations model. The expanding Web3 social impact ecosystem provided peer learning and collaboration opportunities. Post-pandemic acceptance of virtual collaboration reduced geographic barriers to participation.

**External Challenges to Navigate**: Several external challenges required careful navigation. Crypto market volatility affected stakeholder confidence and resource availability, requiring emphasis on the coordination value beyond financial speculation. Regulatory uncertainty around DAO operations and cryptocurrency transactions necessitated careful structuring. Limited digital literacy among grassroots partners demanded patient capacity building and alternative participation methods. Competition for scarce Web3 social impact funding required clear differentiation of AIFS's unique coordi-nations approach.

## Intervention Areas

### Intervention Area 1: Knowledge Mobilization through Gatherings

**Systemic Issue Addressed**: Technical-community knowledge gaps preventing meaningful collaboration between Web3 facilitators and grassroots sports organizations

**Current State**: Web3 facilitators often work on solutions without deep understanding of community contexts and needs. Grassroots organizations remain skeptical of blockchain technologies, seeing them as complex distractions from immediate challenges. No consistent spaces exist for these groups to engage in mutual learning and relationship building. Information asymmetries perpetuate power imbalances and limit innovation potential.

**Transformation Vision**: The Gatherings pattern creates an ongoing community of practice where diverse stakeholders co-learn and co-create. Unlike traditional presentations or workshops, Gatherings emphasize emergence, relationship-building, and collective intelligence. Sessions balance technical education with community wisdom sharing, ensuring all participants both teach and learn. Relationships formed through Gatherings catalyze collaborative projects that neither group could achieve alone. The pattern emphasizes documentation and knowledge sharing to contribute to ecosystem learning.

**Power Dynamics**:

- **Current**: Technical knowledge holders dominate blockchain conversations while community organizations defer or disengage
- **Proposed**: Rotating facilitation and expertise recognition ensures balanced voice and validates multiple forms of knowledge
- **Implications**: Community organizations gain confidence to engage with technology on their terms while developers gain humility and context

**Pattern Connections**:

- **Primary Pattern**: Gatherings
    - How it addresses the issue: Creates ongoing space for diverse stakeholders to build relationships and co-create knowledge
    - Implementation considerations: Requires skilled facilitation and comfort with emergent outcomes
- **Supporting Pattern**: Participatory Design
    - Role in intervention: Ensures gathering content emerges from participant needs rather than predetermined curriculum

### Intervention Area 2: Governance Transformation to Coordi-nations Model (AIFSIP-04)

**Systemic Issue Addressed**: Unclear value proposition and unsustainable coordination model limiting organizational effectiveness

**Current State**: Single governance system attempts to serve both community norm-setting and operational decision-making, creating inefficiencies. Lack of clear operational structure makes it difficult to pursue opportunities or communicate organizational offerings. Volunteer-only model limits capacity and reliability. No mechanisms exist for resource generation or sharing between initiatives.

**Transformation Vision**: Implementation of the coordi-nations model creates a network of aligned communities around shared purpose and resources. The two-house governance structure separates community stewardship of mission/values from operational execution. Autonomous cells pursue aligned projects with clear mandates and resource control, functioning as distinct communities within the broader coordi-nation. Resource sharing between cells and operational DAO creates sustainable funding for coordination. This networked structure enables effective communication about AIFS's role as a coordi-nation facilitating connections between aligned communities.

**Power Dynamics**:

- **Current**: Informal influence based on availability and relationships creates unpredictability
- **Proposed**: Formal separation of powers with clear domains of authority for different governance bodies
- **Implications**: Operational teams gain autonomy while remaining accountable to community values

**Pattern Connections**:

- **Primary Pattern**: Coordi-nations
    - How it addresses the issue: Creates organizational structure for networking aligned communities around shared purpose and resources
    - Implementation considerations: Requires clear definition of community boundaries and shared governance mechanisms
- **Supporting Pattern**: Cell Structure
    - Role in intervention: Enables autonomous teams to operate within the coordi-nation framework while maintaining alignment

## Implementation Pathways

### Pathway 1: Iterative Co-Creation Approach

**Overview**: This pathway emphasizes learning-by-doing through rapid cycles of experimentation, reflection, and adaptation. It implements two primary patterns—Gatherings for knowledge mobilization and coordi-nations for governance transformation—through emergent, participatory processes. Rather than extensive upfront planning, the approach starts with minimal viable implementations of these patterns and builds based on stakeholder feedback and insights.

**Key Phases**:

The implementation would begin with foundation setting, launching the gathering series with Session 0's co-design process while initiating governance transformation discussions with the community. This phase established systems for learning capture and built the core facilitation and coordination team necessary for success.

Active experimentation would follow, running regular gatherings with iterative improvements based on participant feedback. Simultaneously, governance proposals would be drafted and refined through community input, testing resource sharing mechanisms with initial cells, and documenting patterns and insights for broader ecosystem sharing.

The final phase focused on integration and evolution - synthesizing learnings into shareable resources, implementing the formal governance changes through AIFSIP-04, establishing sustainable operations for successful initiatives, and planning next phases based on validated learnings. This iterative approach allowed for continuous adaptation while maintaining momentum toward transformation.

**Resource Requirements**:

The intervention required human resources across multiple functions: gathering facilitation and coordination throughout the project, governance design and facilitation support, marketing and communications management, and technical support as needed. Technical infrastructure included video conferencing platforms with recording capabilities, collaborative tools like Figma and shared documents, DAO governance platforms including Snapshot and forums, communication infrastructure through Discord and email, and basic project management tools.

Financial resources were secured through two primary sources - Jumpstart funding for the gathering series and Reimagining Power Project funding for governance transformation. These resources supported facilitation, speaker fees, software costs, and marketing efforts necessary to ensure meaningful participation and impact.

## Pattern Integration Strategy

### Selected Patterns and Rationale

The intervention integrated four key patterns to achieve transformation. The coordi-nations pattern provided the overarching framework for networking aligned communities around shared purpose and resources, requiring careful definition of community boundaries and shared governance mechanisms. The Gatherings pattern created structured yet emergent spaces for co-learning and relationship building, demanding skilled facilitation to balance technical and grassroots needs. Cell structure enabled autonomous teams to operate within the coordi-nation framework while maintaining clear accountability to the community. Resource sharing mechanisms ensured coordi-nation sustainability through fair contribution approaches that respected cell autonomy.

### Integration Approach

**Sequencing**: Begin with Gatherings to build relationships and identify aligned communities. Use insights from Gatherings to inform coordi-nation structure. Implement cell structure as specific communities join the coordi-nation. Develop resource sharing as cells begin generating value.

**Dependencies**: Gatherings create the relational foundation for coordi-nations. Coordi-nation philosophy guides cell structure implementation. Resource sharing emerges from successful coordination between cells.

**Technical Integration**: Governance tools support transparent coordination. Gathering platforms enable distributed participation. Financial infrastructure facilitates resource sharing within the coordi-nation.

**Social Integration**: Gatherings build trust necessary for coordi-nation governance. Coordi-nation principles ensure cells maintain alignment while preserving autonomy. Resource sharing reinforces mutual support within the network.

## Success Framework

### Success Criteria

Success would be measured through both quantitative metrics and qualitative indicators. The intervention would track gathering participation to ensure diverse stakeholder engagement, monitor the emergence of autonomous cells as evidence of the coordi-nations model taking hold, document resource flows between cells to validate sustainability mechanisms, and count knowledge products generated to assess ecosystem contribution.

Qualitative assessment would focus on stakeholder-reported value from gatherings through feedback forms and interviews, clarity of organizational identity measured through consistent messaging and partner understanding, relationship quality between diverse stakeholders observed through continued engagement and collaboration, and contributor satisfaction with governance evaluated through participation rates and feedback.

### Monitoring and Evaluation

The monitoring approach emphasized regular touchpoints without creating burdensome reporting. Regular team coordination meetings would track activities and surface emerging patterns. Periodic stakeholder feedback collection would identify what was working and what needed adjustment. Comprehensive progress reviews against success criteria would ensure the intervention remained on track, with a full evaluation at project completion incorporating external perspectives.

Data collection methods balanced quantitative tracking with rich qualitative insights. Gathering feedback forms would capture participant experiences and perceived value. Governance participation tracking would monitor engagement levels across the community. Financial flow documentation would track resource generation and sharing between cells. Story harvesting would collect qualitative impacts and unexpected outcomes that numbers alone couldn't capture.

Learning and adaptation were built into the implementation design. Regular team retrospectives would inform immediate adjustments. Periodic reviews could trigger larger strategy adaptations based on emerging insights. Knowledge sharing with the broader ecosystem would happen through regular reports, ensuring learnings benefited beyond just AIFS.

## Next Steps

The intervention design established clear pathways forward. Immediate priorities included finalizing the Gatherings design through stakeholder input, drafting the AIFSIP-04 governance proposal for community discussion, and launching outreach to ensure strong participation.

Key decision points would emerge around governance proposal ratification through the community's one-person, one-vote process and evaluation of the Gatherings series success to inform continuation. These decisions would be made through AIFS's deliberative processes, ensuring all voices were heard before moving forward.

Communication would flow through established channels - Discord and video calls for the core team, regular updates for contributors, and personalized outreach to partner organizations. The intervention emphasized maintaining strong relationships while building new connections across the Web3 and grassroots sports ecosystems.
