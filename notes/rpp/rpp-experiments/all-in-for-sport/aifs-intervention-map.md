# All In For Sport Intervention Mapping

*Strategic mapping of intervention possibilities connecting Discovery insights to decentralized coordination patterns*

**Date**: July 2025 (Retrospective)  
**Prepared by**: All In For Sport governance team and SuperBenefit facilitators  
**Based on Discovery Report**: All In For Sport Discovery Report - July 2025

## Executive Summary

All In For Sport designed a two-pronged intervention approach to address the core challenges identified through stakeholder engagement and organizational reflection. The intervention combines a participatory gathering series to bridge Web3 innovators with grassroots sports organizations and a fundamental governance transformation shifting from product-led to coordination-focused structure. This approach directly addresses the unclear value proposition by demonstrating AIFS's role as a coordination layer, tackles sustainability through new resource-sharing mechanisms, and bridges knowledge gaps through iterative, inclusive learning experiences.

The gathering series, funded independently through Jumpstart, would run for six months with six interactive sessions co-designed with participants. Simultaneously, the governance transformation, supported by the Reimagining Power Project, would formalize a two-house model separating community governance from operational cells. This structure enables autonomous teams to pursue projects while maintaining accountability to the broader community's mission and values. Resources totaling approximately $50,000 were allocated across both interventions, with the majority supporting gathering facilitation and documentation.

The intervention design reflects AIFS's commitment to emergent learning and avoiding imposed solutions. Rather than prescribing specific outcomes, the approach creates conditions for stakeholders to identify shared challenges and co-create responses. Success metrics focus on participation quality, relationship development, and organizational clarity rather than traditional quantitative targets. The 16-month implementation timeline allows for patient relationship building while maintaining momentum through visible activities.

## Strategic Context

### Discovery Connections

**Key Systemic Issues Being Addressed**:

1. **Unclear Value Proposition**: The intervention demonstrates rather than explains AIFS's value as a coordination layer through practical gathering experiences and governance modeling that shows how decentralized coordination can work in practice.

2. **Unsustainable Volunteer Model**: The governance transformation creates mechanisms for operational cells to generate and share resources, while the gatherings pilot compensating contributors for specific deliverables, testing sustainable coordination approaches.

3. **Technical-Community Knowledge Gap**: The gathering series specifically designs inclusive formats that create value for both Web3 innovators and grassroots organizations, while governance changes enable specialized teams to work within their expertise areas without forcing false integration.

### Organizational Readiness

**Strengths to Build On**:
- Established DAO Primitives Framework enabling governance evolution without starting from scratch
- Strong relationships across Web3 and sports sectors providing foundation for convening
- Core team's demonstrated resilience and commitment through previous organizational transformation
- Existing technical infrastructure (governance tools, multisig wallet) reducing implementation barriers

**Gaps to Address**:
- Lack of experience compensating contributors requiring new processes and learning
- Limited documentation systems necessitating investment in knowledge capture
- Communication channel fragmentation requiring intentional integration strategies
- Absence of clear revenue model demanding experimentation with sustainability mechanisms

### Environmental Considerations

**External Factors Supporting Change**:
- Growing funder interest in innovative grantmaking approaches creating potential resource partners
- Mainstream recognition of traditional philanthropy's limitations opening space for alternatives
- Expanding Web3 social impact ecosystem providing peer learning and collaboration opportunities
- Post-pandemic acceptance of virtual collaboration reducing geographic barriers

**External Challenges to Navigate**:
- Crypto market volatility affecting stakeholder confidence and resource availability
- Regulatory uncertainty around DAO operations and cryptocurrency transactions
- Limited digital literacy among grassroots partners requiring patient capacity building
- Competition for scarce Web3 social impact funding necessitating clear differentiation

## Intervention Areas

### Intervention Area 1: Knowledge Mobilization Gathering Series

**Systemic Issue Addressed**: Technical-community knowledge gaps preventing meaningful collaboration between Web3 innovators and grassroots sports organizations

**Current State**:
Web3 developers create solutions without deep understanding of community contexts and needs. Grassroots organizations remain skeptical of blockchain technologies, seeing them as complex distractions from immediate challenges. No consistent spaces exist for these groups to engage in mutual learning and relationship building. Information asymmetries perpetuate power imbalances and limit innovation potential.

**Transformation Vision**:
Interactive gatherings create ongoing community of practice where diverse stakeholders co-learn and co-create. Sessions balance technical education with community wisdom sharing, ensuring all participants both teach and learn. Relationships formed through gatherings catalyze collaborative projects that neither group could achieve alone. Documentation captures and shares insights broadly, contributing to ecosystem knowledge.

**Power Dynamics**:
- **Current**: Technical knowledge holders dominate blockchain conversations while community organizations defer or disengage
- **Proposed**: Rotating facilitation and expertise recognition ensures balanced voice and validates multiple forms of knowledge
- **Implications**: Community organizations gain confidence to engage with technology on their terms while developers gain humility and context

**Pattern Connections**:
- **Primary Pattern**: Participatory Design Sessions
  - How it addresses the issue: Ensures gathering content emerges from participant needs rather than predetermined curriculum
  - Implementation considerations: Requires skilled facilitation and comfort with emergent outcomes
- **Supporting Pattern**: Multi-stakeholder Governance
  - Role in intervention: Gathering participants influence future session design and overall direction

### Intervention Area 2: Governance Transformation (AIFSIP-04)

**Systemic Issue Addressed**: Unclear value proposition and unsustainable coordination model limiting organizational effectiveness

**Current State**:
Single governance system attempts to serve both community norm-setting and operational decision-making, creating inefficiencies. Lack of clear operational structure makes it difficult to pursue opportunities or communicate organizational offerings. Volunteer-only model limits capacity and reliability. No mechanisms exist for resource generation or sharing between initiatives.

**Transformation Vision**:
Two-house governance model separates community stewardship of mission/values from operational execution. Autonomous cells pursue aligned projects with clear mandates and resource control. Resource sharing between cells and operational DAO creates sustainable funding for coordination. Clear structure enables effective communication about AIFS's offerings and value.

**Power Dynamics**:
- **Current**: Informal influence based on availability and relationships creates unpredictability
- **Proposed**: Formal separation of powers with clear domains of authority for different governance bodies
- **Implications**: Operational teams gain autonomy while remaining accountable to community values

**Pattern Connections**:
- **Primary Pattern**: Cell Structure
  - How it addresses the issue: Enables autonomous teams to move quickly while maintaining alignment
  - Implementation considerations: Requires clear boundaries and accountability mechanisms
- **Supporting Pattern**: Resource Sharing Agreements
  - Role in intervention: Creates sustainable funding flows between revenue-generating cells and coordination functions

### Intervention Area 3: Strategic Communication Framework

**Systemic Issue Addressed**: Inability to articulate value to diverse stakeholders limiting partnership and funding opportunities

**Current State**:
Messaging varies inconsistently across platforms and contributors. Technical jargon alienates community partners while simplified messages fail to engage Web3 audiences. Lack of concrete examples makes value proposition abstract. Story of transformation from NFT project to coordination platform remains unclear to external audiences.

**Transformation Vision**:
Clear narrative framework enables consistent communication while allowing adaptation for different audiences. Concrete examples from gatherings and governance transformation demonstrate rather than explain value. Multiple contributors can articulate organizational identity and offerings coherently. Strategic positioning attracts aligned partners and resources.

**Power Dynamics**:
- **Current**: Those with strongest communication skills disproportionately shape organizational narrative
- **Proposed**: Collaborative storytelling processes ensure multiple voices shape organizational identity
- **Implications**: Diverse perspectives enrich organizational narrative while maintaining coherence

**Pattern Connections**:
- **Primary Pattern**: Collective Sensemaking
  - How it addresses the issue: Regular reflection processes help organization understand and articulate its evolving identity
  - Implementation considerations: Requires dedicated time and skilled facilitation
- **Supporting Pattern**: Documentation Practices
  - Role in intervention: Systematic capture of activities and outcomes provides evidence for value claims

## Implementation Pathways

### Pathway 1: Iterative Co-Creation Approach

**Overview**: This pathway emphasizes learning-by-doing through rapid cycles of experimentation, reflection, and adaptation. Rather than extensive upfront planning, the approach starts with minimal viable interventions and builds based on stakeholder feedback and emergent insights.

**Key Phases**:

1. **Phase 1 - Foundation Setting** (Months 1-3): 
   - Launch gathering series with Session 0 co-design process
   - Initiate governance transformation discussions with community
   - Establish documentation and learning capture systems
   - Build core facilitation and coordination team

2. **Phase 2 - Active Experimentation** (Months 4-9):
   - Run monthly gatherings with iterative improvements
   - Draft and refine governance proposals through community input
   - Test resource sharing mechanisms with initial cells
   - Document patterns and insights for broader sharing

3. **Phase 3 - Integration and Evolution** (Months 10-16):
   - Synthesize learnings into shareable resources
   - Implement formal governance changes (AIFSIP-04)
   - Establish sustainable operations for successful initiatives
   - Plan next phase based on validated learnings

**Resource Requirements**:

*Human Resources*:
- Gathering Facilitator/Coordinator: 20 hours/week throughout project
- Governance Designer/Facilitator: 15 hours/week throughout project
- Documentation/Knowledge Manager: 10 hours/week throughout project
- Technical Support: 5 hours/week as needed
- Total estimated hours: 3,200 hours over 16 months

*Technical Resources*:

   - Create resource mobilization systems
   - Establish formal partnerships

2. **Phase 2 - Controlled Launch** (Months 7-12):
   - Pilot with selected partners
   - Refine based on feedback
   - Scale gradually
   - Document extensively

3. **Phase 3 - Full Implementation** (Months 13-16):
   - Open participation broadly
   - Activate all governance mechanisms
   - Launch revenue generation
   - Measure comprehensive impact

This pathway would require larger upfront investment but potentially create more stable long-term operations. AIFS chose the iterative approach as better aligned with values and available resources.
