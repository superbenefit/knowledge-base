# ICS Case Study - Step 1.1: Journey Arc Extraction

## The Journey Arc

### 1. Starting Point

**From the Discovery Report:**

The Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) began this journey as a federal not-for-profit organization based in London, Ontario, with a rich history of community-based initiatives. However, they faced significant organizational challenges:

**Governance Bottlenecks:**
> "The governance structure of ICS is currently centralized, with high-level decisions made by a core team, supported by volunteers. **While effective for program delivery, this model places significant pressure on the core team and limits volunteer agency and community ownership.**" (Discovery Report)

**Existing Programs:**
- Repair Café: "mobilizes a network of skilled volunteers who repair household items free of charge"
- Thing Library: "allows community members to borrow tools and equipment"
- Community Workshops: "cover a diverse range of topics, including furniture repair, clothing mending, and sustainable cooking"

**Key Challenges Identified:**
- Limited volunteer agency despite strong volunteer base
- Centralized decision-making creating bottlenecks
- Need to scale impact and reach
- Funding sustainability concerns
- Limited community ownership of programs

### 2. Catalyst

**From Discovery Report and Experiment Scoping:**

Multiple factors converged to catalyze this experiment:

**Primary Catalyst - RPP Opportunity:**
> "This report outlines a discovery process conducted as part of ICS's participation in the Reimagining Power Project (RPP)." (Discovery Report)

**Funding:**
- From Reflections: "Reporting deadline for OTF (Ontario Trillium Foundation) grant - $100,000 grant which was majority funding for the project"

**Vision Alignment:**
> "The goal is to prototype a governance model that not only enhances ICS's internal operations but also establishes its role as a local node in the decentralized regenerative web3 ecosystem." (Discovery Report)

**Timing Factors:**
- ICS evolved from Reimagine Co and was ready for next phase
- Growing interest in regenerative finance movement
- Opportunity to become "a local node of the global regenerative movement"

**Key Quote on Motivation:**
> "How can we scale regenerative solutions, empower communities, and catalyze a global transition to an economy where cooperation and mutualism replace extraction and exploitation?" (Discovery Report)

### 3. Key Milestones

**From all three documents, chronologically:**

**January 2025:**
- Governance infrastructure setup begins (Reflections)
- GreenPill chapter application submitted (Reflections)

**February 2025:**
- GreenPill chapter application approved (Reflections)
- Governance setup completion target (Scoping)
- ENS domain established (theics.eth) (Reflections)
- Hats Protocol roles implementation (Tree 100/119) (Reflections)

**March 2025:**
- Green Pill Network local chapter kickoff target (Scoping)
- First GreenPill meeting held (March 23) (Reflections)
- Second GreenPill meeting (March 30) (Reflections)
- Onboarding workshop target (Scoping)
- Hypercert minting target (Scoping)

**April 2025:**
- Third GreenPill meeting (April 10) (Reflections)

**May 2025:**
- Scott Morris workshop on community currencies - "organized at short notice due to Scott coming to Toronto" (Reflections)
- GreenPill Toronto event at Consensus conference (Reflections)
- ETHDenver connections - "Heenal had the opportunity to attend ETHDenver and connect with GreenPill stewards" (Reflections)

**June 2025:**
- Fourth GreenPill meeting (June 9) (Reflections)

**July 2025:**
- Reflection point and OTF reporting deadline (Reflections)

**Major Unexpected Milestones:**
- Participation in Gitcoin Grants Round 23 (GG23) - achieved top 10% ranking (Reflections)
- Earthfest booth opportunity secured (Reflections)

### 4. Evolution

**How the experiment changed from original plans:**

**From Single to Multiple Meetings:**
> "**GreenPill meetings exceeded plan**: Hosted 4+ meetings instead of the single planned inaugural meeting, showing sustained engagement" (Reflections)

**Hypercert Pivot:**
> "❌ Traditional hypercert not minted
> ✅ **Alternative approach**: Participated in Gitcoin Grants Round 23 (GG23)
> ✅ Created Karma GAP profile for on-chain impact recording" (Reflections)

**Timeline Flexibility:**
> "**Key insight**: The timeline had to respond to circumstances and team capacity rather than forcing a predetermined sequence and timing of events
> This flexible approach led to better outcomes (e.g., GG23 success, stronger network connections)" (Reflections)

**Workshop Evolution:**
- Original: Single onboarding workshop
- Evolved to: "dual format (intro + 8-week cohort)" based on community feedback that "Locals want to learn how to 'do'/participate in web3, not just learn theory" (Reflections)

**Focus Shift:**
> "**Initial assumptions**: The team originally focused on impact attestations and bringing external web3 funding into the community
> **Evolved perspective**: Real interest lies in participation and agency - people want to be involved in decisions that affect them" (Reflections)

### 5. Ending Point

**Current state from Reflections (July 2025):**

**Governance Achievement:**
> "**Active users**: 4 people actively using these systems (exceeding goal of 3+)" (Reflections)

**Infrastructure Status:**
- "ICS multisig wallet (0x3B454B53B4c414fFa8297EC49C9d5F040Cf035f8) and ENS domain (theics.eth) operational"
- "CharmVerse workspace actively used for coordination"
- "Snapshot space for voting established"
- "Integration with SuperBenefit's on-chain accounting system"

**GreenPill Success:**
> "✅ Four meetings held (March 23, March 30, April 10, June 9, 2025)
> **Attendance**: 4 people at each meeting" (Reflections)

**Major Achievement:**
> "**Major success**: Achieved top 10% ranking in GG23 funding" (Reflections)

**Foundation vs. Full Adoption:**
> "**Foundation Built**: Infrastructure and relationships established for future growth" (Reflections, Key Messages)

**Honest Assessment:**
> "**Progress**: Limited - The new infrastructure hasn't yet touched everyday decision-making. Still in experimental phase and some way from practical implementation" (Reflections)

**Team Status:**
> "**Strengthened collaboration**: The experiment has fostered connection and co-creation among the 4 members actively involved
> **Shared language**: Team now has shared vocabulary and understanding around web3 governance concepts" (Reflections)

**Looking Forward:**
> "**Current limitation**: Benefits of decentralization remain within the small experimental group
> **Outlook**: Infrastructure is in place but integration into daily operations is still 6-18 months away" (Reflections)

## Summary of Journey Arc

The ICS experiment began with a centralized nonprofit facing governance bottlenecks and limited volunteer agency, catalyzed by a $100,000 OTF grant through the Reimagining Power Project. Over six months (January-July 2025), they built Web3 governance infrastructure, launched GreenPill London with 4 regular meetings, achieved top 10% in GG23, and created a foundation for future transformation. The journey evolved from rigid plans to opportunistic flexibility, from funding focus to participation emphasis, and from single workshop to cohort model. While only 4 core members actively use the new systems (exceeding the goal of 3), they've established infrastructure and relationships that position ICS for broader adoption over the next 6-18 months.
