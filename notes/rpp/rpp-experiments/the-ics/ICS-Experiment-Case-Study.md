# Reimagining Power @ ICS

*ICS experiments with decentralized governance tools, discovering that communities seek participation in decision-making rather than just new funding mechanisms*

**An Institute for Community Sustainability Case Study in Decentralized Governance Implementation**

---

## Executive Summary

The Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) implemented Web3 governance infrastructure from January to July 2025 as part of SuperBenefit's Reimagining Power Project. The experiment successfully established operational governance systems used by four core team members, launched London's first Green Pill Network chapter, and achieved top 10% ranking in Gitcoin Grants Round 23.

Key learnings include the 6-18 month timeline required for meaningful Web3 adoption at community level, the importance of making tools enjoyable and accessible, and the value of responding to opportunities rather than forcing predetermined plans. The experiment continues with plans for public demonstrations and expanded education programs in fall 2025.

## Background and Context

### The Organization

The Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) is a federal not-for-profit organization in London, Ontario. The organization operates three main programs that embody its mission of helping Londoners lead more sustainable and connected lives:
- Repair Café: Volunteer-led repair services that divert waste from landfills
- Thing Library: Tool and equipment lending to reduce consumption
- Community Workshops: Skills training in repair, mending, and sustainability

### The Challenge

ICS faced several systemic challenges that prompted exploration of Web3 governance. These challenges threatened both operational efficiency and the organization's ability to scale its impact:

**Governance Bottlenecks**: Centralized decision-making concentrated in a small core team created delays and limited organizational responsiveness. While effective for day-to-day operations, this structure constrained growth and innovation.

**Limited Volunteer Agency**: Despite a motivated volunteer base, contributors lacked meaningful participation in organizational direction and strategic decisions.

**Funding Sustainability**: Traditional grant-based funding created uncertainty and limited ICS's ability to plan long-term initiatives.

**Scaling Constraints**: The centralized model placed unsustainable pressure on core team members while limiting the organization's ability to expand programs or reach.

### The Journey Begins

ICS's participation in SuperBenefit's Reimagining Power Project provided the opportunity to explore decentralized governance approaches. The RPP offered technical expertise, facilitation support, and connections to the Web3 ecosystem that enabled ICS to experiment with new organizational models.

These resources allowed ICS to explore whether Web3 tools could address governance challenges while connecting the organization to the global regenerative finance movement.

## Approach

### From Discovery to Strategy

Initial discovery revealed that ICS's centralized structure, while enabling program delivery, created systemic barriers to growth and community ownership. Stakeholder input emphasized desires for greater participation in decision-making and more distributed leadership. These insights shaped a strategy focused on building technical infrastructure while cultivating the social foundations for decentralized governance.

The team made strategic choices to start small with committed participants rather than attempting broad adoption immediately. This approach acknowledged both the organization's capacity constraints and the significant conceptual gap between Web3 tools and mainstream understanding.

### Patterns and Interventions

ICS implemented four interventions between January and July 2025, each designed to test different aspects of decentralized governance and community engagement:

**Selected Patterns:**
- **Governance Infrastructure**: Multisig wallet, ENS domain, Hats Protocol roles, voting systems, and collaborative spaces to enable distributed decision-making
- **On-chain Impact Documentation**: Blockchain-based recording of social and environmental contributions to enable transparency and future funding
- **Local Web3 Chapter**: Green Pill Network node to connect local regenerative initiatives with global movement
- **Progressive Onboarding**: Education approaches evolving from single workshop to sustained cohort model based on community feedback

### Resource Mobilization

The experiment employed an adaptive methodology, adjusting plans based on emerging opportunities and community feedback. Rather than following a rigid timeline, the team prioritized responding to real-world feedback and ecosystem opportunities. Resources included volunteer time (hundreds of hours), RPP facilitation support, and existing ICS relationships and infrastructure.

## Transformation Story

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Development (January-March 2025)

The initial phase focused on establishing the technical foundation for decentralized governance. This period saw rapid implementation of multiple Web3 tools and systems.

**Technical Achievements**:
- Established multisignature wallet with 4 signers
- Secured ENS domain (theics.eth)
- Configured Hats Protocol tree for role management
- Created CharmVerse and Snapshot spaces
- Integrated with SuperBenefit systems

**Key Outcomes**:
- Four core team members actively using systems (exceeding goal of 3)
- All technical infrastructure operational
- Green Pill Network application submitted and approved

**Challenges**:
- Limited interest from broader volunteer base
- Technical complexity deterred casual participation

### Phase 2: Adaptation and Discovery (March-July 2025)

This phase marked a shift from infrastructure building to active experimentation and strategic evolution based on real-world feedback and opportunities.

**Activities and Adaptations**:
- Held four Green Pill London meetings (March 23, March 30, April 10, June 9)
- Team member attended ETHDenver and Consensus Toronto conferences
- Launched Gitcoin Grants Round 23 campaign achieving top 10% ranking
- Pivoted from hypercerts to Karma GAP for ecosystem compatibility
- Redesigned education approach from single workshop to cohort model

**Key Discoveries**:
- Community members wanted practical participation, not theoretical education
- Web3 adoption timeline reality: 6-18 months, not weeks
- Conference connections accelerated ecosystem integration
- External validation (GG23) built internal confidence
- Flexibility yielded better results than rigid planning

## Outcomes and Reflections

### What Changed

The experiment produced measurable outcomes across multiple dimensions:

| Metric | Target | Achieved | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|
| Active governance users | 3+ | 4 | ✓ Exceeded |
| Infrastructure components | 5 | 7 | ✓ Exceeded |
| Hypercert/impact documentation | 1 | 1 (via Karma GAP) | ✓ Adapted |
| Green Pill meetings | 1 | 4 | ✓ Exceeded |
| Education workshop | 1 | 0 (redesigned) | ⟲ Pivoted |
| GG23 ranking | N/A | Top 10% | ✓ Bonus |

**Qualitative Changes**:
- Developed shared vocabulary for Web3 governance within core team
- Strategic shift from "acquiring resources" to "enabling participation"
- Recognition that enjoyment is essential for adoption
- Acceptance of extended transformation timelines

**Stakeholder Experiences**:
Different stakeholder groups experienced the experiment in distinct ways, reflecting varying levels of engagement and different relationships to the Web3 tools and concepts being introduced.

- **Core Team**: Deep engagement with all tools, regular participation in governance decisions, strong sense of ownership and agency
- **ICS Volunteers**: Minimal engagement with new systems, benefits not yet extended to broader base
- **Green Pill Participants**: Consistent attendance by small group, preference for practical over theoretical learning
- **External Community**: GG23 donors validated work through contributions, conference connections opened opportunities

### What We Learned

Several key principles emerged for successfully engaging communities with Web3 tools and concepts:

**Fun is Fundamental**: Complex tools require enjoyable experiences to overcome learning barriers. Community events, gamification, and social elements proved more effective than technical training.

**Participation Over Resources**: Communities showed greater interest in having voice and agency in decisions than in accessing new funding sources. This insight fundamentally reoriented the experiment's approach.

**Small Teams as Foundation**: Four committed individuals successfully established comprehensive infrastructure. While this doesn't constitute broad adoption, it creates necessary foundation for future growth.

**Flexibility Enables Opportunity**: Responding to emergent opportunities (GG23, conferences) yielded better outcomes than following rigid plans. Organizations should maintain readiness to pivot while keeping core objectives clear.

**Communication Challenges Persist**: The gap between Web3 concepts and mainstream understanding proved wider than anticipated. Despite multiple approaches, effectively translating technical concepts for general audiences remains an ongoing challenge.

### Critical Reflections

The experiment revealed several areas where reality diverged from expectations:

- Only 4 of many volunteers engaged with new systems, highlighting the gap between technical readiness and social adoption
- The planned workshop wasn't delivered as designed, indicating misalignment with community readiness
- All core team members experienced personal transitions during implementation, affecting available time and focus
- The conceptual gap between Web3 thinking and mainstream understanding was consistently wider than anticipated

These challenges don't represent failures but rather valuable learnings about the reality of Web3 adoption at community level.

## Assessment & Evolution

### Pattern/Approach Performance

Through implementation, several replicable patterns emerged that other organizations might adapt:

**Multisig Governance**
- Setup: 2-of-4 signature requirement for financial decisions
- Tools: Gnosis Safe, integrated with ENS
- Result: Operational but limited to core team
- Lesson: Social protocols more important than technical setup

**Local Web3 Chapters**
- Process: Apply to global network, establish local governance, hold regular meetings
- Frequency: Monthly gatherings with consistent small group
- Focus: Building relationships over formal structure
- Outcome: Sustained engagement from committed participants

**Impact Documentation Evolution**
- Original: Organization-specific hypercerts
- Adapted: Ecosystem-standard tools (Karma GAP)
- Benefit: Enabled participation in funding rounds
- Learning: Compatibility trumps customization

**Emergent Pattern: Opportunistic Web3 Adoption**
A new pattern emerged for community organizations entering Web3:
1. Build technical readiness with small team
2. Maintain flexibility to respond to opportunities
3. Prioritize ecosystem compatibility over unique solutions
4. Use external validation to build internal momentum
5. Accept extended timelines while celebrating progress

### Sustainability and Continuation

Building on the foundation established during the experiment, ICS has identified immediate priorities for fall 2025:
- Launch 8-week education cohort combining learning with practical application
- Conduct public quadratic funding demonstration at local event
- Implement "stealth" Web3 integration through familiar tools
- Document and share cohort curriculum openly

Looking beyond immediate next steps, ICS has established goals for sustainable Web3 integration over the next year including achieving 10+ active participants, integrating governance tools into regular operations, and expanding Green Pill London activities.

### Transferable Insights

Core principles that transcend context:
- Technical infrastructure can be built quickly, but social adoption requires 6-18 month timelines
- Start with committed core teams before attempting broader adoption
- Make experiences enjoyable to overcome complexity barriers
- Flexibility and opportunism yield better results than rigid planning
- External validation accelerates internal confidence and adoption

### Knowledge Contribution

This experiment validates existing understanding about the challenges of Web3 adoption while contributing new insights about community motivations. The discovery that communities primarily seek participation rather than resources reframes how organizations might approach Web3 integration. The "Opportunistic Web3 Adoption" pattern offers a pragmatic approach for resource-constrained organizations in conservative communities.

## Conclusion

The ICS Web3 governance experiment demonstrated both the potential and challenges of implementing decentralized tools in community organizations. While adoption remained limited to four core users, the experiment established functional infrastructure, achieved unexpected successes like top 10% GG23 ranking, and generated valuable insights about community needs and adoption patterns.

The key discovery—that communities seek participation over resources—reframes how organizations might approach Web3 integration. Rather than focusing primarily on funding mechanisms, successful adoption requires addressing fundamental desires for agency and voice in decision-making.

For practitioners, ICS's experience offers practical guidance: start small with committed teams, prioritize enjoyment and accessibility, maintain flexibility for opportunities, and prepare for 6-18 month adoption timelines. The path to decentralized governance requires patience and persistence, but early experiments like ICS's provide essential learning for the broader movement toward participatory, regenerative organizational models.
