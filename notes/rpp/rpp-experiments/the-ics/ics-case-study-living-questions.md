# ICS Case Study - Step 1.8: Living Questions

## Living Questions

### 1. What Would It Take to Pilot an Alternative Economic System in London?

**The Question:** "What would it take to pilot an alternative economic system here in London, Ontario?" (Reflections)

**Why it emerged:** Scott Morris's workshop on community currencies opened unexpected possibilities for "developing a commitment pooling system for London." The combination of Web3 infrastructure and local sustainability focus suggests potential for deeper economic experimentation.

**Why it matters:** This represents an evolution from governance tools to economic transformation - a natural progression that could demonstrate Web3's practical value to skeptical communities.

**Who might explore:** 
- ICS with community currency experts
- Local businesses and timebanking initiatives
- Economic development agencies interested in resilience

**Broader connection:** Links to global experiments in local currencies, mutual credit systems, and regenerative economics.

### 2. How Can Web3 Serve the Most Disadvantaged?

**The Question:** "How could web3 tools serve the needs of the most disadvantaged people in our city?" (Reflections)

**Why it emerged:** The experiment engaged primarily tech-comfortable middle-class participants. The core team recognized the gap between Web3's promise of inclusion and current reality of exclusive participation.

**Why it matters:** Without addressing accessibility for vulnerable populations, Web3 risks reinforcing existing inequalities rather than enabling broader participation.

**Who might explore:**
- Social service organizations with Web3 partners
- Universal basic income pilots
- Digital inclusion initiatives

**Research needs:** Systematic study of barriers faced by different demographic groups in accessing Web3 tools.

### 3. How to Make Tools Accessible to Non-Technical Users?

**The Question:** "How can we make web3 tools so easy and seamless that even my mom could use it?" (Reflections)

**Why it emerged:** Despite efforts at simplification, communication barriers persisted. The "technical jargon and conceptual gap proved larger than expected" throughout the experiment.

**Why it matters:** Mass adoption requires grandmother-friendly interfaces. Current complexity limits Web3 to a technical elite.

**Who might explore:**
- UX designers specializing in accessibility
- Projects like "stealth integration" through familiar tools (ticketing, etc.)
- Academic researchers in human-computer interaction

**Strategic implications:** May require fundamental rethinking of how Web3 tools are presented and accessed.

### 4. What's the Minimum Viable Community for Sustainable Adoption?

**The Question:** "What's the minimum viable community for sustainable web3 adoption?" (Emerging from 4-person consistent participation)

**Why it emerged:** The experiment succeeded with 4 core members but struggled to expand. This raises questions about critical mass for self-sustaining adoption.

**Why it matters:** Understanding minimum thresholds helps others set realistic goals and identify when to pivot strategies.

**Who might explore:**
- Network scientists studying adoption curves
- Other local Web3 experiments tracking participation
- Social movement researchers

**Research needs:** Comparative analysis across multiple local Web3 initiatives to identify patterns.

### 5. How to Balance Innovation with Accessibility?

**The Question:** "How do we balance innovation with accessibility?" (Reflections)

**Why it emerged:** Tension throughout between using cutting-edge tools (exciting for early adopters) and making them understandable (necessary for broader adoption).

**Why it matters:** This tension may be fundamental to all technology adoption, requiring conscious strategies rather than hoping it resolves naturally.

**Future exploration areas:**
- Progressive disclosure interfaces
- Multiple entry points for different user types
- Cultural translation approaches

### 6. What Does It Take to Sustain Engagement Over 12+ Months?

**The Question:** "What it takes to onboard and retain 5-50 new people in web3 for 12+ months" (Reflections)

**Why it emerged:** The experiment maintained 4 participants consistently but recognized that broader adoption requires sustained engagement strategies not yet developed.

**Why it matters:** Long-term engagement is necessary for meaningful governance participation. Initial enthusiasm often fades without proper support structures.

**Who might explore:**
- Community organizing experts
- Behavioral economists studying habit formation
- Successful DAOs with high retention rates

**Strategic importance:** Answer determines whether local Web3 adoption can scale beyond enthusiasts.

### 7. How Can Local Success Translate to Systemic Change?

**The Question:** How can small experiments like ICS contribute to "a global transition to an economy where cooperation and mutualism replace extraction and exploitation"? (Discovery Report vision)

**Why it emerged:** Gap between grand vision and modest reality (4 participants) raises questions about pathways from local experiments to systemic transformation.

**Why it matters:** Without clear scaling strategies, local experiments remain isolated inspiration rather than catalysts for broader change.

**Research needs:** 
- Mapping successful scaling patterns from other movements
- Understanding network effects in social transformation
- Policy research on supportive frameworks

### 8. What Happens When Technical Infrastructure Outpaces Social Readiness?

**The Question:** How do we manage the gap when "infrastructure is in place but integration into daily operations is still 6-18 months away"? (Reflections)

**Why it emerged:** ICS built complete technical infrastructure quickly but social adoption lagged significantly, creating an "infrastructure waiting for users" situation.

**Why it matters:** This pattern likely repeats across Web3 initiatives. Understanding how to bridge this gap could accelerate adoption timelines.

**Future exploration:**
- Staged rollout strategies
- Social preparation before technical deployment
- Maintaining momentum during adoption gaps

### 9. Can Web3 Adoption Happen Without Explaining Web3?

**The Question:** Is "stealth integration" through familiar tools the path to adoption rather than education about Web3 itself?

**Why it emerged:** Communication challenges persisted despite multiple approaches. Team considering hiding Web3 complexity behind familiar interfaces (event ticketing, etc.).

**Why it matters:** Fundamentally questions whether Web3 education is necessary or if benefits can be delivered without users understanding underlying technology.

**Who might explore:**
- Product designers building Web3 backends with Web2 interfaces
- Marketing researchers studying technology adoption patterns
- Communities tired of blockchain evangelism

### 10. What New Governance Models Emerge from Small-Scale Experiments?

**The Question:** What governance innovations become possible when starting with 4 people that wouldn't work at larger scales?

**Why it emerged:** Small team developed "shared vocabulary and understanding" enabling coordination patterns impossible in larger groups. What unique governance models does this enable?

**Why it matters:** Small-scale experiments might discover new patterns invisible at larger scales, contributing novel approaches to the commons.

**Research potential:** Document emerging governance patterns unique to small, high-trust groups using Web3 tools.

## Summary of Living Questions

These ten questions reveal that the ICS experiment, while achieving its immediate goals, has opened more questions than it answered. The questions span from practical concerns (tool accessibility) to systemic challenges (scaling local experiments to global transformation). 

Key themes in the questions:
- **Accessibility and inclusion** - Making Web3 serve everyone, not just technical elites
- **Scaling and sustainability** - Moving from 4 to 40 to 400 participants
- **Economic transformation** - Beyond governance to alternative economic systems
- **Strategic choices** - Whether to hide or highlight Web3 technology

These living questions position the ICS experiment as the beginning of a longer journey rather than a completed project, inviting continued experimentation, research, and collective learning across the regenerative movement.
