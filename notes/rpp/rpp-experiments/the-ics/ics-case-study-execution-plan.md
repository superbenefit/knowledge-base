# ICS Case Study Execution Strategy

This strategy customizes the case study synthesis workflow for the Institute for Community Sustainability's Web3 governance experiment. It follows the established workflow steps while incorporating ICS-specific content, links, and considerations to create a case study that honestly documents the experiment's journey from January-July 2025.

## Core Finding to Maintain Throughout

The ICS experiment revealed that communities want participation and voice, not just new funding mechanisms. While only 4 people actively use the Web3 infrastructure (against broader volunteer base), this outcome provides valuable learning about the gap between technical readiness and social adoption. The strategy maintains honest complexity while extracting transferable insights.

## Step 1: Review Requirements

✅ **COMPLETED**

**Summary of Actions:**
- Reviewed synthesis phase requirements from tools/workflows/artifacts/case-studies/synthesis/readme.md
- Analyzed synthesis workflow documentation 
- Confirmed understanding of multi-audience needs (funders, practitioners, communities, researchers)
- Identified key requirements: narrative arc, evidence of impact, multiple perspectives, honest complexity
- Applied ICS-specific context around limited adoption (4 users) as foundation-building rather than failure

Start by understanding what the synthesis phase aims to accomplish and how it serves multiple audiences.

**ICS-Specific Context**:

- Part of SuperBenefit's Reimagining Power Project
- Multiple stakeholder groups: ICS volunteers, GreenPill participants, Web3 community, RPP partners
- Emphasis on honest documentation over compelling narrative

## Step 2: Document Assembly

✅ **COMPLETED**

**Summary of Actions:**
- Retrieved and analyzed all three primary documents (Discovery, Scoping, Reflection)
- Created comprehensive document inventory with artifact ID: ics-doc-analysis
- Identified key information gaps: budget details, participant testimonials, demographics
- Mapped story arc from ambitious plans to patient experimentation
- Discovered additional resources in notes/ics/ directory

Gather all ICS experiment documentation for comprehensive review.

**ICS Document Inventory**:

- **Discovery Report**: `notes/rpp/rpp-experiments/the-ics/ICS Discovery Report.md`
- **Experiment Scoping**: `notes/rpp/rpp-experiments/the-ics/ICS Experiment Scoping.md`
- **Reflection Document**: `notes/rpp/rpp-experiments/the-ics/ICS Experiment Reflections.md`

- Experiment Scoping: notes/rpp/rpp-experiments/the-ics/ICS Experiment Scoping.md  
- Reflection Document: notes/rpp/rpp-experiments/the-ics/ICS Experiment Reflections.md

Extract:
1. PLANNED VS ACTUAL:
   - What was supposed to happen (from Scoping)
   - What actually happened (from Reflection)
   - Where reality diverged from plans

2. PATTERN IDENTIFICATION:
   - What themes appear across all documents?
   - Which challenges persist throughout?
   - What unexpected elements emerged?

3. VOICE ANALYSIS:
   - Whose perspectives dominate?
   - Whose voices are missing?
   - Where do perspectives conflict?

4. EVIDENCE INVENTORY:
   - Quantitative data available

   - Supporting materials referenced

Present findings objectively without interpretation.
```

**Human Document Review Tasks**:

- Create a document review checklist noting:
    - What each document contains
    - Information gaps (e.g., participant testimonials, detailed engagement metrics)
    - Conflicting information between documents
    - Missing stakeholder perspectives

**Fresh Eyes Review Questions**:

- Where did plans diverge from reality?
- What patterns appear across documents?
- Which voices are prominent vs. missing?
- What evidence supports key claims?

## Step 3: Pattern Extraction with Worksheet

✅ **COMPLETED**

**Summary of Actions:**
- Created comprehensive synthesis worksheet with artifact ID: ics-synthesis-worksheet
- Extracted six key pattern areas from documentation
- Identified core journey arc from governance bottlenecks to 4-user foundation
- Documented key insight: shift from "bringing resources" to "enabling participation"
- Captured honest complexity including "we sidestepped community engagement LOL"

Use the synthesis worksheet to systematically extract key elements from ICS documentation.

**AI-Assisted Worksheet Completion Prompt**:

```
Using these ICS experiment documents, help complete the synthesis worksheet sections:

Discovery Report: notes/rpp/rpp-experiments/the-ics/ICS Discovery Report.md
Scoping Document: notes/rpp/rpp-experiments/the-ics/ICS Experiment Scoping.md  
Reflection Document: notes/rpp/rpp-experiments/the-ics/ICS Experiment Reflections.md

For each worksheet section, extract specific, factual information:

1. THE JOURNEY ARC:
- Starting point: Governance bottlenecks, limited volunteer engagement
- Catalyst: OTF funding and RPP participation
- Key milestones: Infrastructure setup, GG23 participation, GreenPill meetings
- Evolution: From "bringing resources" to "enabling participation"
- Ending point: 4 active users, ongoing evolution

2. THREADS THAT CONNECT:
- Technical infrastructure vs. social adoption gap
- Opportunistic approach yielding unexpected success
- Small core team as foundation for future growth
- Communication challenges persisting throughout

3. MULTIPLE STORIES:
- Core team (4 people): Deep engagement with tools
- ICS volunteers: Limited engagement despite infrastructure
- GreenPill participants: Interest in participation over tech
- Note whose stories are missing

4. EVIDENCE OF CHANGE:
- Quantitative: 4 users, 4 meetings, top 10% GG23
- Qualitative: Team cohesion, shared vocabulary
- System: Governance infrastructure operational
- Cultural: Acceptance of longer timelines

5. HONEST COMPLEXITY:
- Workshop not delivered as planned
- Limited community engagement ("we sidestepped community engagement LOL")
- Team capacity constraints
- Wider conceptual gap than expected

6. INSIGHTS THAT TRAVEL:
- Patience as prerequisite for Web3 adoption
- Fun as fundamental to overcome complexity
- Emergence over rigid planning
- Small experiments can yield big opportunities

Include direct quotes and specific examples wherever possible.
```

**Human Quality Check**:

- Are insights grounded in specific events?
- Is complexity presented without excuses?
- Do patterns feel authentic vs. imposed?

## Step 4: AI-Assisted Narrative Development

✅ **COMPLETED**

**Summary of Actions:**
- Created full case study draft with artifact ID: ics-case-study
- Developed all sections: Executive Summary, Background, Approach, Transformation Story, Outcomes, Learnings, Patterns
- Maintained objective tone throughout per feedback
- Removed narrative flourishes and kept factual focus
- Revised executive summary to remove granular details after review

Transform worksheet content into case study sections using provided prompts, maintaining factual focus.

### Executive Summary

```
Create a 300-400 word executive summary for the ICS case study:

Key highlights from worksheet:
- Set up complete Web3 governance infrastructure (multisig, ENS, Hats, etc.)
- 4 people actively using tools (exceeded goal of 3+)
- Top 10% in GG23 despite being first attempt
- Discovered communities want participation, not just funding

Major transformations:
- Shift from "bringing resources in" to "enabling participation"
- From single workshop to 8-week cohort model
- From traditional hypercerts to Karma GAP

Primary insights:
- Web3 adoption requires patience and sustained engagement
- Technical infrastructure alone doesn't drive adoption
- Opportunistic approach can yield unexpected success
- The conceptual gap between Web3 and mainstream is vast

Stakeholder impacts:
- Core team gained Web3 fluency
- Broader volunteer base not yet engaged
- GreenPill London chapter established

Write objectively, letting facts speak for themselves. Acknowledge limited adoption alongside achievements.
```

### Background and Context

```
Develop the background section using:

Organizational context from Discovery:
- ICS is federal not-for-profit in London, Ontario
- Runs Repair Café, Thing Library, community workshops
- Centralized governance creating bottlenecks
- Strong volunteer base but limited agency

Initial challenges:
- Decision-making bottlenecks
- Volunteer engagement limitations
- Funding sustainability concerns
- Need for community ownership

Why change needed:
- RPP opportunity to prototype new governance
- Desire to connect with global regenerative movement
- Need to address systemic challenges

Present facts about ICS and challenges without editorializing. Let readers understand context.
```

### Transformation Story

```
Structure the ICS transformation story:

Phase 1: "Setting the Foundation" (Jan-Mar 2025)
Facts to include:
- Multisig wallet established (0x3B454B53B4c414fFa8297EC49C9d5F040Cf035f8)
- ENS domain (theics.eth), Hats Protocol (Tree 100/119)
- CharmVerse and Snapshot spaces created
- 4 people trained on tools
- Quote: Assumption that "governance systems operational" would drive adoption

Phase 2: "Discovering Reality" (Mar-May 2025)
Facts to include:
- GreenPill application approved
- 4 meetings held (vs 1 planned)
- ETHDenver and Consensus Toronto participation
- Pivot from hypercert to Karma GAP for GG23
- Community feedback: want to "do" not just learn

Phase 3: "Adapting Approach" (May-July 2025)
Facts to include:
- GG23 campaign achieving top 10% 
- Workshop model shifted to cohort design
- Plans for fall QF demonstration
- Only 4 active users but strong cohesion
- Recognition that timeline is 6-18 months not weeks

Present chronologically without imposing narrative arc. Include specific dates, numbers, decisions.
```

### Approach and Methodology

```
Document ICS's strategic approach:

Interventions from Scoping Document:
1. Governance Infrastructure - multisig, ENS, Hats, Snapshot, CharmVerse
2. Hypercerts for Repair Café - evolved to Karma GAP
3. GreenPill Chapter - application, setup, meetings
4. Web3 Onboarding - workshop development (incomplete)

Why these approaches:
- Quote rationale from scoping document
- Note alignment with RPP goals
- Connection to ICS challenges

Adaptations made:
- Hypercert → Karma GAP (for GG23 compatibility)
- Single workshop → 8-week cohort model
- Rigid timeline → opportunistic response

Resources used:
- Volunteer hours (hundreds)
- RPP technical support and facilitation
- Existing ICS infrastructure and relationships

Document what was planned vs. what happened without judgment.
```

### Outcomes and Impact

```
Present ICS transformation evidence:

Quantitative changes:
- Governance users: 0 → 4 (goal 3+) ✓
- Infrastructure: 0 → fully operational ✓
- GreenPill meetings: 1 planned → 4 held ✓
- GG23 result: First attempt → Top 10% ✓
- Workshop delivery: Not completed

Qualitative shifts:
- "The experiment has fostered connection and co-creation among the 4 members"
- Shared Web3 vocabulary developed
- Strategic shift from resources to participation
- Team confidence from GG23 success

Stakeholder experiences:
- Core team: Deep engagement, regular tool use
- ICS volunteers: No significant engagement yet
- GreenPill participants: 4 regular attendees
- External validation: GG23 community support

Present outcomes factually. Let readers assess success/failure.
```

### Key Learnings

```
Extract transferable insights from ICS experience:

Insights with evidence:
1. "Patience as prerequisite" - 6-18 month timeline reality vs weeks expected
2. "Fun as fundamental" - Community feedback on needing enjoyable experiences
3. "Emergence over planning" - GG23 and conference opportunities
4. "Small core team can suffice" - 4 users as foundation not failure
5. "Communication barriers are real" - Struggle to explain Web3 value

Patterns validated:
- Technical readiness precedes social readiness
- Existing relationships enable experimentation
- External validation (GG23) builds internal confidence

Challenges to share:
- Workshop model assumptions invalid
- Community engagement can't be forced
- Capacity constraints affect timeline
- Conceptual gap wider than expected

Questions remaining:
- Minimum viable community size?
- How to bridge conceptual gap?
- Sustainability without broader adoption?

Present as observations and questions, not prescriptions.
```

### Pattern Documentation

```
Document patterns for knowledge commons:

Patterns attempted:
1. Multisig Governance
   - Implementation: Gnosis Safe with 4 signers
   - Performance: Operational but limited to core team
   - Learning: Technical success ≠ adoption

2. On-chain Impact Measurement  
   - Original: Traditional hypercerts
   - Adapted: Karma GAP for ecosystem compatibility
   - Performance: Enabled GG23 participation
   
3. Local Web3 Chapter
   - Implementation: GreenPill London
   - Performance: 4 consistent participants
   - Learning: Regular meetings > big launch

4. Progressive Onboarding
   - Original: Single workshop
   - Evolved: 8-week cohort model (pending)
   - Learning: Depth > breadth for Web3 education

New pattern discovered:
"Opportunistic Web3 Adoption" - Responding to opportunities (GG23, conferences) rather than forcing predetermined paths yielded better outcomes than planned activities.

Document what worked, what didn't, and why.
```

## Implementation Notes

**Managing Objectivity**: When in doubt, state facts and let readers interpret. Avoid words like "successful," "innovative," or "strategic" unless quoting participants.

**Addressing Gaps**: Note where information is missing (participant testimonials, detailed metrics) rather than glossing over.

**Maintaining Focus**: The core insight—communities want participation not just resources—should emerge from evidence, not be imposed as theme.

**Timeline Clarity**: Be explicit that this documents January-July 2025, with evolution continuing.

This strategy produces a case study that serves as honest documentation of an ongoing experiment, providing value to multiple stakeholders while contributing to collective learning about Web3 adoption at the community level.
