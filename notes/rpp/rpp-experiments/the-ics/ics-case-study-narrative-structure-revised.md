# ICS Case Study - Step 2: Narrative Structure (Revised)

## The Real Story We Need to Tell

Let me be honest about what actually happened here, because it's more interesting than the typical "nonprofit adopts blockchain" narrative.

### The Hook That Matters

Four people in London, Ontario built Web3 governance infrastructure that no one else at their nonprofit uses yet—and this might be exactly the success story the sector needs to hear.

Not because it's a story of mass adoption or revolutionary change, but because it reveals something profound about how communities actually want to engage with decentralized technology: they don't want your money, they want a voice.

### The Heart of the Narrative

This is fundamentally a story about discovering that everything we thought Web3 was for might be wrong. The ICS team started where everyone starts—thinking blockchain would help them access new funding. They had a $100,000 grant, a mandate to experiment, and dreams of hypercerts bringing regenerative finance to London.

Seven months later, they'd achieved something unexpected:
- Top 10% ranking in a global funding round (Gitcoin Grants)
- A thriving GreenPill chapter (okay, thriving = 4 consistent members)
- Complete governance infrastructure that works
- And most importantly: the realization that their community doesn't give a damn about crypto funding—they want to participate in decisions

### The Structure That Serves This Story

**Part 1: The Reasonable Beginning**
Start with ICS as they were—a successful nonprofit with real programs (Repair Café, Thing Library) hitting the classic bottleneck: centralized governance that burns out leaders and disempowers volunteers. Enter the Reimagining Power Project with $100k to experiment. 

Key context that matters:
- London, Ontario is not San Francisco. It's conservative, skeptical of trends, needs proof
- ICS already had trust and programs that work
- The team saw Web3 as a potential funding solution (spoiler: they were wrong)

**Part 2: The Messy Middle (Where the Learning Lives)**

This is where we need to be radically honest. Structure this as three phases but emphasize the chaos:

*Phase 1: Building for No One (Jan-Feb 2025)*
- They built everything right: multisig, ENS, Hats Protocol, the works
- RPP's templates made it technically smooth
- But here's the kicker: only the 4 core team members cared
- First sign something was off: the wider volunteer base didn't engage at all

*Phase 2: Unexpected Doors Open (Mar-May 2025)*
- GreenPill meetings start—same 4 people every time
- Then opportunities cascade: ETHDenver invite, Consensus Toronto, GG23 opens
- Critical moment: They chase opportunities instead of forcing their plan
- GG23 success shocks everyone (top 10%!)—but locals still don't care

*Phase 3: The Pivot That Wasn't (May-July 2025)*
- Scott Morris workshop on community currencies sparks new thinking
- Community feedback is brutal: "We want to DO things, not learn about Web3"
- The revelation: People resonate with participation and agency, not funding mechanisms
- Workshop plans transform from "Web3 101" to 8-week hands-on cohort

**Part 3: What This Actually Means**

Don't wrap this up neatly. Instead, be clear about the gap between vision and reality:

What worked:
- Infrastructure is bulletproof and waiting
- Core team has deep shared understanding
- Global networks embraced them warmly
- They learned what actually matters to communities

What didn't:
- Broader adoption is 6-18 months away (at least)
- Communication barriers remain massive
- Only 4 people are actually using any of this
- The budget is largely unspent

The profound insight:
- Communities want sovereignty and voice, not charity
- Small teams can prototype governance futures
- Patience isn't optional—it's the whole game
- You can't explain Web3 benefits; you have to demonstrate them

### Key Narrative Threads to Weave Throughout

1. **The participation revelation**: Track how their thinking evolved from "Web3 brings money" to "Web3 enables voice"

2. **The four-person reality**: Don't hide that only 4 people use this. Make it the feature, not the bug. This is how all transformation starts.

3. **London as character**: The city's conservative culture isn't backdrop—it's a key player that shapes everything

4. **Personal stakes**: All 4 team members were going through life transitions. This human element matters.

5. **The communication wall**: Every section should touch on how bloody hard it is to explain this stuff to normal people

### Evidence Strategy That Feels Real

- Lead with GG23 ranking when you need credibility
- Use the "4 people" number repeatedly—own it
- Quote the evolution: "bringing resources in" → "enabling participation"
- Show the timeline flexibility as wisdom, not failure
- Include the "we sidestepped community engagement LOL" quote—that honesty is gold

### Serving Multiple Masters (Without Sounding Like It)

**For funders**: The money story is efficiency—minimal spend, maximum learning, foundation laid for long-term impact. GG23 proves capability.

**For practitioners**: The real playbook is patience + small team + flexibility + documentation. Share the actual tools and timelines.

**For researchers**: The participation insight is your theoretical contribution. The living questions are your research agenda.

**For communities**: This is about your neighbors figuring out how to have more say in what happens locally, using tools that are hard to explain but might be worth the effort.

### The Ending That Opens

Don't conclude—expand. The case study should end with:

- The 8-week cohort plan (concrete next step)
- The public QF demo idea (ambitious but grounded)
- The alternative economic system question (the big dream)
- An invitation: "We have infrastructure waiting for users and questions waiting for answers"

### Visual Moments That Matter

1. **The gradient of engagement**: Visual showing 4 core → ICS volunteers → GreenPill participants → broader London
2. **Timeline showing planned vs. actual**: Emphasize the opportunities that disrupted plans
3. **The pivot visualization**: Funding focus → Participation focus
4. **Global/local tension**: Conference invites vs. local skepticism

### Tone and Voice Notes

- Write like you're explaining to a smart friend who knows nothing about Web3
- Use "bloody hard" and "LOL" naturally—this isn't academic writing
- Include enough technical detail to be credible, not so much that eyes glaze
- Let frustration show alongside excitement
- Make the reader feel the patience required

### The Meta-Message

This case study itself demonstrates their key insight: you can't just tell people about Web3's benefits, you have to show them through story, through specifics, through honest complexity. Make the case study do what they're trying to do—demonstrate value through transparent, participatory documentation of real experience.

The story arc isn't "challenge → solution → success." It's "assumption → experiment → discovery → more questions." And that's exactly what makes it useful.
