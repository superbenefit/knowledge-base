# Scope of Work

This work will cover the following domains of activity:

## Governance

- Set up an ICS multisignature wallet for financial decision-making.

- Establish an Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain for ICS.

- Define roles using the Hats Protocol for decentralized access control.

- Create a Cell State document to outline the structure and responsibilities of governance cells.

- Configure a Snapshot space for on-chain voting and governance.

- Launch an ICS CharmVerse space for collaboration and documentation.

- Integrate ICS into SuperBenefit's on-chain accounting system.

## **Mint a Hypercert for the Repair Café Initiative** 

As part of its commitment to transparent and measurable impact, ICS will mint one or more Hypercerts to document the environmental and social contributions of the Repair Café initiative. This will serve as a pioneering step in utilizing blockchain-based tools to establish verifiable and immutable proof of the initiative’s outcomes, in the process opening up the potential of future retroactive public goods funding for ICS.

The Hypercert could detail key metrics such as:

- **Environmental Impact:** Quantifiable data on waste diverted from landfills through repaired items extending product lifespans and reducing resource consumption.

- **Community Engagement:** The number of participants, repairs completed, and volunteers mobilized to foster community resilience and empowerment.

- **Educational Outcomes:** Skills and knowledge imparted to participants, contributing to long-term behavioural change and community-led sustainability efforts.

### Roles & Responsibilities

RPP’s Contribution:

- **Design and Facilitation Support:** Collaborate with ICS to define the scope, metrics, and structure of the Hypercert. This includes identifying key impact metrics (e.g., waste diverted, community participation) and ensuring the design reflects transparency, measurable impact, and alignment with sustainability and community-focused values.

- **Technical Implementation Support:** Guide ICS through the process of minting the Hypercert and issuing attestations using the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS).

ICS’ Contribution:

- **Data Collection:** ICS will gather the data and evidence needed to support the Hypercert, including statistics, testimonials, and metrics from the Repair Café initiative.

- **Validation and Feedback:** ICS will ensure that the Hypercert reflects accurate, community-validated impact metrics by facilitating stakeholder review and input.

- **Mint and Publicize the Hypercert:** ICS will be responsible for minting the hypercert on the selected platform, using the collected data and RPP's design support. Once minted, ICS will publicize the Hypercert to stakeholders and to ReFi communities, to showcase the Repair Café's contributions and foster engagement with the initiative.

## **Green Pill Local Chapter**

#### Establish the Governance Infrastructure

To launch a Green Pill Network (GPN) local chapter in London, ON, ICS will establish the necessary governance infrastructure. This includes setting up a dedicated governance cell and a multisignature (multisig) wallet to facilitate decentralized decision-making and financial management. This structure ensures alignment with both ICS and SuperBenefit's governance principles, creating a solid foundation for the chapter's operations.

Before moving forward, it is essential to assess whether nesting the GPN chapter under SuperBenefit's organizational framework is the most suitable approach. This evaluation will involve discussions with key stakeholders from both ICS and SuperBenefit to ensure alignment with their respective missions, processes, and goals. The chosen structure must be amenable to all parties to promote sustainability and collaboration.

#### Apply for Recognition as an Official GPN Chapter

GPN is currently in the process of implementing a new onboarding process for local chapters, including a formalized application procedure. ICS has maintained active communication with several GPN stewards to ensure its readiness to submit a strong application. These stewards have indicated a willingness to vouch for ICS and expedite its application once the new process is in place. By cultivating these relationships, ICS aims to secure recognition as a local chapter efficiently while adhering to the latest GPN guidelines.

### Host the First Chapter Meeting

ICS has been actively raising awareness of the Green Pill Network at local community events and will continue its outreach efforts leading up to the chapter's first meeting. This outreach includes engaging with individuals, community groups, local organizations, and tech businesses to build a diverse and vibrant contributor base.

The first chapter meeting will serve as both an onboarding session for stakeholders and an opportunity to outline the chapter's vision and goals. It will introduce GPN principles, governance structures, and potential projects to the London community. The meeting will prioritize inclusivity and collaboration, creating a welcoming space for participants to explore ways they can contribute to and benefit from the chapter’s initiatives.

### Roles & Responsibilities

RPP’s Contribution: 

- **Governance Infrastructure Design:** RPP will provide templates, facilitation, and technical guidance to set up the governance infrastructure, including the multisig wallet, Hats Protocol roles, and Snapshot space. 

- **Application Support:** RPP will support ICS’s application to become an official Green Pill Network chapter by advising on the application process and leveraging connections with GPN stewards to ensure the application is vouchsafed and fast-tracked.

- **Initial Chapter Meeting Support:** RPP will provide input on the structure, agenda, and facilitation methods for the first chapter meeting, ensuring alignment with GPN and RPP principles. 

ICS’s Contribution: 

- **Hosting and Outreach:** ICS will lead the hosting of the first chapter meeting, including managing event logistics, inviting stakeholders, and conducting local outreach to community groups, organizations, and businesses.

- **Ongoing Engagement:** ICS will build on the momentum from the initial meeting to grow the chapter, focusing on member engagement and planning local initiatives aligned with Green Pill Network values.

## **Onboardin****g to web3**

Onboarding more Londoners to web3 tools and principles is essential for fostering meaningful engagement with the ICS's experiment and with the Green Pill Network. By equipping participants with the knowledge and skills to navigate web3 platforms, the onboarding process will help break down barriers to participation, build confidence, and empower contributors to engage fully with decentralized governance and regenerative initiatives, creating a more inclusive and collaborative local community in the process.

By leveraging RPP’s expertise in Web3 and ICS’s strong local connections, the onboarding process will effectively integrate new contributors while fostering a sense of community and shared purpose.

### Roles & Responsibilities

RPP’s Contribution:

- **Workshop Design:** RPP will design a structured onboarding workshop tailored to participants’ varying familiarity with Web3. This includes developing materials such as guides, presentations, and interactive exercises that explain Web3 basics, use cases, governance platforms, and collaboration tools.

- **Web3 Tools Training:** Provide technical training and support for the ICS to be able to onboard participants to key Web3 tools like wallets, governance platforms, and collaborative spaces

ICS’s Contribution: 

- **Community Outreach and Participant Recruitment:** ICS, in collaboration with the emerging Green Pill London network, will lead outreach efforts to identify and invite participants for the onboarding workshop. Outreach will target individuals and organizations aligned with the Green Pill Network’s mission, emphasizing diversity and inclusivity. 

- **Feedback and Iteration:** ICS will collect feedback from participants during and after the pilot workshop. This feedback will be used to refine the onboarding flow and improve future sessions. ICS will share key insights with RPP to ensure continuous improvement and alignment with community needs.

### Exclusions

This work will **not** cover:

- Piloting a quadratic funding (QF) experiment

  - **Reason for Exclusion:** While a quadratic funding experiment aligns with the broader goals of the RP project in exploring innovative, participatory funding mechanisms, it requires significant technical infrastructure, stakeholder engagement, and community readiness. At this stage, the focus is on establishing foundational governance structures and community engagement mechanisms. Without a solid base of governance and a well-onboarded contributor pool, a QF experiment may face operational or community adoption challenges.

  - **Future Plans:** The QF experiment can be revisited in a subsequent phase, post-March 2025, when governance is well-established, and the Green Pill Network chapter has demonstrated a steady flow of engaged participants. This will allow for a more robust design and implementation of the experiment.

- **Participation in Breadchain initiatives**

  - **Reason for Exclusion:** Breadchain’s cooperative model and focus on mutual aid align conceptually with ICS’s mission, but several prerequisites need to be addressed. First, ICS’s governance systems must mature to meet Breadchain's standards for financial and democratic operations. Additionally, Breadchain is a relationship-driven network that relies on strong trust and collaboration among its members. Building these relationships requires significant time and consistent engagement with the network, which is not feasible within the current timeline and resource constraints of this workstream.

  - **Future Plans:** Relationship building with Breadchain and its members will be a priority before initiating formal participation. This will involve attending Breadchain-related events, engaging with its contributors, and finding opportunities for small-scale collaborations to establish mutual trust and alignment. Once relationships are strengthened and ICS demonstrates readiness, participation could be pursued, potentially later in 2025.
