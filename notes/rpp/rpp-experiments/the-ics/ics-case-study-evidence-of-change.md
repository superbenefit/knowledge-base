- **Spent:** "Not very much of the budget was spent" (Reflections)
- **Evidence:** Achieved all deliverables with minimal financial expenditure
- **Why it matters:** Demonstrates efficient use of resources and volunteer-driven model

### Qualitative Evidence

#### Team Collaboration and Ownership
**What changed:** Relationship dynamics within core team
- **Before:** Centralized decision-making with limited volunteer agency
- **Evidence:** "**Strengthened collaboration**: The experiment has fostered connection and co-creation among the 4 members actively involved" (Reflections)
- **Evidence:** "Within the core team of 4, everyone now feels some ownership of ICS" (Reflections)
- **Why it matters:** Addresses original challenge of limited volunteer agency and community ownership

#### Shared Understanding and Language
**What changed:** Team capacity for Web3 governance
- **Before:** Limited Web3 knowledge
- **After:** Common vocabulary and practices
- **Evidence:** "**Shared language**: Team now has shared vocabulary and understanding around web3 governance concepts" (Reflections)
- **Why it matters:** Essential foundation for teaching others and expanding adoption

#### Strategic Focus Evolution
**What changed:** Understanding of Web3's value proposition
- **Before:** "The team originally focused on impact attestations and bringing external web3 funding into the community" (Reflections)
- **After:** "Real interest lies in participation and agency - people want to be involved in decisions that affect them" (Reflections)
- **Why it matters:** Fundamental shift aligns technology with community needs rather than imposing external solutions

#### Global Network Integration
**What changed:** Connection to broader regenerative movement
- **Before:** Isolated local nonprofit
- **After:** Recognized node in global networks
- **Evidence:** 
  - GreenPill chapter approved by global network
  - Participation in ETHDenver and Consensus Toronto
  - Integration with Gitcoin community through GG23
  - "London joining a global movement for positive change" (Reflections)
- **Why it matters:** Access to resources, legitimacy, and knowledge exchange

#### Community Understanding
**What changed:** Awareness of Web3's potential for local impact
- **Before:** No understanding of Web3 applications
- **After:** "Participants are definitely becoming more aware of the potential of web3 on a local level" (Reflections)
- **Evidence:** Consistent GreenPill meeting attendance and engagement
- **Why it matters:** Building foundation for future adoption

### Unexpected Outcomes

#### Conference Opportunities
**What emerged:** Invitations to major Web3 events
- **Evidence:** 
  - "Heenal had the opportunity to attend ETHDenver and connect with GreenPill stewards" (Reflections)
  - "GreenPill Toronto event at Consensus conference" participation (Reflections)
- **Why it matters:** Accelerated learning and network building beyond local context

#### Community Currency Interest
**What emerged:** New focus on local economic systems
- **Evidence:** "Scott Morris workshop on community currencies...opened possibilities for developing a commitment pooling system for London" (Reflections)
- **Questions raised:** "What would it take to pilot an alternative economic system here in London, Ontario?" (Reflections)
- **Why it matters:** Expanded vision beyond governance to economic transformation

#### Ecosystem Warmth
**What emerged:** Unexpected welcome from global Web3 community
- **Evidence:** "**Warmth of web3 community**: The openness and welcoming nature of the broader web3 ecosystem exceeded expectations" (Reflections)
- **Why it matters:** Reduced barriers to entry and encouraged continued participation

#### Tool Discovery
**What emerged:** Finding cutting-edge tools for local experiments
- **Evidence:** "**AlloIRL tool discovery**: Found the brand new AlloIRL tool for conducting in-person quadratic funding experiments" (Reflections)
- **Why it matters:** Enables future experiments with lower technical barriers

#### Joint Initiatives
**What emerged:** Collaboration beyond original scope
- **Evidence:** "**Joint initiatives emerging**: The closer collaboration is sparking joint initiatives and projects beyond the original scope" (Reflections)
- **Why it matters:** Organic growth indicating genuine value creation

### Changes Not Yet Realized

#### Broader Volunteer Engagement
**Goal vs. Reality:**
- **Expected:** Increased volunteer agency through new systems
- **Actual:** "ICS volunteers haven't been engaged with the new systems in any significant way yet" (Reflections)
- **Timeline:** "integration into daily operations is still 6-18 months away" (Reflections)

#### Governance Impact on Operations
**Goal vs. Reality:**
- **Expected:** Decentralized decision-making
- **Actual:** "The new infrastructure hasn't yet touched everyday decision-making. Still in experimental phase" (Reflections)
- **Why it matters:** Honest acknowledgment of gap between infrastructure and implementation

## Summary of Evidence

The experiment produced significant quantitative achievements (4 active users, 4 GreenPill meetings, top 10% GG23 ranking, full technical infrastructure) while also generating important qualitative shifts (team ownership, shared language, strategic reorientation). Unexpected outcomes like conference invitations and community currency interest suggest ripple effects beyond planned activities. However, the evidence also honestly shows limited progress in broader volunteer engagement and operational governance changes, positioning this as a foundation-building phase rather than full transformation.
