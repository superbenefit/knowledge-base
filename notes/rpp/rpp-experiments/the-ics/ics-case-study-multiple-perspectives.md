# ICS Case Study - Step 1.3: Multiple Perspectives

## Multiple Stories

### Core Team (4 Members)

**Role in experiment:** Primary drivers and experimenters with the new governance tools and Web3 systems

**Engagement level:** Deeply involved - daily/weekly use of tools

**Evidence from documents:**
> "**Active users**: 4 people actively using these systems (exceeding goal of 3+)" (Reflections)
> "**Strengthened collaboration**: The experiment has fostered connection and co-creation among the 4 members actively involved" (Reflections)
> "**Shared language**: Team now has shared vocabulary and understanding around web3 governance concepts" (Reflections)
> "Within the core team of 4, everyone now feels some ownership of ICS" (Reflections)

**Their experience:**
- Excited by possibilities and actively building new practices
- Managing multiple stresses: "All 4 core team members were undergoing various stresses/transitions during the implementation period" (Reflections)
- Building shared understanding through hands-on experience
- Feeling increased ownership of ICS

**What they valued:**
- Autonomy to experiment
- Connection to global movement
- Practical tools for collaboration
- Shared decision-making power

**Response:** Positive but challenged by capacity constraints

### ICS Volunteers (Broader Base)

**Role in experiment:** Potential future users of governance systems, not yet engaged

**Engagement level:** Peripherally aware at best, mostly unengaged

**Evidence from documents:**
> "**Volunteer engagement with new systems**: No - ICS volunteers haven't been engaged with the new systems in any significant way yet" (Reflections)
> "Only the core team of 4 is using the new governance tools" (Reflections)
> "**Current limitation**: Benefits of decentralization remain within the small experimental group" (Reflections)
> Original challenge: "limits volunteer agency and community ownership" (Discovery Report)

**Their experience:**
- Largely unaware of the Web3 experiments
- Continue operating through traditional volunteer structures
- Haven't experienced the promised increase in agency yet

**What they valued:**
- Unknown - haven't been engaged enough to express preferences

**Response:** Not engaged enough to have a response

### GreenPill Participants

**Role in experiment:** Early adopters exploring regenerative finance locally

**Engagement level:** Consistent but small - same 4 people at each meeting

**Evidence from documents:**
> "✅ Four meetings held (March 23, March 30, April 10, June 9, 2025)" (Reflections)
> "**Attendance**: 4 people at each meeting" (Reflections)
> "Locals want to learn how to 'do'/participate in web3, not just learn theory" (Reflections)

**Their experience:**
- Seeking practical applications over theoretical knowledge
- Consistent attendance suggests genuine interest
- Small group allowing for intimate, deep discussions

**What they valued:**
- Hands-on learning opportunities
- Connection to global regenerative movement
- Practical local applications
- Regular meeting rhythm

**Response:** Positive - consistent attendance indicates satisfaction

### Broader London Community

**Role in experiment:** Target audience for Web3 adoption and participation

**Engagement level:** Minimal to none

**Evidence from documents:**
> "**Expected more local engagement**: Thought there would be more immediate engagement from Londoners with web3 initiatives, but the interest was lower than anticipated" (Reflections)
> "**Conservative innovation culture**: London tends to follow rather than lead trends, requiring proof of concept from elsewhere before local adoption" (Reflections)
> "**Earthfest booth**: Conversations were mostly high-level introductions to concepts rather than detailed feedback" (Reflections)

**Their experience:**
- Encountered Web3 concepts at events like Earthfest
- Skeptical or confused about value proposition
- Need to see proven benefits before engaging

**What they valued:**
- Tangible, immediate benefits
- Proven models from other communities
- Clear, jargon-free explanations

**Response:** Cautious skepticism, waiting for proof of value

### RPP/SuperBenefit Team

**Role in experiment:** Technical support, facilitation, and strategic guidance

**Engagement level:** Deeply involved in setup and support

**Evidence from documents:**
> "**Coordination between ICS and RPP** - ✅ NO CHALLENGES - Teams were fully aligned throughout" (Reflections)
> "RPP technical support and facilitation" listed as key resource (Reflections)
> Infrastructure success with "RPP's established templates and battle-tested procedures" (Reflections)

**Their experience:**
- Smooth collaboration with ICS team
- Successful technical implementation
- Validation of their support model

**What they valued:**
- Successful experiment outcomes
- Learning for broader RPP project
- Strong partner relationship

**Response:** Satisfied with progress and collaboration

### Global Networks (GreenPill Network, Gitcoin)

**Role in experiment:** Legitimizers and resource providers

**Evidence from documents:**
> "✅ Chapter application approved (February 2025)" (Reflections)
> "These stewards have indicated a willingness to vouch for ICS" (Scoping)
> "**Major success**: Achieved top 10% ranking in GG23 funding" (Reflections)
> "**Warmth of web3 community**: The openness and welcoming nature of the broader web3 ecosystem exceeded expectations" (Reflections)

**Their experience:**
- Welcoming to new local chapter
- Supportive through vouching and approval
- Validated ICS work through GG23 ranking

**What they valued:**
- Local expansion of movement
- Quality implementation
- Active participation in ecosystem

**Response:** Highly supportive and welcoming

### Funders (OTF)

**Role in experiment:** Primary funding source ($100,000 grant)

**Engagement level:** Arms-length oversight requiring reporting

**Evidence from documents:**
> "Reporting deadline for OTF (Ontario Trillium Foundation) grant - $100,000 grant which was majority funding for the project" (Reflections)
> "All promised deliverables completed" (Reflections)
> "**OTF Budget**: [TO BE COMPLETED - Not very much of the budget was spent]" (Reflections)

**Their perspective:**
- Deliverables met despite timeline adjustments
- Efficient use of resources (minimal spend)
- Foundation built for future impact

**What they valued:**
- Completed deliverables
- Responsible budget management
- Clear reporting

**Response:** Presumably satisfied (deliverables met)

### Conference/Event Participants

**Role in experiment:** Network builders and knowledge sharers

**Engagement level:** Episodic but impactful

**Evidence from documents:**
> "ETHDenver connections - Heenal had the opportunity to attend ETHDenver and connect with GreenPill stewards" (Reflections)
> "GreenPill Toronto event at Consensus conference" (Reflections)
> "Scott Morris workshop on community currencies" opened new possibilities (Reflections)

**Their experience:**
- Provided crucial connections and learning
- Opened unexpected opportunities
- Shared practical knowledge

**What they valued:**
- Growing the regenerative movement
- Supporting new initiatives
- Knowledge exchange

**Response:** Enthusiastically supportive

## Stakeholder Experience Summary

### Convergence Points
- All engaged stakeholders value practical application over theory
- Strong appreciation for connection to global movement
- Desire for tangible, demonstrable benefits

### Divergence Points
- **Engagement readiness**: Core team ready to dive deep vs. broader community needing proof first
- **Time horizons**: Core team thinking long-term vs. community wanting immediate benefits
- **Technical comfort**: Web3 natives comfortable with complexity vs. local community overwhelmed
- **Value perception**: Global networks see systemic change potential vs. locals see unnecessary complexity

### Key Insight
The experiment reveals a clear gradient of engagement: those closest to the work (core team, RPP, global networks) are enthusiastic and see transformative potential, while those further away (volunteers, broader community) remain skeptical or unaware. This suggests the need for careful bridging strategies to expand beyond the initial innovation circle.
