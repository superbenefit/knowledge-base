# ICS Case Study - Step 1.2: Connecting Threads

## Threads That Connect

### Theme 1: From Resource Focus to Participation Focus

**How it appears across phases:**

**Discovery Phase:**
> "What strategies can ICS adopt to diversify and stabilize its funding streams?" (Discovery Report)
> Initial framing centered on funding challenges and financial sustainability

**Scoping Phase:**
- Planned activities included "Minting Hypercerts" for retroactive funding
- Focus on "transparent and measurable impact" to attract donors
- Infrastructure setup aimed at "financial decision-making" (multisig wallet)

**Implementation/Reflection Phase:**
> "**Initial assumptions**: The team originally focused on impact attestations and bringing external web3 funding into the community
> **Evolved perspective**: Real interest lies in participation and agency - people want to be involved in decisions that affect them" (Reflections)

**Evolution:** Started as solving funding problems → Discovered people care more about having a voice → Shifted to enabling community participation

**Why it matters:** This fundamental reorientation from "bringing resources in" to "enabling participation" represents the experiment's most significant philosophical shift and likely determines its long-term success.

### Theme 2: Learning by Doing Over Theoretical Education

**How it appears across phases:**

**Discovery Phase:**
> "Host accessible and interactive in-person events, where participants can learn about blockchain and ReFi in a welcoming environment" (Discovery Report)
> "Provide hands-on experiences with web3 tools, such as creating wallets and minting NFTs" (Discovery Report)

**Scoping Phase:**
- Planned "structured onboarding workshop" with "guides, presentations, and interactive exercises"
- Focus on "Web3 Tools Training" as formal education

**Implementation/Reflection Phase:**
> "**Community feedback**: Locals want to learn how to 'do'/participate in web3, not just learn theory" (Reflections)
> "**Goal**: Showcase through simultaneous learning and doing how web3 tools enable local social impact" (Reflections)
> Workshop evolution: "Moving from single workshop to 8-week learning cohort that combines education with hands-on experience" (Reflections)

**Evolution:** Formal workshop approach → Community pushback → Shift to experiential learning → 8-week cohort combining both

**Why it matters:** This theme reveals how community preferences shaped the approach, demonstrating that Web3 adoption requires practical application rather than abstract education.

### Theme 3: Opportunistic Flexibility Over Rigid Planning

**How it appears across phases:**

**Discovery Phase:**
Multiple structured interventions proposed:
1. "Governance Experiment"
2. "Hypercert Pilot" 
3. "Community Engagement"
4. "Quadratic Funding Test"
5. "Off-Ramping Proof-of-Concept"

**Scoping Phase:**
Specific milestones with dates:
- "Governance setup completion by February 2025"
- "Green Pill Network local chapter kickoff by March 2025"
- "Hypercert minted by March 2025"

**Implementation/Reflection Phase:**
> "**Key insight**: The timeline had to respond to circumstances and team capacity rather than forcing a predetermined sequence and timing of events
> This flexible approach led to better outcomes (e.g., GG23 success, stronger network connections)" (Reflections)

> "Responded fluidly, working with emergence rather than forcing predetermined plans" (Reflections)

**Unexpected opportunities seized:**
- GG23 participation (not in original plan)
- ETHDenver attendance
- Consensus Toronto event
- Scott Morris workshop "organized at short notice"

**Evolution:** Detailed planning → Reality of opportunities → Embracing emergence → Better outcomes than planned

**Why it matters:** This pattern suggests that successful Web3 adoption at local levels requires adaptability and readiness to seize opportunities rather than rigid adherence to plans.

### Theme 4: Small Core Team as Innovation Lab

**How it appears across phases:**

**Discovery Phase:**
> "The governance structure of ICS is currently centralized, with high-level decisions made by a core team" (Discovery Report)
Challenge: "limits volunteer agency and community ownership"

**Scoping Phase:**
Success metric: "Governance systems are operational, with at least three active ICS participants onboarded"
Modest goal suggesting small-scale start

**Implementation/Reflection Phase:**
> "**Active users**: 4 people actively using these systems (exceeding goal of 3+)" (Reflections)
> "**Attendance**: 4 people at each meeting" (GreenPill meetings) (Reflections)
> "Only the core team of 4 is using the new governance tools" (Reflections)
> "Within the core team of 4, everyone now feels some ownership of ICS" (Reflections)

**Evolution:** Centralized challenge → Small team experimentation → Strong bonds within 4 → Foundation for future expansion

**Why it matters:** This pattern validates the approach of testing innovations with a committed small group before attempting broader rollout - building deep understanding before wide adoption.

### Theme 5: Communication Barriers as Persistent Challenge

**How it appears across phases:**

**Discovery Phase:**
> "Develop clear, jargon-free educational materials tailored to non-technical audiences" (Discovery Report)
Already recognized as crucial need

**Scoping Phase:**
- "Web3 Tools Training" planned
- "structured onboarding workshop tailored to participants' varying familiarity with Web3"
- Focus on making tools accessible

**Implementation/Reflection Phase:**
> "**Explaining web3 to non-technical audiences**: Major challenge in finding effective ways to communicate web3 concepts to 'normies'" (Reflections)
> "**Communication is key**: 'Plan out how to communicate - and demonstrate - the value of how you're using web3, in a way that just makes sense to people'" (Reflections)
> "Still struggling to effectively communicate web3 value to mainstream audiences" (Reflections)

**Evolution:** Recognized early → Planned for → Still struggled with → Remains unsolved but central

**Why it matters:** This persistent challenge across all phases highlights that bridging the Web3/mainstream gap is perhaps the fundamental obstacle to local adoption, requiring continued innovation.

### Theme 6: Local Node in Global Movement

**How it appears across phases:**

**Discovery Phase:**
> "establishes its role as a local node in the decentralized regenerative web3 ecosystem" (Discovery Report)
> "ICS intends to become part of a decentralized network of community hubs" (Discovery Report)
> "Creating a local node of the global regenerative movement" (section title)

**Scoping Phase:**
- "Launching a Green Pill Network Local Chapter" as key activity
- "applying for official recognition" from global network
- Integration with "SuperBenefit's on-chain accounting system"

**Implementation/Reflection Phase:**
- GreenPill chapter approved by global network
- Participation in ETHDenver and Consensus Toronto
- GG23 participation connecting to global Gitcoin community
- "London joining a global movement for positive change" (Reflections)

**Evolution:** Vision of connection → Formal applications → Active participation → Recognized member of global networks

**Why it matters:** This theme shows how local experimentation gains legitimacy and resources through connection to global movements, while maintaining local autonomy and focus.

## Summary of Connecting Threads

These six themes reveal the underlying dynamics of how change happened at ICS:

1. **Participation over resources** - The fundamental shift from viewing Web3 as a funding mechanism to seeing it as enabling community agency
2. **Learning by doing** - Community preference for hands-on experience over theoretical education shaped the entire approach
3. **Opportunistic flexibility** - Success came from responding to emergent opportunities rather than following rigid plans
4. **Small team experimentation** - Testing governance innovations with 4 committed people created a strong foundation for future expansion
5. **Communication challenges** - The persistent difficulty of explaining Web3 value to mainstream audiences remains the central obstacle
6. **Local-global connection** - Legitimacy and resources flow from global network membership while maintaining local focus

These threads weave together to tell a story of patient, adaptive experimentation that prioritizes genuine participation over quick wins, suggesting a model for other communities attempting similar transformations.
