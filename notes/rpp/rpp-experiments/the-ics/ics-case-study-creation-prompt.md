I need help creating a case study for the Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) experiment as part of the Reimagining Power Project. This experiment involved a London, Ontario nonprofit testing Web3 governance tools with surprising results—they discovered communities want participation and voice, not just new funding mechanisms. 

I want you to create a simple execution sequence with links to all possible useful reference materials. Use the case study synthesis workflow to construct a sequence of steps to complete the case study synthesis workflow to produce a case study for ICS.

Your Task 1. **First, thoroughly study all materials** in these directories: * Primary: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-experiments\the-ics` * Additional context: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\ics` * Synthesis workflow: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\tools\workflows\artifacts\case-studies\synthesis` (and parent directory) 2. **Then create an execution strategy** for human+AI collaboration that: * Maps out clear phases with human decision points * Identifies where human insight is most valuable vs. where AI can accelerate * Suggests how to maintain narrative coherence across sessions * Includes quality checkpoints Key Insights to Apply * The real story is often in the gap between intention and reality (only 4 people use the infrastructure, but that's the success) * Honest complexity makes success more credible (include the "we sidestepped community engagement LOL" moments) * Communities experience Web3 differently than builders expect—center their perspective * The narrative arc should be "assumption → experiment → discovery → more questions" not "problem → solution" * Show, don't tell: demonstrate insights through specific moments and quotes * The participation vs. resources revelation is the heart of this story Deliverable Provide a detailed strategy document that: 1. Summarizes key findings from the materials 2. Proposes a phased approach with clear human touchpoints 3. Identifies the most compelling narrative threads 4. Suggests how to handle the multiple audiences (funders, practitioners, researchers, communities) 5. Recommends specific techniques for maintaining authenticity while serving organizational needs Focus on creating a practical roadmap that leverages both human judgment and AI capabilities efficiently.  

Do not include project planning or management language. do not include timelines. Each phase of the strategy should correspond to a phase of the case study synthesis workflow. Include prompts to execute each step in Claude, including any links (formatted to work correctly the first time when using the obsidian_mcp_tools MCP server), and well-considered instructions which properly use advanced Claude features like extended thinking where appropriate.

In your output, each heading should be followed by at least 1 paragraph of natural-english text. It's good to use bullet points, but they shouldn't be the foundation of the content.
