## Process Steps

### Step 1: Extract Key Elements Using Synthesis Worksheet

We begin by mining the three core documents for the essential elements that will form our case study. The synthesis worksheet provides a framework for this extraction, helping us identify the narrative threads that run through the entire experiment. This step is about gathering raw materials - the facts, quotes, metrics, and insights that will eventually be woven into a compelling story.

**Primary Tool**: [`F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\tools\workflows\artifacts\case-studies\synthesis\synthesis-worksheet.md`](F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\tools\workflows\artifacts\case-studies\synthesis\synthesis-worksheet.md)

**How to use it**: Open the worksheet and work through each section, using it as a thinking guide rather than a form to fill out. The worksheet prompts you to explore different dimensions of the experiment - from the narrative arc to resource usage. Copy relevant excerpts from the source documents into each section, noting which document they came from for later reference.

**Source Documents to Review**:
- [`ICS Discovery Report`](F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-experiments\the-ics\ICS Discovery Report.md) - For original context and challenges
- [`ICS Experiment Scoping`](F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-experiments\the-ics\ICS Experiment Scoping.md) - For planned activities and success metrics  
- [`ICS Experiment Reflections`](F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-experiments\the-ics\ICS Experiment Reflections.md) - For what actually happened and lessons learned

**AI Prompt Chain Instructions**: Work through each sub-section (1.1-1.8) sequentially. For each section, use the corresponding prompt below with the source documents. Copy the extracted information into a working document, building your synthesis worksheet progressively.

#### 1.1 Journey Arc

First, we map the complete journey from beginning to current state. This helps establish the narrative backbone of our case study - where ICS started, what catalyzed change, how the experiment unfolded, and where they've arrived. This arc provides readers with orientation and helps them understand the transformation in context.

**AI Prompt for Journey Arc Extraction**:
```
<thinking>
The user wants me to extract the journey arc from the ICS experiment documents. I need to identify:
1. Starting point - from Discovery Report
2. Catalyst - what sparked the change
3. Key milestones - major events in chronological order
4. Evolution - how plans changed from original scope
5. Ending point - current state from Reflections

I should look for specific details, dates, and concrete examples rather than generalizations.
</thinking>

I need to extract the complete journey arc for the ICS experiment case study. Please analyze these three documents to identify the narrative timeline:

[Paste Discovery Report content]
[Paste Experiment Scoping content] 
[Paste Experiment Reflections content]

Extract and organize:
1. **Starting point**: What was ICS's situation before the experiment? Include specific organizational challenges, governance issues, and context.
2. **Catalyst**: What triggered this experiment? Include funding details, key opportunities, and motivating factors.
3. **Key milestones**: List major events chronologically with dates. Include both planned and emergent activities.
4. **Evolution**: How did the experiment change from original plans? Note pivots, adaptations, and unexpected developments.
5. **Ending point**: Where is ICS now compared to expectations? Include current capabilities, ongoing work, and foundation built.

For each element, provide specific evidence from the documents including quotes, metrics, and concrete examples. Note which document each piece of information comes from.
```

**Starting Point**: 
- ICS as a centralized nonprofit with governance bottlenecks
- Strong volunteer base but limited agency
- Need to scale impact and diversify funding

**Catalyst**: 
- RPP opportunity with $100,000 OTF funding
- Alignment with regenerative finance movement
- Vision to become a local ReFi node

**Key Milestones**:
- Governance infrastructure setup (Jan-Feb 2025)
- GreenPill chapter approval (Feb 2025)
- Four GreenPill meetings (Mar-Jun 2025)
- GG23 top 10% ranking achievement
- ETHDenver and Consensus Toronto connections

**Evolution**: 
- Shifted from traditional hypercerts to Karma GAP
- Expanded from one to four GreenPill meetings
- Pivoted from single workshop to 8-week cohort model

**Ending Point**: 
- Core team of 4 actively using Web3 tools
- GreenPill London established but still nascent
- Foundation laid for future community adoption

#### 1.2 Connecting Threads

Next, we identify the themes that appear repeatedly across all phases of the experiment. These connecting threads reveal deeper patterns about how change happens and what matters most. They help us move beyond a simple chronological account to understand the underlying dynamics of transformation.

**AI Prompt for Connecting Threads**:
```
<thinking>
Now I need to identify recurring themes across all three phases. I should look for:
- Concepts that appear in Discovery and evolve through Implementation
- Patterns that persist across the journey
- Underlying dynamics that explain how change happened
- Themes that connect different activities or outcomes
</thinking>

Now I need to identify the connecting threads that run through the entire ICS experiment. Using the same three documents:

Analyze for recurring themes by:
1. **Tracking concepts** that appear in Discovery and evolve through Implementation to Reflection
2. **Identifying patterns** that persist across all phases (governance, funding, community engagement, etc.)
3. **Finding underlying dynamics** that explain HOW change happened, not just what changed
4. **Connecting disparate elements** - how do different activities relate to each other?

For each theme identified:
- Show how it appears in each phase with specific examples
- Explain how it evolved or transformed
- Note why it matters to the overall story
- Include supporting quotes or evidence

Focus on 4-6 major themes that truly connect the journey rather than listing every topic mentioned.
```

- **Participation over resources**: Evolution from viewing Web3 as funding mechanism to enabling community agency
- **Learning by doing**: Community preference for hands-on experience over theoretical education
- **Opportunistic flexibility**: Success through responding to emergent opportunities rather than rigid planning
- **Small team experimentation**: Testing governance innovations with core group before broader rollout

#### 1.3 Multiple Perspectives

Every experiment is experienced differently by different participants. Here we capture how various stakeholder groups - from the core team to the broader community - perceived and engaged with the changes. These diverse viewpoints add richness and authenticity to our narrative.

**AI Prompt for Multiple Perspectives**:
```
<thinking>
I need to extract different stakeholder perspectives from the documents. I should look for:
- Direct quotes or reported feedback
- Different levels of engagement
- Varying responses to the changes
- Conflicts or alignments between groups
</thinking>

Extract the multiple stakeholder perspectives from the ICS experiment. From the three documents, identify:

1. **Stakeholder groups** involved (core team, volunteers, community members, partners, funders, etc.)
2. **Their unique experiences** - How did each group engage with or perceive the experiment?
3. **Direct voices** - Find any quotes, feedback, or reported responses from different groups
4. **Engagement levels** - Who was deeply involved vs. peripherally aware?
5. **Divergent views** - Where did perspectives differ? What mattered to different groups?

For each stakeholder group, provide:
- Their role in the experiment
- Their level of engagement/awareness
- Their response to the changes (positive, negative, mixed)
- Specific examples or quotes showing their perspective
- What they valued or prioritized

Create a multi-dimensional view that shows how the same experiment was experienced differently by different participants.
```

- **Core team (4 members)**: Excited by possibilities, building shared language and practices
- **ICS volunteers**: Not yet engaged with new systems
- **GreenPill participants**: Consistent small group seeking practical applications
- **Broader community**: Still largely unaware or skeptical of Web3 value

#### 1.4 Evidence of Change

Documentation without evidence is just storytelling. In this section, we gather concrete proof of transformation - both the numbers that satisfy funders and the human stories that inspire practitioners. We look for measurable shifts as well as qualitative changes in culture, relationships, and capabilities.

**AI Prompt for Evidence of Change**:
```
<thinking>
I need to find concrete evidence of what changed - both quantitative metrics and qualitative shifts. I should look for:
- Before/after comparisons
- Specific metrics achieved vs. goals
- Stories of transformation
- System or culture changes
- Unexpected outcomes
</thinking>

Extract concrete evidence of change from the ICS experiment. Analyze the documents for:

**Quantitative Evidence:**
- Specific metrics with before/after numbers
- Goals vs. actual achievements
- Participation rates, attendance figures
- Financial or resource metrics
- Technical milestones completed

**Qualitative Evidence:**
- Stories of individual or group transformation
- Shifts in culture, behavior, or relationships
- New capabilities or capacities developed
- Changes in understanding or awareness
- System or process improvements

**Unexpected Outcomes:**
- Unplanned positive results
- Emergent benefits
- Ripple effects

For each piece of evidence:
- State what specifically changed
- Provide the concrete evidence (number, quote, example)
- Note the source document and context
- Explain why this change matters

Create a balanced view that includes both impressive achievements and modest progress, both numbers and human stories.
```

**Quantitative**:
- 4 active governance tool users (exceeding goal of 3)
- 4 GreenPill meetings held (exceeding goal of 1)
- Top 10% GG23 ranking
- Governance infrastructure fully operational

**Qualitative**:
- Increased Web3 awareness among participants
- Stronger collaboration within core team
- Emerging joint initiatives beyond original scope
- Shift in understanding from funding to participation focus

#### 1.5 Honest Complexity

Real transformation is messy, and credible case studies acknowledge this. We document what didn't work, where plans had to change, and what challenges remain unresolved. This transparency makes our successes more believable and our learnings more valuable to others.

**AI Prompt for Honest Complexity**:
```
<thinking>
I need to extract the challenges, failures, and ongoing tensions from the experiment. This includes:
- What didn't work as planned
- Obstacles encountered
- Compromises made
- Unresolved issues
- Lessons from failures
</thinking>

Identify the honest complexity and challenges from the ICS experiment. From the documents, extract:

1. **Failed attempts** - What was tried but didn't work? Include specific examples.
2. **Major obstacles** - What barriers did they encounter? How did these impact progress?
3. **Pivots and adaptations** - When did plans have to change? Why?
4. **Ongoing tensions** - What remains unresolved or challenging?
5. **Capacity constraints** - Where were resources insufficient?
6. **Communication challenges** - Where did understanding break down?

For each challenge:
- Describe what happened specifically
- Explain the impact on the experiment
- Note how they responded (if at all)
- Identify what remains difficult
- Extract any lessons learned

Be thorough in documenting struggles - this honesty makes the successes more credible and helps others prepare for similar challenges. Include direct quotes about difficulties where available.
```

- **Communication barriers**: Harder than expected to explain Web3 value to mainstream audiences
- **Limited reach**: Only engaged core team, not broader volunteer base
- **Timeline disruptions**: Opportunities (conferences, GG23) delayed other progress
- **Capacity constraints**: All team members facing personal transitions

#### 1.6 Transferable Insights

From the specific experience of ICS, we extract principles and patterns that others can adapt to their own contexts. These aren't prescriptions but rather wisdom gained through practice - the kind of insights that help others navigate similar journeys more skillfully.

**AI Prompt for Transferable Insights**:
```
<thinking>
I need to extract insights that go beyond ICS's specific context - principles and patterns that others could adapt. I should look for:
- Lessons that apply broadly
- Principles rather than prescriptions
- Success factors
- Warning signs
- Adaptation strategies
</thinking>

Extract transferable insights from the ICS experiment that others can adapt. From the documents, identify:

1. **Universal principles** - What lessons apply regardless of context?
2. **Success factors** - What elements were essential for progress?
3. **Warning signs** - What should others watch out for?
4. **Adaptation strategies** - How can approaches be modified for different contexts?
5. **Prerequisites** - What foundations need to be in place?

For each insight:
- State the principle clearly and concisely
- Provide evidence from ICS's experience
- Explain why this matters universally
- Suggest how others might apply it
- Note any contextual considerations

Focus on 5-8 major insights that offer genuine value to others attempting similar work. These should be wisdom gained through practice, not theoretical advice.
```

- Patience is prerequisite for Web3 adoption
- Fun and enjoyment essential for sustaining momentum
- Communication strategy crucial from start
- Small experiments inform larger transformations
- Flexibility enables better outcomes than rigid planning

#### 1.7 Resources Used

Transparency about resources helps others assess whether similar approaches might work for them. We document not just the financial investment but also the human energy, time, and external support that made the experiment possible.

**AI Prompt for Resource Documentation**:
```
<thinking>
I need to document all resources used - financial, human, time, and external support. This includes:
- Actual vs. planned resource use
- Sources of support
- Critical vs. nice-to-have resources
- Resource efficiency insights
</thinking>

Document all resources used in the ICS experiment. From the documents, extract:

1. **Financial resources**
   - Budget allocated vs. spent
   - Funding sources
   - Cost breakdowns if available

2. **Human resources**
   - Staff/volunteer time invested
   - Key roles and contributions
   - Expertise required

3. **Time investment**
   - Duration of experiment
   - Time allocation across activities
   - Preparation vs. implementation time

4. **External support**
   - Technical assistance received
   - Partner contributions
   - Network resources accessed

5. **Resource efficiency**
   - What provided most value?
   - Where could resources be reduced?
   - Critical vs. optional investments

For each category, note:
- Planned vs. actual usage
- Source of the resource
- How it was deployed
- Impact on outcomes

This transparency helps others plan realistic resource allocations for similar work.
```

- OTF grant funding (minimal spend to date)
- Hundreds of volunteer hours
- RPP technical support and facilitation
- Conference attendance (ETHDenver, Consensus)
- Workshop facilitation (Scott Morris on community currencies)

#### 1.8 Living Questions

Good experiments raise as many questions as they answer. We capture the uncertainties that emerged, the new areas of curiosity, and the questions that will guide future work. This positions the case study as part of an ongoing journey rather than a finished story.

**AI Prompt for Living Questions**:
```
<thinking>
I need to identify the questions that emerged from the experiment - both answered and unanswered. This includes:
- New questions raised
- Ongoing uncertainties
- Future exploration areas
- Research needs
- Strategic questions
</thinking>

Extract the living questions from the ICS experiment. From the documents, identify:

1. **Ongoing uncertainties** - What remains unknown or unclear?
2. **Emergent questions** - What new questions arose from the experience?
3. **Future exploration** - What areas deserve deeper investigation?
4. **Strategic questions** - What big decisions remain?
5. **Research needs** - What would benefit from systematic study?

For each question:
- State it clearly and specifically
- Explain why it emerged from this experiment
- Note why it matters for future work
- Suggest who might explore it
- Connect to broader sector questions if relevant

Include 5-10 significant questions that show the experiment as part of ongoing learning rather than a completed project. These questions should inspire continued exploration.
```

- What would it take to pilot an alternative economic system in London?
- How can Web3 serve the most disadvantaged?
- How to make tools accessible to non-technical users?
- What's the minimum viable community for sustainable adoption?
- How to balance innovation with accessibility?

### Step 2: Structure the Narrative

With our raw materials gathered, we now shape them into a coherent story. This is where we make strategic decisions about what to emphasize, how to sequence information, and which elements will best serve our various audiences. We're creating an architecture that will guide readers through the transformation journey in a way that's both engaging and informative.

**Key Resource**: Review the completed synthesis worksheet sections to identify:
- The most compelling transformation moment (for your opening hook)
- The logical flow from challenge through intervention to outcomes
- Which stakeholder perspectives to highlight
- What evidence best supports your key claims

**AI Prompt for Narrative Structure**:
```
<thinking>
The user needs help structuring the narrative from the extracted elements. I should help them:
1. Identify the most compelling hook
2. Create a logical flow
3. Balance different elements
4. Serve multiple audiences
5. Maintain narrative coherence
</thinking>

I have extracted key elements from the ICS experiment documents. Now help me structure these into a compelling narrative for the case study. Here are my extracted elements:

[Paste your completed worksheet sections 1.1-1.8]

Please analyze these elements and recommend:

1. **Opening Hook** - What's the most surprising or compelling transformation to lead with?
2. **Narrative Flow** - What sequence best serves the story? 
3. **Emphasis Points** - Which elements deserve the most attention?
4. **Audience Balance** - How to serve funders, practitioners, and researchers?
5. **Supporting Evidence** - Which data/quotes best support key claims?
6. **Complexity Integration** - Where to weave in challenges without undermining success?

Create a detailed outline showing:
- Executive summary focus (3-4 key points)
- Background elements to include (contextualize without overwhelming)
- Transformation story structure (phases or themes?)
- Which outcomes to highlight
- How to frame the lessons learned

Ensure the structure maintains narrative coherence while serving multiple stakeholder needs.
```

**Narrative Structure Guide**: The case study will follow this arc:
1. **Hook with transformation** - Start with the most surprising or significant outcome
2. **Establish context** - Brief background on ICS and the challenges they faced
3. **Show the journey** - How they moved from problem to solution
4. **Demonstrate impact** - Evidence of what changed
5. **Extract learnings** - What others can take from this experience

**Executive Summary Focus**:
- Lead with GG23 success and GreenPill chapter establishment
- Frame as foundation-building for community transformation
- Highlight shift from resource to participation focus

**Background Elements**:
- ICS's unique position as established nonprofit exploring Web3
- London's conservative innovation culture
- RPP as catalyst for experimentation

**Transformation Story Arc**:
- Phase 1: Infrastructure Building (Jan-Mar 2025)

- Phase 3: Learning and Adaptation (May-Jul 2025)

**Key Outcomes to Highlight**:
- Governance infrastructure operational
- GreenPill London established
- GG23 success demonstrating community support
- Foundation for future Web3 adoption

**Lessons to Emphasize**:
- Importance of patient, joy-centered approach
- Value of small-scale experimentation
- Need for clear communication strategies
- Benefits of flexible, opportunistic planning

### Step 3: Write the Case Study

This is where synthesis truly happens - transforming our structured elements into a flowing narrative that serves multiple purposes. We'll use the synthesis template as our guide, but allow the unique story of ICS to shape how we fill it. The writing should balance comprehensive documentation with readability, creating something that's both thorough and engaging.

**Primary Tool**: [`F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\tools\workflows\artifacts\case-studies\synthesis\synthesis-template.md`](F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\tools\workflows\artifacts\case-studies\synthesis\synthesis-template.md)

**How to use it**: Copy the template to create your case study file. The template provides:
- Structured sections with guidance on what to include
- Prompts for the type of content each section needs
- Frontmatter fields for metadata and searchability
- Flexible structure that can be adapted to your story

**AI Assistance**: [`F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\tools\workflows\artifacts\case-studies\synthesis\synthesis-workflow.md`](F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\tools\workflows\artifacts\case-studies\synthesis\synthesis-workflow.md)

**How to use it**: The workflow provides specific AI prompts for each section. Copy these prompts and insert your extracted content from the worksheet to generate initial drafts. The prompts are designed to maintain narrative flow while incorporating multiple perspectives and evidence.

**AI Prompts for Each Section**:

- Sets up the transformation story without giving it away

Include specific examples and avoid generic descriptions. Make readers care about ICS's journey.
```

**Transformation Story Prompt**:
```
<thinking>
The transformation story is the heart of the case study. It needs to:
- Show the journey through phases
- Include multiple voices
- Balance successes and challenges
- Maintain narrative tension
- Use specific examples
</thinking>

Create the transformation story section using the three-phase structure:

Phase 1 - Infrastructure Building: [paste relevant milestones and activities from Jan-Mar]
Phase 2 - Community Activation: [paste GreenPill meetings, GG23 campaign from Mar-May]
Phase 3 - Learning and Adaptation: [paste conference participation, pivots from May-Jul]

For each phase, write 500 words that:
- Opens with what they set out to do
- Shows what actually happened with specific examples
- Includes stakeholder perspectives (use any quotes available)
- Acknowledges challenges faced
- Highlights turning points or surprises
- Connects to the next phase

Weave in:
- The pivot from hypercerts to Karma GAP
- The expansion from 1 to 4 GreenPill meetings
- The workshop evolution to cohort model
- Team capacity challenges
- Unexpected opportunities (conferences, GG23)

Make it feel like a real journey with ups and downs, not a predetermined success.
```

**Outcomes and Reflections Prompt**:
```
<thinking>
This section needs to:
- Present evidence of change
- Share honest learnings
- Include critical reflection
- Balance quantitative and qualitative
- Set up transferable insights
</thinking>

Develop the Outcomes and Reflections section with three subsections:

What Changed: [paste evidence from worksheet 1.4]

Focus on creating value for practitioners seeking to adapt these approaches.
```

Using the synthesis template structure:
1. Craft compelling executive summary
2. Develop rich background and context
3. Document approach and methodology
4. Tell transformation story through three phases
5. Present balanced outcomes and reflections
6. Extract patterns and future directions

### Step 4: Quality Review

Before finalizing, we step back to assess whether our case study achieves its multiple purposes. This review ensures we're serving all stakeholders - from funders who need evidence of impact to practitioners seeking guidance. We check for narrative flow, evidence strength, and the balance between success stories and honest complexity.

**Review Tool**: Use the quality review prompts from [`synthesis-workflow.md`](F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\tools\workflows\artifacts\case-studies\synthesis\synthesis-workflow.md) (Step 6)

**How to use it**: The workflow provides four specific review prompts:
1. **Narrative Coherence** - Check story arc and flow
2. **Multi-Stakeholder Value** - Ensure all audiences are served
3. **Pattern Quality** - Verify transferable insights are clear
4. **Visual Enhancement** - Identify where diagrams would help

**Quality Review AI Prompts**:

**Narrative Coherence Review**:
```
<thinking>
I need to review the case study for:
- Complete story arc

- Respectful representation?

Identify gaps for each audience and suggest specific improvements.
```

Run your draft through each prompt to identify areas for improvement. Pay special attention to:
- Whether someone unfamiliar with Web3 could understand the value
- If practitioners have enough detail to adapt the approaches
- Whether funders can clearly see return on investment
- If the challenges are presented honestly without undermining successes

Review for:
- **Narrative coherence**: Clear arc from challenge to current state
- **Multi-stakeholder value**: Serves funders, practitioners, researchers
- **Evidence strength**: Concrete examples support claims
- **Honest complexity**: Acknowledges challenges alongside successes
- **Transferable insights**: Others can learn and adapt

### Step 5: Final Polish

The last step transforms a good case study into an excellent one. We add visual elements that clarify complex information, ensure the language is accessible to all audiences, and create clear connections to the broader movement. This is about making the document not just informative but inspiring - something that motivates others to experiment and learn.

**Final Polish AI Prompts**:

**Language Accessibility Review**:
```
<thinking>
I need to check for:
- Jargon and technical terms
- Reading level
- Clarity of explanations
- Concrete examples
</thinking>

Review this case study for language accessibility:
