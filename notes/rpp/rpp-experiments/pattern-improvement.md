# Pattern Improvement Strategy: SuperBenefit Reimagining Power Project

## Project Context and Purpose

### About the Reimagining Power Project

The Reimagining Power Project (RPP) is SuperBenefit's initiative to explore how Web3 technologies can redistribute power and transform systems in social impact organizations. Through partnerships with organizations like All In For Sport (AIFS), Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS), and Equality Fund, the project has conducted real-world experiments in decentralized governance, transparent funding mechanisms, and community-driven coordination.

### Why Pattern Documentation Matters

Patterns are reusable solutions to common challenges in decentralized organization design. They serve as a bridge between high-level principles and on-the-ground implementation, helping organizations avoid common pitfalls and build on proven approaches. Well-documented patterns:

- Enable organizations to learn from each other's experiences
- Reduce the time and risk involved in implementing new governance models
- Create a shared vocabulary for discussing organizational design
- Build collective intelligence about what works in different contexts

### The Current Challenge

The RPP experiments have implemented sophisticated governance patterns that go beyond what's currently documented in SuperBenefit's knowledge base. Case studies reference patterns like "Coordi-nations" and "Gatherings" extensively, but these patterns either lack formal documentation or exist only in working documents rather than the proper patterns library. Additionally, case studies sometimes reference concepts that aren't actually patterns in the SuperBenefit framework, creating confusion about what constitutes a pattern versus a methodology or framework. This gap makes it difficult to:

- Link confidently from the RPP playbook to supporting pattern documentation
- Help other organizations implement similar approaches
- Build on the learnings from these experiments
- Maintain consistency in how patterns are described and understood
- Distinguish between actual SuperBenefit patterns and other concepts

### Purpose of This Strategy

This strategy provides a systematic approach to:

1. Identify all patterns used in RPP experiments
2. Align case study references with actual SuperBenefit patterns
3. Document missing patterns using established workflows
4. Enhance and relocate patterns that exist in working documents
5. Update existing patterns with RPP examples
6. Standardize terminology and relationships
7. Prepare the pattern library for playbook integration

The strategy is designed to be executed in phases, with each phase potentially happening in a different Claude chat session. No assumptions are made about timelines or resources.

## Phase 1: Research and Preparation

Phase 1 is COMPLETE. See [[phase-1-pattern-research-summary]] for output

### Context for Phase 1

This phase establishes the foundation for all pattern improvement work. It involves comprehensive research to understand what patterns are being used, how they're documented, and what gaps exist. Importantly, this includes checking both the official patterns folder and working documents where patterns may be in development. This research will inform all subsequent phases.

### Step 1.1: Gather Core Documentation

**Purpose**: Collect all relevant RPP documentation to understand the full scope of pattern usage across experiments.

```
I'm beginning work on improving pattern documentation for the SuperBenefit Reimagining Power Project. I need to gather and review all core documentation. Please help me:

1. Using obsidian-mcp-tools, retrieve the following case study documents:
   - get_vault_file({filename: "notes/rpp/rpp-experiments/all-in-for-sport/aifs-case-study-draft.md"})
   - get_vault_file({filename: "notes/rpp/rpp-experiments/the-ics/ICS-Experiment-Case-Study.md"})
   - get_vault_file({filename: "notes/rpp/rpp-experiments/equality-fund/rpp-equality-fund-case-study-draft.md"})

2. Retrieve associated discovery and intervention documents:
   - search_vault_simple({query: "discovery report", contextLength: 200})
   - search_vault_simple({query: "intervention mapping", contextLength: 200})
   - search_vault_simple({query: "experiment scoping", contextLength: 200})

3. Get the playbook context document:
   - get_vault_file({filename: "notes/rpp/Playbook Reflections & Context.md"})

4. Create a summary of what documentation exists for each experiment and what key patterns are mentioned.
```

### Step 1.2: Analyze Pattern Usage

**Purpose**: Create a comprehensive inventory of all patterns mentioned or implied in the RPP documentation, understanding how they're used in context.

```
Now I need to analyze pattern usage across the RPP documentation. Please:

1. For each case study and experiment document found, identify:
   - Explicitly named patterns (e.g., "we implemented the X pattern")
   - Implicitly used patterns (approaches that could be formalized as patterns)
   - Pattern-related terminology and variations

2. Create a comprehensive list organized by experiment showing:
   - Pattern name (standardized)
   - How it's referenced in the document
   - Context of usage
   - Implementation details provided
   - Outcomes or learnings mentioned

3. Note any patterns that appear across multiple experiments

4. Identify patterns that are core to the playbook concepts listed in the context document:
   - Coordi-nations
   - Peer to peer payments
   - DAOs, cells, roles, tasks
   - Local nodes
   - Token based governance
   - Group state
```

### Step 1.3: Audit Existing Pattern Documentation

**Purpose**: Understand what pattern documentation already exists and assess its quality and completeness. This includes checking both the official patterns folder and working documents where patterns might be in development.

```
I need to audit the existing pattern documentation in the knowledge base. Please:

1. List all files in the patterns artifact folder:
   list_vault_files({directory: "artifacts/patterns"})

2. For each pattern file found:
   - Retrieve and analyze its content
   - Check if it follows the current template structure
   - Note completeness of sections
   - Identify if RPP experiments are referenced

3. Check the DAO Primitives patterns folder:
   list_vault_files({directory: "notes/dao-primitives/implementation/patterns"})

4. IMPORTANT - Search for patterns in the RPP working documents:
   list_vault_files({directory: "notes/rpp/rpp-working-docs"})
   - Some patterns may exist here but not be in the proper location
   - Note which ones need to be moved to artifacts/patterns/

5. For any patterns found in working docs:
   - Retrieve and assess their completeness
   - Note what enhancements are needed
   - Identify if they're ready to move to the official folder

6. Create a status report showing:
   - Which RPP-referenced patterns have documentation (and where)
   - Quality/completeness of existing documentation
   - Which patterns are completely missing
   - Which patterns exist but need enhancement/relocation
```

### Step 1.4: Understand Pattern Workflows

**Purpose**: Familiarize yourself with the established workflows for creating and updating patterns to ensure consistency.

```
I need to understand the pattern documentation workflows. Please:

1. Retrieve and analyze the pattern workflows:
   - get_vault_file({filename: "tools/workflows/artifacts/patterns/pattern-creation.md"})
   - get_vault_file({filename: "tools/workflows/artifacts/patterns/pattern-update.md"})
   - get_vault_file({filename: "tools/workflows/artifacts/patterns/readme.md"})

2. Get the pattern template and type definition:
   - get_vault_file({filename: "tools/templates/pattern.md"})
   - get_vault_file({filename: "tools/types/pattern.md"})

3. Summarize:
   - Required sections for pattern documents
   - Metadata requirements
   - File naming conventions
   - Key workflow steps for creation vs updates

4. Note any special considerations for RPP-related patterns
```

### Step 1.5: Create Research Summary

**Purpose**: Synthesize all research into a comprehensive summary that will guide the remaining phases.

```
Based on all the research conducted, please create a comprehensive summary that includes:

1. Pattern Gap Analysis:
   - List of patterns used in RPP experiments
   - Current documentation status for each (exists in proper location, exists in working docs, missing)
   - Priority ranking based on usage and importance

2. Terminology Mapping:
   - Variations found for similar concepts
   - Recommended standardized terms
   - Rationale for recommendations

3. Relationship Mapping:
   - How patterns connect to each other
   - Dependencies between patterns
   - Scale progression (individual → group → network)

4. Implementation Insights:
   - Key learnings from each experiment about pattern usage
   - Common challenges encountered
   - Successful adaptations made

5. Work Plan Overview:
   - Patterns needing creation (with priority)
   - Patterns needing enhancement (with specific improvements needed)
   - Patterns needing relocation (from working docs to artifacts)
   - Terminology standardization needed
   - Cross-reference updates required

Save this summary as it will be needed for subsequent phases.
```

## Phase 2: Pattern Alignment and Validation

Phase 2 is COMPLETE. See [[phase-2-pattern-alignment-output]] for output

### Context for Phase 2

This phase ensures that all patterns referenced in case studies align with actual SuperBenefit patterns. It's critical to distinguish between true organizational patterns and other concepts like methodologies or frameworks. This phase must occur before any pattern creation to prevent generating misaligned documentation.

See research output from phase 1 for important context: [[phase-1-pattern-research-summary]]

### Preparation for Phase 2

**Purpose**: Establish which patterns are actually used at SuperBenefit and how they're named.

```
I'm working on Phase 2 of the RPP Pattern Improvement Strategy - aligning case study references with actual SuperBenefit patterns.

The core patterns used at SuperBenefit include:
- Coordi-nations
- Peer to peer payments
- DAOs, cells, roles, tasks
- Local nodes
- Token based governance
- Group state

I need to review the case studies and align their pattern references with these actual patterns, removing any non-pattern concepts.
```

### Step 2.1: Map Case Study References to SuperBenefit Patterns

**Purpose**: Create a mapping between what case studies currently reference and what SuperBenefit patterns they should actually use.

```
I need to map the patterns referenced in each case study to actual SuperBenefit patterns. For each case study:

1. AIFS Case Study pattern mapping:
   - "Coordi-nations" → Keep as is (correct pattern)
   - "Gatherings" → Is this a SuperBenefit pattern? If yes, what do we call it? If no, should it be?
   - "Cell Structure" → Map to "cells" pattern
   - "DAO Primitives" → Map to "DAOs" pattern
   - Check if "roles", "tasks", or "Group state" patterns apply

2. ICS Case Study pattern mapping:
   - "Governance Infrastructure" → How does this map? Could reference "DAOs"?
   - "Hypercerts" → Map to "Impact Attestations" 
   - "Green Pill Network Local Chapter" → Map to "Local nodes"
   - "Web3 Onboarding" → Is this a pattern or just a process?
   - Check if "token based governance" or "Group state" apply

3. Equality Fund Case Study pattern mapping:
   - "Crypto-Based Funds Disbursement" → Map to "Peer to peer payments"
   - "A/B Testing Framework" → NOT A PATTERN (remove)
   - "Small-Scale Real Money Pilot" → Is this a pattern or methodology?
   - Check what actual patterns should be referenced

For any unclear mappings, I'll describe the concept and ask: "At SuperBenefit, how do we refer to [concept description]?"
```

### Step 2.2: Identify Non-Pattern Concepts

**Purpose**: Clearly identify which concepts in case studies are not patterns and should be removed or reframed.

```
I need to identify concepts that aren't actually patterns. Please review:

1. Methodologies masquerading as patterns:
   - A/B Testing Framework (already identified as non-pattern)
   - Small-Scale Real Money Pilot (testing approach, not pattern?)
   - Other methodology-like references

2. Technical implementations vs patterns:
   - Are things like "ENS domain" or "multisig wallet" patterns or just tools?
   - What's the distinction at SuperBenefit?

3. Process descriptions vs patterns:
   - "Progressive Onboarding" - process or pattern?
   - "Discovery phase" - clearly not a pattern

For each non-pattern concept:
- Note why it's not a pattern
- Suggest how to reference it without pattern language
- Or ask if it should become a pattern
```

### Step 2.3: Validate Pattern Needs

**Purpose**: Determine which patterns genuinely need to be created versus which are just misnamed references to existing patterns.

```
Based on the mapping exercise, I need to validate what patterns actually need creation:

1. For each "pattern" mentioned in case studies that doesn't map to existing SuperBenefit patterns:
   - Describe the concept clearly
   - Ask: "Is this concept something we use at SuperBenefit? If so, what do we call it?"
   - If it's important but unnamed: "Should this become a pattern? What should we call it?"

2. Examples of concepts to validate:
   - Gatherings: "AIFS used structured yet emergent spaces for cross-sector learning. These weren't typical meetings but facilitated sessions that bridged Web3 and grassroots communities. Is this a pattern at SuperBenefit? What do we call this approach?"
   
   - Impact Attestations: "Both ICS and Equality Fund reference ways to document and verify social/environmental impact on-chain. Do we have a pattern for this? What's our term?"

3. Create a validated list:
   - Patterns that exist and just need proper references
   - Patterns that need to be created (with SuperBenefit-approved names)
   - Concepts that should not be patterns
```

### Step 2.4: Update Case Studies with Correct Pattern References

**Purpose**: Create a plan for updating all case studies to use correct SuperBenefit pattern names and remove non-pattern references.

```
I need to create a comprehensive update plan for the case studies:

1. For each case study, list required changes:
   - Pattern name corrections (old → new)
   - Non-pattern removals
   - Missing pattern additions
   - Context adjustments to support changes

2. AIFS Case Study updates:
   - Keep "Coordi-nations" 
   - Change "Cell Structure" → "cells"
   - Validate "Gatherings" naming
   - Add references to "roles" and "tasks" where applicable
   - Remove or reframe any non-patterns

3. ICS Case Study updates:
   - Change "Green Pill Network Local Chapter" → "Local nodes"
   - Change "Hypercerts" → "Impact Attestations" (if confirmed)
   - Clarify "Governance Infrastructure" mapping
   - Remove non-pattern references

4. Equality Fund Case Study updates:
   - Change "Crypto-Based Funds Disbursement" → "Peer to peer payments"
   - Remove "A/B Testing Framework" entirely
   - Add appropriate pattern references for their actual work

Save this update plan for implementation after pattern documentation is complete.
```

## Phase 3: Priority Pattern Creation

**Phase 3 is COMPLETE.** All high-priority patterns have been created and saved to `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\artifacts\patterns\`:
- ✓ Coordi-nations pattern (HIGHEST priority) - Created with full AIFS implementation details
- ✓ Operational Governance (Enhanced) - Transformed from outline to complete pattern with RPP examples
- ✓ Community Governance (Enhanced) - Added RPP examples while preserving existing quality content
- ✓ Impact Attestations - Created as overarching pattern with hypercerts as one implementation
- ✓ Peer to Peer Payments - Created based on Equality Fund exploration
- ✓ Participatory Governance - Created emphasizing genuine power-sharing

All patterns follow formal report style with complete sections per template. Medium priority patterns (Opportunistic Adoption, DisCo) remain for future work if needed.

### Phase 3 Execution Strategy

#### 1. Create Coordi-nations Pattern (HIGHEST Priority)

**Rationale**: Central to AIFS transformation, extensively documented in case study

**Approach**:

- Extract information from AIFS case study where it's extensively documented
- Use the pattern template and creation workflow
- Focus on practical implementation from AIFS experience
- Include the 7-step framework mentioned in the case study
- Document how AIFS implemented 6 of 7 steps

**Key content to include**:

- Definition of network sovereignty through voluntary association
- The 7-step process for building coordi-nations
- AIFS's practical implementation example
- Contrast with network states and traditional hierarchies

#### 2. Enhance and Relocate Existing Patterns (HIGH Priority)

**Operational Governance**

- Add AIFS examples (AIFSIP-04 separation of operations from community stewardship)
- Complete missing sections using the outline structure
- Move from working docs to artifacts/patterns
- Focus on how autonomous teams coordinate around shared resources

**Community Governance**

- Add AIFS examples of mission protection and values alignment
- Ensure proper format alignment with template
- Move from working docs to artifacts/patterns
- Include the various scale patterns already documented

#### 3. Create Impact Attestations Pattern (HIGH Priority)

**Important clarification**: Hypercerts are a specific implementation of impact attestations

**Approach**:

- Define impact attestations as the general pattern for on-chain impact documentation
- Include hypercerts as one example implementation (used by ICS)
- Extract information from ICS case study
- Focus on how blockchain enables transparent impact tracking
- Include other potential implementations beyond hypercerts

#### 4. Create Peer to peer payments Pattern (HIGH Priority)

**Rationale**: Core to Equality Fund experiment

**Approach**:

- Extract from Equality Fund case study
- Focus on blockchain for international fund transfers
- Address the critical challenges they faced (last-mile delivery, local context)
- Note: Privacy payments pattern already exists in working docs - ensure these are distinguished

#### 5. Create Participatory governance Pattern (HIGH Priority)

**Rationale**: Key to Equality Fund's approach

**Approach**:

- Extract from Equality Fund's stakeholder involvement approaches
- Focus on involving affected communities in decisions
- Distinguish from general community governance (this is more specific to decision processes)

#### 6. Handle MEDIUM Priority Patterns (if time permits)

**Opportunistic Adoption**

- Extract from ICS experience
- Focus on flexible approach to Web3 adoption responding to opportunities
- Document how ICS pivoted based on what worked

**DisCo Pattern**

- Research external reference (https://www.disco.coop/)
- Focus on Distributed Cooperative Organization model
- Note how Equality Fund considered this approach

### Key Implementation Principles

1. **Use existing content**: Extract extensively from case studies rather than inventing new content
2. **Follow templates strictly**: Use the pattern template structure exactly
3. **Maintain RPP focus**: Ensure all examples and context relate to the Reimagining Power experiments
4. **Create working artifacts**: Draft in artifacts for review before saving
5. **Be thorough but concise**: Include all necessary sections without unnecessary elaboration
6. **Respect terminology**: Don't rename things (e.g., hypercerts remain hypercerts, they're just one type of impact attestation)

### Execution Order

1. **Start with Coordi-nations** - highest priority, best documented
2. **Enhance operational & community governance** - already partially complete
3. **Create impact attestations** - clarifies hypercerts relationship
4. **Create peer to peer payments** - addresses Equality Fund needs
5. **Create participatory governance** - completes Equality Fund patterns
6. **Address medium priorities if time allows**

### Success Criteria

- All patterns follow the established template exactly
- Each pattern includes concrete RPP experiment examples
- Patterns in working docs are enhanced and relocated to artifacts/patterns
- Clear distinctions between similar patterns (e.g., privacy payments vs peer to peer payments)
- Terminology is consistent and accurate (e.g., hypercerts as a type of impact attestation)

### CRITICAL FILE HANDLING DIRECTIVES

#### MANDATORY Safeguards for All Future Pattern Work

**1. NEVER Overwrite Existing Files**

- Only add specific sections when enhancing
- Make targeted edits to specific text only
- Create new files only where none exist
- If a file exists, READ IT FIRST before any action

**2. Quality Standards**

- NO outline-style notes or placeholder text
- NO draft-quality work in deliverables
- ALL content must be complete, polished, and professional
- Match or exceed the quality of existing patterns

**3. File Operations Protocol**

- READ files before editing to understand existing content
- PRESERVE all existing high-quality content
- SHOW content in artifacts for review before saving
- VERIFY quality matches existing patterns before saving

**4. Specific Action Rules**

- **Relocate**: Copy content EXACTLY with zero edits
- **Enhance**: Add only what's missing, preserve everything else
- **Create New**: Match quality and style of best existing patterns

**5. Verification Requirements**

- Read file after writing to ensure quality improvement
- Compare before/after to confirm no degradation
- Get confirmation before permanent saves
- If uncertain about quality, ASK before saving

#### Consequences of Violations

Failure to follow these directives causes:

- Week+ delays in critical project timelines
- Loss of trust and credibility
- Destruction of carefully crafted content
- Need for extensive rework and recovery

These directives are PERMANENT and apply to ALL future work on this project.

## Phase 4: Pattern Enhancement and Standardization

### Context for Phase 4

This phase focuses on enhancing existing patterns with RPP examples and ensuring all documentation uses consistent SuperBenefit terminology. You'll need the list of existing patterns and the terminology mapping from earlier phases.

### Preparation for Phase 4

**Purpose**: Reestablish context and understand what enhancements are needed.

```
I'm working on Phase 4 of the RPP Pattern Improvement Strategy - enhancing existing patterns and standardizing terminology.

Please help me prepare by:
1. Listing all existing patterns in: artifacts/patterns/
2. Identifying which existing patterns are referenced in RPP case studies
3. Reviewing the validated pattern names from Phase 2
4. Confirming access to the pattern update workflow
```

### Step 4.1: Enhance Patterns with RPP Examples

**Purpose**: Add RPP implementation examples to existing patterns, making them more concrete and valuable.

```
I need to enhance existing patterns with examples from RPP experiments. For each pattern that has RPP implementations:

1. Start with the CELLS pattern:
   - Get current pattern: get_vault_file({filename: "artifacts/patterns/cells.md"})
   - Search for usage in AIFS case study
   - Add AIFS's cell implementation to Examples section
   - Update Implementation Considerations with learnings
   - Save updated version

2. Continue with other patterns referenced in RPP:
   - DAOs (if used)
   - Local nodes
   - Peer to peer payments
   - Token governance (if used)
   - Impact Attestations
   - Group state (if used)

3. For each enhancement:
   - Preserve valuable existing content
   - Add new RPP examples
   - Update Related Patterns based on actual usage
   - Note implementation variations discovered

Follow the pattern update workflow for each enhancement.
```

### Step 4.2: Update Pattern Relationships

**Purpose**: Ensure all patterns properly reference related patterns based on actual usage in experiments.

```
I need to update pattern relationships across all documentation. Please:

1. For each pattern document:
   - Review the Related Patterns section
   - Add connections discovered in RPP implementations
   - Clarify relationship types

2. Key relationships to document:
   - Coordi-nations → cells relationship
   - Local nodes → Group state relationship
   - DAOs → token based governance relationship
   - Peer to peer payments → Impact Attestations (if applicable)

3. Update each pattern's Related Patterns section to include:
   - Clear explanation of how patterns connect
   - When to use patterns together
   - Implementation sequences from RPP experience
```

## Phase 5: Case Study Updates and Final Integration

### Context for Phase 5

This final phase implements all the pattern alignment changes in the case studies and ensures everything is properly integrated. You'll need the update plan from Phase 2 and all completed pattern documentation.

### Preparation for Phase 5

**Purpose**: Prepare for updating case studies with correct pattern references.

```
I'm working on Phase 5 of the RPP Pattern Improvement Strategy - updating case studies and final integration.

Please help me prepare by:
1. Retrieving the case study update plan from Phase 2
2. Confirming all validated patterns now have documentation in artifacts/patterns/
3. Listing any remaining pattern reference issues
```

### Step 5.1: Update Case Study Pattern References

**Purpose**: Implement all pattern reference corrections in the case studies.

```
I need to update each case study with correct pattern references:

1. For AIFS case study:
   - Get current version
   - Update pattern references per Phase 2 plan
   - Ensure all pattern links point to actual pattern documents
   - Remove any non-pattern references
   - Save updated version

2. For ICS case study:
   - Similar process with their specific updates
   
3. For Equality Fund case study:
   - Remove A/B Testing Framework references entirely
   - Update to use actual SuperBenefit patterns
   - Add missing pattern references where applicable

For each update, maintain the narrative flow while using correct pattern terminology.
```

### Step 5.2: Create Pattern Library Index

**Purpose**: Create an organized index of RPP-relevant patterns for the playbook.

```
I need to create a pattern library index for the RPP playbook:

1. Create "Reimagining Power Pattern Library" document with:
   - Overview of patterns used in RPP experiments
   - How patterns support power redistribution
   - Guide to using patterns effectively

2. Organize patterns by RPP themes:
   - Governance transformation: DAOs, cells, roles, tasks
   - Community coordination: Coordi-nations, Local nodes
   - Financial innovation: Peer to peer payments
   - Accountability: Impact Attestations
   - Collective alignment: Group state

3. For each pattern, include:
   - Brief summary
   - Which experiments used it
   - Key learnings from RPP
   - Link to full documentation

4. Save to: notes/rpp/rpp-playbooks/pattern-library-index.md
```

### Step 5.3: Final Quality Check

**Purpose**: Ensure all pattern documentation and references are properly aligned.

```
Please perform a final quality check:

1. Verify pattern alignment:
   - All case studies use actual SuperBenefit pattern names
   - No made-up patterns remain
   - Non-pattern concepts are properly framed

2. Check pattern documentation:
   - All referenced patterns have documentation
   - RPP examples are included where applicable
   - Pattern relationships reflect actual usage

3. Validate integration:
   - Case studies link to correct patterns
   - Pattern library index is complete
   - No broken references

4. Generate final report showing:
   - Patterns aligned/corrected
   - Documentation created/enhanced
   - Case study updates completed
   - Any remaining issues

This completes the pattern improvement work with proper SuperBenefit alignment.
```

## Using This Strategy

### Execution Notes

1. **Phase 2 is critical** - Pattern alignment and validation must happen before any creation work
2. **Always ask about naming** - Never assume pattern names; always confirm with SuperBenefit terminology
3. **Distinguish patterns from non-patterns** - Not every concept or methodology is a pattern
4. **Use actual language** - Patterns should use the same language SuperBenefit uses when discussing these concepts
5. **Validate before creating** - Confirm a pattern is needed and get the approved name before documentation

### Key Principles for Pattern Work

1. **Patterns are organizational concepts** - They communicate how SuperBenefit approaches coordination and governance
2. **Names matter** - Use SuperBenefit's actual terminology, not academic or external naming
3. **Not everything is a pattern** - Frameworks, methodologies, and processes might not be patterns
4. **Ask when uncertain** - Always describe the concept and ask how SuperBenefit refers to it
5. **Examples must be real** - Use actual RPP implementations, not theoretical applications

### Success Criteria

The pattern improvement work is complete when:

- All case studies reference only actual SuperBenefit patterns
- No made-up or misaligned pattern names remain
- All referenced patterns have proper documentation
- Pattern names align with SuperBenefit's language
- Non-pattern concepts are no longer called patterns
- Documentation supports the RPP playbook effectively

This strategy ensures patterns serve their intended purpose: communicating SuperBenefit's organizational concepts clearly and consistently to stakeholders.
