# Patterns Internal Research Output - Reimagining Power Project

## Research Scope and Methodology

This research analyzed patterns across SuperBenefit's Reimagining Power Project documentation to understand current usage, identify gaps, and inform improvement strategy. The research examined:

- Case study drafts and associated discovery/intervention documents
- Existing pattern documentation in the knowledge base
- Pattern creation and update workflows
- Pattern relationships and dependencies

## Key Findings

### 1. Case Study Documentation Status

**Available Documentation:**
- **AIFS (All In For Sport)**: Comprehensive case study with discovery report and intervention mapping
- **ICS (Institute for Community Sustainability)**: Discovery report and experiment scoping found
- **Equality Fund**: Discovery report found, but no complete case study

**Documentation Analysis:**
- AIFS provides the richest pattern implementation examples
- ICS focuses on governance infrastructure and local node patterns
- Equality Fund emphasizes financial distribution patterns

### 2. Pattern Usage Across Experiments

#### AIFS Patterns

**Explicit Patterns:**
- **Coordi-nations**: Central to transformation, described as "networking aligned communities around shared purpose and resources"
- **Gatherings**: Six sessions conducted, structured yet emergent spaces for cross-sector learning
- **Cell Structure**: Autonomous operational teams within coordi-nation framework
- **DAO Primitives**: Governance transformation using established framework
- **Partnership Governance**: Mentioned but not detailed

**Implicit Patterns:**
- Opportunistic Web3 Adoption (emergent pattern from their journey)
- Inclusive Exclusion Paradox (discovered limitation of universal accessibility)
- Coordination Value Gap (identified but unresolved funding challenge)

#### ICS Patterns

**Explicit Patterns:**
- **Governance Infrastructure**: Multisig, ENS, Hats Protocol, Snapshot, CharmVerse
- **Hypercerts**: For Repair Café impact documentation
- **Green Pill Network Local Chapter**: Establishing London node
- **Web3 Onboarding**: Progressive education approach

**Implicit Patterns:**
- Cosmo-localism (global knowledge, local action)
- MycoFi Framework (biomimetic resource flows)
- Bioregional Hub (economies of scope beyond single node)

#### Equality Fund Patterns

**Explicit Patterns:**
- **Crypto-Based Funds Disbursement**: Addressing international transfer challenges
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Comparing traditional vs blockchain approaches
- **Small-Scale Real Money Pilot**: Using ~$100 for authentic testing

**Implicit Patterns:**
- Privacy-Preserving Eligibility (zero-knowledge proofs)
- Impact Attestations (community-based validation)
- Hyper-Local Context Mapping (city-level infrastructure analysis)

### 3. Pattern Documentation in Knowledge Base

#### Well-Documented Patterns

**From DAO Primitives Framework:**
- CELLS (comprehensive documentation with visual diagrams)
- Governance Processes (detailed frameworks)
- Resource Management (treasury patterns)

**From SuperBenefit Articles:**
- Fractal Centerless Networks
- Minimum Viable Permissionlessness
- Two-House Governance System

**Found in Working Documents (needs relocation):**
- Local Nodes (well-developed but in notes/rpp/rpp-working-docs/)

#### Missing Pattern Documentation

**High Priority (Used in Multiple Experiments):**
1. Coordi-nations - Used extensively in AIFS but no pattern document
2. Gatherings - Implemented by AIFS with detailed outcomes
3. Local Nodes/Chapters - EXISTS in working docs (needs enhancement and proper placement)
4. Quadratic Funding - Mentioned by ICS, widely used in web3
5. Hypercerts/Impact Documentation - Different terms, same concept

**Medium Priority (Single Experiment Usage):**
- Crypto-Based Funds Disbursement (Equality Fund)
- A/B Testing Framework (Equality Fund)
- Green Pill Network Chapter (ICS specific - variation of Local Nodes)
- Progressive Onboarding (ICS approach)

### 4. Terminology Inconsistencies

**Impact Documentation:**
- "Hypercerts" (ICS)
- "Impact Attestations" (Equality Fund)
- "On-chain impact documentation" (general usage)

**Organizational Units:**
- "Cells" (AIFS, DAO Primitives)
- "Sub-DAOs" (occasional usage)
- "Working Groups" (traditional term)
- "Operational Cells" (AIFS specific)

**Local Presence:**
- "Local Nodes" (general)
- "Local Chapters" (Green Pill Network)
- "ReFi Local Nodes" (ICS)
- "Bioregional Hubs" (ICS evolution)

### 5. Pattern Relationships and Dependencies

#### Scale Progression
Individual → Group → Network → Ecosystem

**Individual Level:**
- Roles (Hats Protocol)
- Wallet management
- Individual attestations

**Group Level:**
- Cells
- Multisig governance
- Gatherings

**Network Level:**
- Coordi-nations
- Fractal networks
- Local chapters

**Ecosystem Level:**
- Cross-DAO coordination
- Bioregional hubs
- Global movements (Green Pill)

#### Pattern Dependencies

**Coordi-nations requires:**
- Cell Structure (autonomous units)
- Shared Governance (alignment mechanisms)
- Resource Sharing (sustainability)

**Local Chapters require:**
- Governance Infrastructure
- Community Engagement Patterns
- Connection to Global Network

### 6. Implementation Insights from Case Studies

#### What Worked Well

**AIFS:**
- Flexibility and emergence over rigid planning
- Demonstrating value through action
- Small committed teams as foundation
- External validation building internal confidence

**ICS:**
- Starting with infrastructure before broad adoption
- Making tools enjoyable and accessible
- Connecting to established networks (Green Pill)
- 6-18 month adoption timeline expectation

**Equality Fund:**
- Careful recipient selection for experiments
- Real money testing revealing actual barriers
- Partnership approach with fiscal sponsors
- Focus on last-mile delivery challenges

#### Common Challenges

**Across All Experiments:**
- Sustainable funding for coordination work
- Bridging technical and non-technical communities
- Time required for meaningful adoption
- Balancing innovation with operational needs

### 7. Pattern Quality Assessment

#### Current Pattern Template Structure
- Context
- Challenges  
- Solution Framework
- Implementation Considerations
- Examples & Case Studies
- References

#### What Makes a Good Pattern

**From reviewing existing patterns:**
- Clear problem-solution pairing
- Concrete examples from real implementations
- Balance of theory and practice
- Connections to related patterns
- Accessible language with technical precision
- Visual diagrams where helpful

#### Gaps in Current Patterns

**Structural:**
- Limited visual documentation
- Inconsistent relationship mapping
- Missing dependency information
- No complexity/scale indicators

**Content:**
- Few real-world examples
- Limited failure/challenge documentation
- Minimal adaptation guidance
- Weak cross-pattern navigation

### 8. Web3 Pattern Best Practices

**From broader web3 ecosystem research:**

**Documentation Standards:**
- Multi-layered approach (technical/governance/community views)
- Interactive examples and sandboxes
- Version control for pattern evolution
- Community contribution mechanisms

**Common Web3 Patterns Not Yet Documented:**
- Token Engineering Patterns
- Sybil Resistance Mechanisms  
- Progressive Decentralization
- Exit to Community
- Retroactive Public Goods Funding

**Pattern Libraries in Web3:**
- Commons Stack (Token Engineering Patterns)
- DAOhaus (Moloch Patterns)
- Aragon (Governance Patterns)
- Gitcoin (Public Goods Patterns)

## Recommendations Summary

Based on this research, the pattern improvement strategy should:

1. **Prioritize Missing Core Patterns**: Document Coordi-nations, Gatherings, and other frequently used patterns
2. **Standardize Terminology**: Create canonical terms with clear mappings
3. **Enhance with Case Studies**: Add RPP implementation examples to all relevant patterns
4. **Map Relationships**: Create visual and written documentation of pattern connections
5. **Bridge Audiences**: Ensure patterns work for both technical and non-technical readers
6. **Enable Discovery**: Improve pattern navigation and search capabilities

## Research Limitations

- Only public documentation was analyzed
- Some case studies may still be in development
- Pattern usage in other SuperBenefit projects not examined
- External pattern libraries reviewed but not comprehensively analyzed
