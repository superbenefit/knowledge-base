# RPP Pattern Research Summary - Phase 1 Complete

## Pattern Gap Analysis

### Patterns Used in RPP Experiments

#### Core Patterns (Used Across Multiple Experiments)

1. **Coordi-nations**
   - Status: **MISSING** - No documentation exists
   - Usage: Central to AIFS transformation, described as "networking aligned communities around shared purpose and resources"
   - Priority: **HIGHEST** - Essential pattern for the playbook
   - Description: Network sovereignty through voluntary association and mutual support, creating alternatives to hierarchical organizations

2. **Gatherings**
   - Status: **MISSING** - No documentation exists
   - Usage: Six successful implementations by AIFS with 111 participants
   - Priority: **HIGHEST** - Key bridging mechanism between diverse communities
   - Description: Structured yet emergent spaces for cross-sector learning and relationship building

3. **Local Nodes/Chapters**
   - Status: **EXISTS IN WORKING DOCS** - Well-developed pattern at `notes/rpp/rpp-working-docs/local-nodes.md`
   - Usage: AIFS (as component of Coordi-nations), ICS (as Green Pill London chapter)
   - Priority: **HIGHEST** - Needs RPP examples added and relocation to proper folder
   - Description: Distributed community anchors that bridge global protocols with local communities

1. **Cells**
   - Status: **Exists in DAO Primitives docs:** `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\dao-primitives\implementation\patterns\collaboration-scale-patterns\cell` - Mentioned as having comprehensive documentation in DAO Primitives
   - Usage: AIFS uses cell structure for autonomous operational teams within coordi-nation framework
   - Priority: **MEDIUM** - Need to locate existing documentation and add RPP examples
   - Description: Autonomous teams operating within shared governance framework

1. **Impact Attestations**
   - Status: **MISSING** - No unified pattern exists
   - Usage: ICS uses "Hypercerts", Equality Fund uses "Impact Attestations" (standardize to "Impact attestations when referring to patterns. Don't overwrite uses of "hypercerts" in the ICS case study)
   - Priority: **HIGH** - Terminology needs unification
   - Description: On-chain documentation of social and environmental impact

#### Medium-Priority Patterns (Single Experiment Usage)

6. **Peer-to-Peer Payments**
   - Status: **MISSING**
   - Usage: Equality Fund's eventual core focus
   - Priority: **MEDIUM** - Addresses critical international transfer challenges
   - Description: Using blockchain for international fund transfers

7. **A/B Testing Framework**
   - Status: **NO NOT USE**
   - Usage: Equality Fund methodology
   - Priority: **NONE** - This pattern was confabulated by Claude. This is not a pattern.

8. **Quadratic Funding**
   - Status: **MISSING**
   - Usage: ICS planned implementation
   - Priority: **MEDIUM** - Common web3 pattern
   - Description: Democratic funding mechanism using quadratic voting

9. **Progressive Onboarding**
   - Status: **MISSING** (implicit pattern)
   - Usage: ICS approach to Web3 education
   - Priority: **LOW** - Specific implementation approach
   - Description: Evolution from single workshop to sustained cohort model

6. **Opportunistic Adoption**
    - Status: **MISSING** (emergent pattern)
    - Usage: Discovered pattern from ICS and AIFS experiences
    - Priority: **MEDIUM** - Valuable meta-pattern
    - Description: Flexible approach to Web3 adoption responding to opportunities

### Existing Pattern Documentation Status

#### Well-Documented Patterns (According to Research)
- **CELLS** - Referenced as having comprehensive documentation in DAO Primitives (need to locate)
- **Governance Infrastructure** - Various patterns documented
- **Multisig Governance** - Existing documentation

#### Patterns in Working Documents
- **Local Nodes** - Complete pattern exists at `notes/rpp/rpp-working-docs/local-nodes.md`
  - Well-structured with context, challenges, solution framework
  - Missing: RPP case study examples, proper metadata
  - Action: Add ICS Green Pill and AIFS examples, relocate to `artifacts/patterns/`

## Terminology Mapping

### Recommended Standardizations

1. **Impact Documentation**
   - Current variations: "Hypercerts" (ICS), "Impact Attestations" (Equality Fund), "On-chain impact documentation"
   - Recommended standard: **"Impact Documentation"**
   - Rationale: Neutral term encompassing all variations

2. **Organizational Units**
   - Current variations: "Cells", "Sub-DAOs", "Working Groups", "Operational Cells"
   - Recommended standard: **"Cells"**
   - Rationale: Aligns with DAO Primitives framework

3. **Local Presence**
   - Current variations: "Local Nodes", "Local Chapters", "ReFi Local Nodes", "Bioregional Hubs"
   - Recommended standard: **"Local Nodes"**
   - Rationale: Most generic term, variations noted as implementations

## Relationship Mapping

### Scale Progression
```
Individual → Group → Network → Ecosystem
    ↓           ↓         ↓          ↓
  Roles      Cells   Coordi-nations  Bioregional Hubs
  Wallets   Multisig  Local Nodes   Cross-DAO Coord
  Attestations  Gatherings  Fractal Networks  Global Movements
```

## Implementation Insights

### Success Factors from RPP Experiments

**AIFS:**
- Flexibility and emergence over rigid planning
- Small committed teams as foundation
- Demonstrating value through action
- External validation builds internal confidence

**ICS:**
- Infrastructure first, broad adoption second
- 6-18 month realistic adoption timeline
- Making tools enjoyable increases engagement
- Connection to established networks accelerates growth

**Equality Fund:**
- Real money testing reveals actual barriers
- Hyper-local context matters (city-level, not country)
- Innovation requires dedicated resources
- Last-mile delivery is the real challenge

### Common Challenges
- Sustainable funding for coordination work ("Coordination Value Gap")
- Bridging technical and non-technical communities
- Time required for meaningful adoption (6-18 months)
- Balancing innovation with operational needs

## Next Steps

Phase 1 research is now complete. This summary provides the foundation for:
- Phase 2: Creating missing patterns and enhancing/relocating Local Nodes
- Phase 3: Adding RPP examples to existing patterns
- Phase 4: Creating cross-references and pattern library index

Each subsequent phase can reference this research summary to maintain continuity.
