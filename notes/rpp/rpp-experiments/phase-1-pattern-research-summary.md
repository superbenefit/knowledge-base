### Patterns Used in RPP Experiments

#### Core Patterns (Used Across Multiple Experiments)

1. **Coordi-nations**
   - Status: **MISSING** - No documentation exists
   - Usage: Central to AIFS transformation, described as "networking aligned communities around shared purpose and resources"
   - Priority: **HIGHEST** - Essential pattern for the playbook
   - Description: Network sovereignty through voluntary association and mutual support, creating alternatives to hierarchical organizations

2. **Gatherings**
   - Status: **MISSING** - No documentation exists
   - Usage: Six successful implementations by AIFS with 111 participants
   - Priority: **HIGHEST** - Key bridging mechanism between diverse communities
   - Description: Structured yet emergent spaces for cross-sector learning and relationship building

3. **Local Nodes/Chapters**
   - Status: **EXISTS IN WORKING DOCS** - Well-developed pattern at `notes/rpp/rpp-working-docs/local-nodes.md`
   - Usage: AIFS (as component of Coordi-nations), ICS (as Green Pill London chapter)
   - Priority: **HIGHEST** - Needs RPP examples added and relocation to proper folder

### Existing Pattern Documentation Status

#### Well-Documented Patterns (According to Research)
- **CELLS** - Referenced as having comprehensive documentation in DAO Primitives (need to locate)
- **Governance Infrastructure** - Various patterns documented
- **Multisig Governance** - Existing documentation

#### Patterns in Working Documents
- **Local Nodes** - Complete pattern exists at `notes/rpp/rpp-working-docs/local-nodes.md`
  - Well-structured with context, challenges, solution framework
  - Missing: RPP case study examples, proper metadata
  - Action: Add ICS Green Pill and AIFS examples, relocate to `artifacts/patterns/`

#### Completely Missing Patterns
1. Coordi-nations
2. Gatherings
3. Impact Documentation (unified pattern)
4. Crypto-Based Funds Disbursement
5. A/B Testing Framework
6. Quadratic Funding
7. Opportunistic Web3 Adoption

## Terminology Mapping

### Recommended Standardizations

1. **Impact Documentation**
   - Current variations: "Hypercerts" (ICS), "Impact Attestations" (Equality Fund), "On-chain impact documentation"
   - Recommended standard: **"Impact Documentation"**
   - Rationale: Neutral term encompassing all variations

2. **Organizational Units**
   - Current variations: "Cells", "Sub-DAOs", "Working Groups", "Operational Cells"
   - Recommended standard: **"Cells"**
   - Rationale: Aligns with DAO Primitives framework

3. **Local Presence**
   - Current variations: "Local Nodes", "Local Chapters", "ReFi Local Nodes", "Bioregional Hubs"
   - Recommended standard: **"Local Nodes"**
   - Rationale: Most generic term, variations noted as implementations

## Relationship Mapping

### Scale Progression
```
Individual → Group → Network → Ecosystem
    ↓           ↓         ↓          ↓
  Roles      Cells   Coordi-nations  Bioregional Hubs
  Wallets   Multisig  Local Nodes   Cross-DAO Coord
  Attestations  Gatherings  Fractal Networks  Global Movements
```

### Key Pattern Dependencies

**Coordi-nations requires:**
- Cell Structure (autonomous units)
- Shared Governance (alignment mechanisms)
- Resource Sharing (sustainability mechanisms)
- Local Nodes (distributed presence)

**Local Nodes requires:**
- Governance Infrastructure
- Community Engagement Patterns
- Connection to Global Network
- Resource Circulation Mechanisms

**Gatherings enables:**
- Cross-sector relationship building
- Knowledge exchange
- Trust formation
- Pattern discovery

## Implementation Insights

### Success Factors from RPP Experiments

**AIFS:**
- Flexibility and emergence over rigid planning
- Small committed teams as foundation
- Demonstrating value through action
- External validation builds internal confidence

**ICS:**
- Infrastructure first, broad adoption second
- 6-18 month realistic adoption timeline
- Making tools enjoyable increases engagement
- Connection to established networks accelerates growth

**Equality Fund:**
- Real money testing reveals actual barriers
- Hyper-local context matters (city-level, not country)
- Innovation requires dedicated resources
- Last-mile delivery is the real challenge

### Common Challenges
- Sustainable funding for coordination work ("Coordination Value Gap")
- Bridging technical and non-technical communities
- Time required for meaningful adoption (6-18 months)
- Balancing innovation with operational needs
