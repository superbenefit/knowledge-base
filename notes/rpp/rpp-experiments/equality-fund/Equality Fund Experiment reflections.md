# Reflection Exploration Guide

This guide helps you capture learning from implementation experiences. Use it whenever you pause to reflect - after key events, at milestones, or when something surprising happens. The questions help surface insights while they're fresh.

## Setting the Context

_Why this matters: Clear context helps others understand what you're reflecting on and enables you to track patterns across multiple reflections._

Consider noting:

- What period or activities does this reflection cover? - 

- Experiment initiated: October 24, 2024 Retrospective Meeting: July 7, 2025 OTF Grant period ending: July 31, 2025 Discovery phase conducted through early 2025

  - July 7, 2025 - Sue Snider, Nicole Matuska, Heenal Rajani, rather and Michelle Baldwin

- What were you trying to achieve (from Intervention plans)?

  - We believe that Web3 infrastructure can lower the barriers to disbursing grant funds around the world. Specifically: 

      - Decrease the administrative costs of moving grant funds around the world, as compared to costs incurred using the traditional financial system; and 

      - Increase accessibility, safety and security of financial infrastructure to support the work of grantee partners facing closing civic space, financial restrictions, and harassment by authoritarian regimes.

- **Who was involved in these activities?**

  - Equality Fund Team: Sue Snider (Director of Granting & Operations), Finance Team 

  - Women Win Team: Nicole Matuska (US Director), Finance Coordinator, Finance Manager, Programme Officer 

  - SuperBenefit Team: Web3 technical expertise and blockchain experience 

  - Dalan Fund: Grant recipient partner

  -  Fund Recipients: Organizations in Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Ukraine Reimagining Power 

  - Project Partners: Ontario Trillium Foundation, Community Foundations Canada

- Why are you pausing to reflect now?

  - OTF Grant ends July 31

  - Experiments highly emergent and involved many partners 

  - Need to assess progress on innovation experiments that are emergent by definition 

  - Key team changes created detours in the project 

  - Need to determine if we're on track for what's possible

  - How to keep experiments in scope with quick learning cycles and feedback loops

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**

- **Reflection scope**: Specific dates, events, or phase covered \*

- **Original intentions**: What you planned to do and why \*

## What Actually Happened

_Why this matters: Before analyzing or interpreting, it's valuable to simply document what occurred. This creates a factual foundation for deeper reflection._

Consider capturing:

- What activities or interventions took place?

  - inside spreadsheet - Nicole and Sue assuming the mapping needs to happen before the web3 team sees how would link to the blockchain 

  - Discovery Phase: Comprehensive analysis of Equality Fund's grant-making process across five key areas:

 Initial screening & evaluation Portfolio selection & proposal Decision-making & approval process Grant administration and disbursal Beyond the current process

 Financial Mapping: Nicole and Sue worked on mapping grant transaction flows, assuming this mapping needed to happen before the web3 team could understand blockchain integration possibilities 

  - A/B Test Design: Developed framework for comparing traditional financial networks (A Test using historical data) with Web3 infrastructure in sandbox environment (B Test)

- Who participated and how?

  - **EF - Sue Snider, Director of Granting & Operations, Finance Team**

  - **WW - Nicole Matuska**, (US Director), Finance Coordinator, Finance Manager, Programme Officer

  - On-Granting - countries represented -  Armenia Belarus Kazakhstan Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan Ukraine

    - more specific locals will give more info for web3 research, recognize some confidentiality that needs to be protected if get too specific with locality 

- What outputs or outcomes emerged?

  - Financial Transaction Analysis: Early insights revealed that transaction fees are not as significant a barrier as initially expected for EF-to-WW transfers 
 Contextual Understanding: Recognition that hyper-local context is critical - country-level analysis insufficient, need city/community level understanding 

  - Infrastructure Assessment: Identified that some regions (Ukraine) have good local crypto knowledge and off-ramp capabilities, while others lack accessible infrastructure 

  - Process Documentation: Comprehensive discovery report outlining Web3 opportunities in grant-making

 Early insight on the face of it, financial transactions not a huge barrier, fees for EF to WW money and to the grantee partners, so far does not strike that fees in moving money around - but money bounces back, so need to unpack more about traditional banking system 

    - if only look at data does not tell full story

    - recognition of Coding for Context

    - is this specific to this grant cycle, or is it different for other funds/orgs - can transaction costs be higher for other groups

    - currency conversation an issue? 

- How did timing unfold compared to plans?

  - Took a bit to narrow scope of project as we started off with the following ideas:

    - Initial screening & evaluation

    - Portfolio selection & proposal

    - Decision-making & approval process

    - Grant administration and disbursal 

    - Beyond the current process


Project took longer to narrow scope than anticipated Started with broad exploration of five different areas before focusing on two specific barriers 

Team changes at Equality Fund slowed momentum 

Required input from numerous team members at both EF and WW to move forward 

Project timeline extended beyond original OTF grant period

The two barriers that we focused on for the experiment were: Financial: Grant disbursements incur a significant cost as transactions move through various countries and foreign currency conversions. In addition, many countries strategically increase the financial costs of moving money to partners as a strategy to challenge human rights and gender justice activists and movements working inside of authoritarian and politically dangerous contexts. This experiment will help us understand if and how Web3 infrastructure can decrease the administrative costs of moving grant funds around the world, as compared to costs incurred using the traditional financial system.

Accessibility: Gender justice activists, movements, and organizations are increasingly facing closing civic space, financial restrictions, and harassment by authoritarian regimes that are actively working to roll back rights around the world. This experiment will help us better understand if and how Web3 tools can provide grantee partners with a more accessible, safe and censorship-resistant financial infrastructure to support their work.

Due to changes in the team at Equality Fund it slowed down the momentum and numerous team members at both Equality Fund and Women Win were required for the research and information to move this foward.

## Surprises and Discoveries

_Why this matters: The unexpected often teaches us the most. Capturing surprises helps identify assumptions and reveals new understanding._

Consider exploring:

- What happened that you didn't expect?

  - conversations inside the EF with grantmaking operations that is more strategic side of finance, they have more interest and excitement, Director Grantmaking Operations is the leverage point in this experiment not the Finance team - DGO she can drive this more than Sue's role

    - finding right leverage point and person is critical

  - Sue - personally I heard alot about how expensive it is to move money around world, surprise, certain jurisdictions we are bleeding funds, if data informed, what % of grant portfolio are problematic, finance & operations - frustrating 

    - is experiment too narrow

    - one has bounced back 

    - can't make general statement yet need to understand experiences for last mile of transaction

    - was not surprising that EF/WW move money without fees

    - political environments where assets can be seized at any point - control of funds and maintaining access, risk of being unbanked

      - Ukraine - knows how to use off ramp crypto, good local knowledge 

      - Other places - may have difficulty starting that convo 

    - WW send money to same country for different platforms - bank and third party platform used - reason why sometimes works - ask WW Finance person

    - Part of banking systems is so intentionally not providing info - why does not process one week but does another week - pivot and switch to get the money in - this has been learned behind the scenes to get money into a similar region

    - Unpacking the signals that have driven the need for the experiment - banks don't say we won't process this transaction and go find somewhere else in the Global North

    - Signals to encourage us to pursue the experiment

- What didn't happen that you thought would?


Expected to find clear cost savings from Web3 infrastructure, but traditional banking costs were lower than anticipated for EF-WW transfers 

Assumed country-level mapping would be sufficient, but discovered need for city/community-level analysis 

Expected clearer patterns across small transaction set, but found incomplete picture requiring deeper investigation


- What new questions or possibilities emerged?

  - More hyper local context is really important, went in assuming that country level was enough info that could off bridge to local currency; needs to go to city or community

    - rather - depends - Armenia, Nigeria, Ukraine - you can make country wide assumptions because more formal infrastructure, services or money changers in local contexts but they don't have presence online and is word of mouth, really hard to discover

      - not alot of notorious examples

      - depends on remittances of people and going outside of money and sending money back in e.g Middle East


  - evolving space and context for all of this - political/availability of off ramping/government regulation- changes month to month if not more rapidly, mapping that of options or networks for on and off ramping - what could a living mapping for off ramp solutions by country

- How much can we learn from one small slice of transactions within a larger portfolio? 

- What would a living mapping of off-ramp solutions by country look like? 

- Can decentralized finance provide opportunities for women's funds beyond transaction costs

- How do we balance innovation with the busy operational work of moving money globally?

- What assumptions were challenged?

  - How much can we learn from one small slice of transitions of what is happening inside a portfolio, EF-WW-Dalan Fund - to specific region 

    - we can continue down this path of learning and whether decentralized finance is an opportunity for womens funds

That transaction fees were a major barrier (proved partially incorrect) 

That Web3 infrastructure would clearly demonstrate cost advantages 

That country-level analysis would provide sufficient detail for implementation 

That financial data alone would tell the complete story

## Stakeholder Experiences

_Why this matters: Different people experience the same activities differently. Capturing multiple perspectives creates a richer, more honest picture of what happened._

Equality Fund Finance Team:

Expressed frustration about lack of data-informed decision making Surprised by actual transaction cost data vs. assumptions Struggled to prioritize innovation work alongside operational responsibilities

Women Win Operations:

Found complexity in coordinating across finance, program, and innovation teams No dedicated team structure for innovation projects Learned behind-the-scenes workarounds for getting money into difficult regions

SuperBenefit Technical Team:

Appreciated "stick-to-it-ness" despite challenges Recognized necessary challenges in merging different information worlds Emphasized need for patience in complex partnership model

Grant Recipients:

Limited direct involvement due to timing and partnership structure Recognized need for confidentiality protection when discussing specific locations Varied levels of crypto infrastructure and knowledge across regions

Consider gathering:

Due to timing based on partnership not Dalan Fund and grantees

- How did different groups experience the activities?

  - recognition that it takes a really informed partnership model to test something like this

  - even Sue and Nicole don't have info off top of head - Operations, Finance, Program Officer, Innovation Team, SuperBenefit with blockchain experience

  - Hard to date because nobody's job to do innovation - in parallel to doing busy work of moving money around the world

  - starting and stopped - takes intelligence from so many individuals

  - no team for this project within WW - could have set it up differently 

  - would have done this as a Design Sprint from WW and EF and Dalan Fund and grant recipients in one week - different teams working in parallel

  - hard to do innovation off side of desk

  - SuperBenefit - just getting started, different scenarios, appreciate stick to it ness, not get disheartened and learning opportunity it can bring to so many

    - necessary challenges in trying to merge different worlds of information with very little context 

    - being patient 

    - would be good to hear how recipients are situated in place - sometimes uncertain and sensitive topics

    - wait for right leverage moment to dig in

- What feedback (formal or informal) did you receive?

"Recognition that it takes a really informed partnership model to test something like this" 

"Hard to do innovation off side of desk" - need dedicated resources for innovation work 

"Would have done this as a Design Sprint" - suggestion for more intensive, focused approach 

Need to "wait for right leverage moment to dig in" with sensitive recipient conversations

- Whose experience was most transformed?

- 

- Where did experiences diverge from expectations?

  - Innovation proved more resource-intensive than anticipated 

  - Required much more coordination across teams than expected 

  - Need for confidentiality and sensitivity around recipient contexts created additional complexity 

  - Multiple false starts and restarts required more patience than planned

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**

- **Direct quotes**: Exact words from participants (with permission) \*

- **Experience variations**: How different groups experienced the same things \*

- **Satisfaction indicators**: What pleased or frustrated people \*

## Progress Against Intentions

_Why this matters: Connecting back to original goals helps assess whether efforts are moving in the right direction and what adjustments might be needed._

Consider assessing:

- Which Discovery challenges are being addressed?

Financial barriers: Partially addressed through transaction cost analysis, though findings were unexpected 

Accessibility barriers: Early exploration conducted, but limited progress on actual Web3 implementation 

Technical feasibility: Sandbox environment designed but not fully implemented 

Desirability assessment: Limited progress due to constraints on recipient engagement

- How are success indicators trending?'

Cost comparison: Initial data suggests traditional banking costs lower than expected for EF-WW transfers 

Technical implementation: Design phase completed, but actual Web3 testing limited Recipient accessibility: Assessment incomplete due to project scope constraints

- What planned outcomes are emerging?

Comprehensive understanding of current transaction flows 

Identification of leverage points within organizations 

Recognition of context-specific implementation requirements 

Framework for A/B testing traditional vs. Web3 infrastructure

- Where is progress different than expected?

Focus shifted from proving Web3 advantages to understanding traditional banking limitations Emphasis moved from cost savings to accessibility and infrastructure challenges 

Timeline extended significantly due to organizational complexity 

Scope narrowed to specific transaction pathways rather than broader experimentation

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**

- **Challenge progress**: Movement on specific Discovery challenges \*

- **Metric updates**: Current state vs. baselines from Discovery \*

- **Success indicator status**: Which are being met, which aren't \*

- **Unexpected progress**: Improvements in unplanned areas \*

- **Stalled areas**: Where change isn't happening \*

## Challenges and Responses

_Why this matters: How you handle obstacles teaches valuable lessons. Documenting challenges and responses helps others prepare for similar situations._

Consider documenting:

- What specific challenges arose?

  - if not able to articulate problem or outcome to orient teams for workflow and prioritization without speaking to the impact for the grantee partners

  - HR shifts in both EF/WW slowed down experiment 

  - Can't articulate why critically important work from the beginning of experiment - not for lack of support for experiment inside the organization 

    - what are we solving for at the end of the transaction cycle

- How did they connect to anticipated risks?

  - low risk experiment - map a real transaction to the blockchain

  - we wondered if we could do with a real transaction, even if $100

  - how far can you go before have to move money on the blockchain and then how does that trigger more review, behaviour and risk

  - low risk by design

  - higher risks will be evaluated depending on the experiment outcomes 

  - trying to take historical data - form of A/B testing 

  - some grantees may see this as a way to get around to regulatory barriers but not engaging in this right now in this experiment

    - foreign agent laws - have to report if receiving money outside of the country and can cut off for example

    - internal due diligence - not practical challenge in moving monies

  - audit processes - institutional and global regulations so don't raise flags for nonprofit and charitable status

- What responses did you try?

- What worked or didn't work, and why?

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**

- **Challenge descriptions**: Specific obstacles encountered \*

- **Risk realization**: Which anticipated risks materialized \*

- **Response strategies**: What you tried to address challenges \*

- **Effectiveness assessment**: What worked, partially worked, or failed \*

## Patterns and Insights

_Why this matters: Stepping back to see patterns helps extract transferable learning that goes beyond your specific context._

Consider exploring:

- What patterns are you noticing across experiences?

  - pattern over small set of transactions does not look like transaction fees are a major barrier and need to look under hood with those on the ground and context specific - incomplete pattern

- What's becoming clearer about how change happens here

Innovation in financial infrastructure requires dedicated resources and team structures 

Partnership models need clear coordination frameworks and shared understanding 

Technical solutions must account for hyper-local political and infrastructure realities 

Change happens through finding organizational leverage points, not just technical implementation

- What insights would you share with others starting similar work?

Design Sprint approach with all stakeholders in one intensive week rather than extended coordination Identify organizational champions early and ensure they have dedicated time for innovation 

Assume country-level analysis is insufficient - plan for community-level context research 

Balance low-risk experimentation with meaningful learning opportunities 

Build in flexibility for emergent discoveries that challenge initial assumptions

- What are you understanding differently now?

Transaction costs may not be the primary barrier Web3 can address 

Accessibility and censorship resistance may be more important than cost savings Local infrastructure and knowledge vary dramatically across regions 

Organizational change management is as critical as technical implementation Innovation requires different resource allocation and team structures than operational work

ðŸ“‹ **Information to Capture for Later Use:**

- **Recurring patterns**: What keeps showing up \*

- **System insights**: How change works in this context \*

- **Transferable principles**: What might apply elsewhere \*

- **Evolved understanding**: How your thinking has changed \*

- **Key learnings**: Most important insights so far \*

## Next Steps and Adaptations

_Why this matters: Reflection should inform action. Capturing how insights will influence next steps ensures learning leads to improvement._

Consider:

- Based on this reflection, what will you do differently?

Meet with Dalan Fund before July 31 OTF grant end, even without completed testing 

Create structured interview guide for Sue and Nicole to facilitate partner conversations 

Continue learning beyond OTF grant period to build on foundation established 

Focus on understanding barriers at community level rather than country level 

Seek dedicated innovation resources rather than expecting work "off side of desk"

- What questions need further exploration?

What percentage of grant portfolio faces problematic transaction barriers? 

How do specific political environments affect crypto on/off-ramp accessibility? 

What would living mapping of regional Web3 infrastructure look like? 

How can we test Web3 solutions with real recipients while managing risk and confidentiality? 

What organizational structures best support financial innovation experimentation?

- Who else should be involved going forward?

  - before end of month meeting with Dalan Fund - even if have not tested for them can share from perspective of the partner and share barriers

    - create an interview guide for Sue and Nicole to hold the meeting

    - Sue will ask 

- Grant recipients with established crypto knowledge and infrastructure (early adopters) 

- Local money changers and informal financial service providers 

- Regional crypto infrastructure providers and exchanges 

- Regulatory and compliance experts familiar with nonprofit Web3 usage 

- Dedicated innovation team members with protected time for experimentation

- How will you share and apply these insights?

  - check in before July 31 OTF grant but will continue beyond that date

  - Continue experiment beyond OTF grant period with refined scope 

  - Develop Web3 playbook for nonprofit and social impact organizations 

  - Share learnings with Reimagining Power Project partners 

  - Create framework for other funders considering Web3 experimentation 

  - Document partnership model learnings for future collaborative innovation projects
