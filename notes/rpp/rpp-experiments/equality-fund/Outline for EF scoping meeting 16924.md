**Context:**

- We have 1 hour for the call with members of the RP core team and Sue Snider from Equality Fund

- There has already been some discovery work done to explore EF's current processes. So we are not starting fresh and don't require an initial broad mapping step. We can go straight to the specific areas that EF want to explore. 

- In the call we will not be trying to actually scope an experiment. We are aiming to discover potential opportunities that we can explore and scope in the steps that follow the call.

**Goals for the call**

1. To build a shared understanding of the specific areas of the EF grant-making process that they would like to experiment on. 

2. To identify the high potential areas of intervention 

3. To understand the scope that an experiment might cover (time, resources etc)

4. To explore early experiment ideas to consider

  

**During the call we will attempt to answer the following questions:**

1. What is the specific problem space that Equality fund are trying to address?


1. Map the specific problem space that has been surfaced in previous discovery conversations and get to a solid shared understanding of what EF is trying to approach

2. Do this in notes or in [Figjam](https://www.figma.com/board/ct2DHgl4NjNEyqOadB13ml/Reimagining-Power---Project-Planning?node-id=0-1&t=1GHvXbF6fIbjypeh-1)

3. What are the systemic issues present in the existing system? 

4. How does EF's current approach attempt to navigate existing systems of power?

5. What risks are aspects of the current system trying to protect against?


1. Across the different flows that have been mapped above, what aspects are changeable and unchangeable


1. Where can agency, voice, power etc be distributed differently in the system?

2. How might this make the system more efficient, robust, equitable, collectively intelligent etc?


1. What capacity and resources does Equality Fund have to contribute into the experiment and how would they like to participate?

2. **What early ideas exist for patterns that could be experimented on to transform this aspect of Equality Funds practice?  (include input from the RPP team on possible approaches)**


**Next steps**

The RPP team will:

-  Translate the progress from the session into a sharable writeup. 

- Work up some possible experimental options based on web3 coordination patterns and tooling

- Set up another meeting to discuss these (with Sue or whomever Sue nominates from EF)
