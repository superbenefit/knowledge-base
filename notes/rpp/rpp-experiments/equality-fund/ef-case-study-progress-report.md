# Learning Prerequisites for Web3 Adoption in Grant-Making: Progress Report

_Equality Fund's ongoing experiment reveals essential organizational and infrastructure prerequisites for blockchain implementation in international development_

**An Equality Fund Progress Report on Web3 Financial Infrastructure Experimentation**

---

## Executive Summary

This case study documents progress through July 2025 in an ongoing experiment exploring Web3 technologies for feminist grant-making. Equality Fund partnered with Women Win and SuperBenefit through the Reimagining Power Project to test whether blockchain could reduce transaction costs and increase accessibility for organizations in politically restricted contexts.

The discovery phase examined five potential Web3 applications before narrowing to grant disbursement infrastructure. The team designed an A/B testing framework to compare traditional banking with blockchain solutions, planning small-scale experiments with real money. However, initial findings challenged core assumptions. Transaction costs between Equality Fund and Women Win proved minimal, contradicting the hypothesis that fees were a primary barrier. The real friction emerged at the last mile of delivery, where local banking systems, political restrictions, and infrastructure limitations created obstacles.

The experiment revealed that innovation work cannot succeed as an add-on to operational responsibilities. All participating staff balanced experimental activities with full-time operational duties, leading to starts and stops that limited progress. Direct engagement with grant recipients remained minimal due to safety and regulatory constraints. While technical implementation was limited, the experiment generated valuable insights about prerequisites for blockchain adoption, including the need for hyper-local infrastructure understanding and dedicated innovation resources. The work continues beyond this documentation period, building on these foundational learnings.

## Context

Equality Fund, a Canadian women's fund that grew from $500,000 to $20 million in grant-making over three years, operates across 85 countries supporting women's organizations. Their Prepare funding stream manages CAD 7 million, selecting 6-7 grants from approximately 1,000 applications annually.

The organization faced systemic challenges in moving funds internationally. Transaction fees, currency conversions, and intermediary charges created financial barriers. In some jurisdictions, banking systems obstructed funding flows to human rights organizations. Gender justice activists faced closing civic space globally, with financial systems often excluding or scrutinizing organizations working on sensitive issues. Additionally, participatory approaches that worked at smaller scale showed strain at $20 million.

In July 2023, Sue Snider presented a Distributed Cooperative Organization (DISCO) vision encompassing resource exchange, governance compensation, and grant distribution. When the Reimagining Power Project opportunity emerged in October 2024, it created a pathway to explore Web3 solutions. The partnership brought together Equality Fund's grant-making expertise, Women Win's operational knowledge as fiscal sponsor, and SuperBenefit's Web3 technical capabilities.

Ontario Trillium Foundation provided funding through July 2025. The experiment aimed to test whether blockchain could reduce financial barriers and increase accessibility in restricted contexts. Initial constraints included limited Web3 expertise across partner organizations, regulatory uncertainties for charitable organizations using cryptocurrency, and the need to maintain normal operations while experimenting. The team recognized early that any solution would need to work within existing operational realities rather than requiring wholesale system replacement.

## Approach

The discovery phase evaluated five potential Web3 applications before narrowing to two specific barriers: financial costs and accessibility challenges. This prioritization reflected recognition that focused experiments generate more actionable insights than broad transformation attempts.

Three patterns guided the experiment design:

**Crypto-Based Funds Disbursement** aimed to test whether stablecoins could reduce transaction fees and provide censorship resistance. The approach would compare costs, settlement times, and accessibility between traditional banking and blockchain infrastructure while maintaining compliance standards.

**A/B Testing Framework** created a methodology for meaningful comparison without disrupting operations. Historical transaction data would establish baselines (A Test), while controlled Web3 transactions would generate comparative data (B Test). This design ensured learning value even with limited implementation.

**Small-Scale Real Money Pilot** committed to using approximately $100 in actual funds rather than sandbox testing. Real money would reveal regulatory hurdles, user experience challenges, and operational integration requirements that theoretical testing would miss.

The experiment operated entirely through part-time staff contributions. Sue Snider (Equality Fund), Women Win's finance team (6-7 people managing $30 million annually), and SuperBenefit advisors balanced experimental work with full operational responsibilities. No dedicated innovation team existed. While OTF funding supported coordination, it couldn't cover cryptocurrency purchases for testing or dedicated technical development. The partnership combined complementary expertise, though direct input from grant recipients remained absent due to safety constraints.

These patterns required adaptation as implementation began. The team decided to run experiments parallel to actual disbursements, extract learning before considering operational changes, and prioritize partner safety over experimental boldness.

## What Happened

### Discovery Phase (October 2024 - January 2025)

The systematic discovery process examined five potential Web3 applications, generating a 60-page report. The team found that many possibilities required years of additional development, regulatory barriers limited charity participation, and partner readiness varied significantly. After analysis, they concluded: "while many identified opportunities require further technological maturation, two patterns emerged as immediately viable for experimentation." The focus narrowed to grant disbursement, specifically addressing transaction costs and accessibility barriers.

### Planning Phase (February - May 2025)

The March 2025 partner meeting established key parameters: focus solely on grant-making flows, use real money (~$100) for authentic testing, and maintain separation from actual disbursements. Women Win's finance team revealed the complexity hidden within "international transfers" - their seven-person team managing $30 million annually dealt with bounced payments, varying bank requirements, and cumbersome internal processes.

A critical insight emerged about organizational dynamics: "Director Grantmaking Operations is the leverage point in this experiment not the Finance team." This identified who could actually drive implementation rather than just provide input. The team also recognized that innovation work competed with daily operational demands, as no one had dedicated time for experimentation.

### Implementation Attempt (May - July 2025)

The July 2025 reflection meeting revealed why full implementation hadn't occurred. Sue Snider noted: "personally I heard a lot about how expensive it is to move money around world, surprise... was not surprising that EF/WW move money without fees." The assumed problem—high transaction costs between major organizations—didn't exist. The real friction occurred in last-mile delivery to recipients.

The team discovered that country-level analysis was insufficient: "More hyper local context is really important, went in assuming that country level was enough info... needs to go to city or community." While some Ukrainian cities had sophisticated crypto infrastructure, other locations lacked basic banking reliability.

Organizational constraints proved decisive. Team changes disrupted continuity. Work kept "starting and stopping" as operational priorities took precedence. The reflection that they "would have done this as a Design Sprint from WW and EF and Dalan Fund and grant recipients in one week" captured a key learning: innovation requires concentrated effort, not distributed partial attention.

## Insights & Implications

### Key Discoveries

The experiment's quantitative outcomes diverged from targets but provided valuable data:

|Metric|Target|Achieved|Learning|
|---|---|---|---|
|Web3 transactions|Test implementation|0 completed|Prerequisites not met|
|Scope|5 areas|2 areas|Focus proved essential|
|Timeline|3 months|9+ months|Innovation requires patience|
|Direct recipient engagement|Multiple partners|Limited due to safety|Need new engagement models|

More significant were the conceptual shifts. The assumption that transaction costs were the primary barrier proved incorrect for major organizational transfers. The real challenges emerged at the last mile—political restrictions, local banking limitations, and infrastructure gaps. This finding challenges the blockchain sector's emphasis on cost reduction as the primary value proposition.

The experiment revealed that context varies dramatically at hyper-local levels. Infrastructure differences exist not just between countries but between cities and neighborhoods. Some Ukrainian cities have established crypto exchanges and local expertise, while nearby locations lack basic banking reliability. This granular variation was invisible in country-level analysis.

Partnership complexity grew geometrically with each organization involved. Coordinating across Equality Fund, Women Win, and SuperBenefit created friction that slowed progress. Different risk tolerances, urgency levels, and organizational priorities required constant negotiation. The absence of dedicated innovation resources meant experimental work consistently lost priority to operational demands.

### Pattern Performance

None of the three patterns achieved full implementation, yet each generated insights:

**Crypto-Based Funds Disbursement** planning revealed that existing banking relationships between Equality Fund and Women Win already minimized costs. The opportunity lay in last-mile delivery, but this required extensive infrastructure—privacy technologies, local exchanges, regulatory compliance—that didn't exist in most contexts.

**A/B Testing Framework** remained conceptually sound but faced practical barriers. Privacy concerns limited historical data access. Partner capacity prevented parallel testing. The framework's value lay in revealing these prerequisites.

**Small-Scale Real Money Pilot** validated its premise through planning alone. The process exposed regulatory complexities and safety considerations that sandbox testing would have missed.

### Implications for Future Work

The experiment suggests several considerations for organizations exploring similar innovations:

Organizations benefit from assessing whether they have dedicated innovation resources rather than expecting additional duties from operational staff. The experiment showed that organizational champions need authority to implement changes, not just advocate for them. Intensive, focused efforts like Design Sprints may generate better results than extended partial engagement.

For international innovations, hyper-local infrastructure mapping proves more valuable than regional analysis. Political and regulatory environments change rapidly. Informal systems often matter more than official infrastructure. Understanding these variations requires local partners and sustained engagement.

The experiment's value lay in discovering prerequisites rather than implementing solutions. This approach—using limited experiments to reveal requirements—offers a risk-managed path for innovation in uncertain domains. Rather than assuming technology solves systemic challenges, organizations might first understand what makes solutions viable in specific contexts.

## Next Steps

This progress report captures learnings through July 2025, with the experiment continuing beyond the OTF grant period. The team plans to meet with Dalan Fund before month end to gather recipient perspective, even without completed technical testing. Sue Snider and Nicole Matuska will use structured interviews to understand barriers at the partner level.

The core discovery—that transaction costs aren't the primary barrier—redirects future efforts toward addressing last-mile delivery challenges and building organizational innovation capacity. The partnership will explore how to create dedicated innovation resources and test concentrated approaches like Design Sprints.

Several questions guide continued exploration: What percentage of Equality Fund's portfolio faces significant transaction barriers? How do specific political environments affect crypto accessibility? What organizational structures best support financial innovation in the nonprofit sector?

The experiment didn't move money via blockchain, but it moved understanding forward. By revealing that assumed problems didn't exist while identifying real barriers, the work prevents larger failures and points toward productive paths. The learnings about hyper-local context, innovation resource requirements, and prerequisite discovery provide foundation for future phases.

The team invites others exploring Web3 for social benefit to build on these insights. Sometimes the most valuable experiments are those that reveal what we need to build before arriving at our intended destination.
