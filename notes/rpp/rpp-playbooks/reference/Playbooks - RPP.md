# Practice

## Governance & Operational Structure 

### Participants in the playbooks project

- Core Team

  - The RPP Core team manages the Reimagining Power treasury and is accountable to the project's stakeholders for delivery of its commitments. RPP Core team members are voting members of the cell who contribute to deliverables, but delegate their votes to a playbook steward unless actively involved in the day-to-day activities of the cell.

- Playbooks Cell Members 

  - Members of the Playbooks Cell have governance rights over the activities of the Cell making decisions over how the Cell coordinates the creation of playbooks. Cell members include: members of the RPP core team, playbooks stewards and other contributors how join the Cell. 

- Contributors

  - Essential to RPP's Playbook production capacity, Contributors, including Core Team members, make Playbooks a reality. Contributors bring their domain-specific expertise in order to help design, develop, and distribute Playbooks that are relevant, accessible, and actionable. "Contributors" includes anyone currently working on deliverables for the playbooks project.

- Funders

  - Funders provide grants to SuperBenefit to help finance Playbook production. Their generous donations are crucial to the long-term success of Playbooks by ensuring that Playbook contributors can be compensated for their work and that Playbooks can forever remain a free and open public good.

- Players

  - Playbook's intended audience. Players are individuals and organizations who use Playbooks to promote organizational effectiveness through the adoption and integration of Web3 technologies.

- Web3 Partners

  - A collection of a Web3 organizations that contribute to, consume, and/or build upon Playbooks. While Web3 partners are not a core Playbook stakeholder group, they contribute to the broader RP vision.

### **Structure**

1. Oversight - Administrative authority for the project sits with the RP core team, with Playbooks as a deliverable that the RP core team is contracted to deliver

2. The RPP core team delegates playbooks strategy and coordination to the Playbook Stewards who will maintain this parent task for the playbooks project as well as the [Operational Plan for Playbooks Project - RPP task](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/operational-plan-for-playbooks-project-rpp-03973760590487441).

3. Delivery of the Playbooks project will be managed by the Playbooks Cell. See below for the Playbooks Cell State which outlines all of the relevant governance and operational details about the project.  

## Playbooks Cell State

**_Note - editing this cell state doc is restricted to playbook stewards_**

_Note - this cell state follows the following template and instructions referred to in the [group state pattern](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/notes/rpp/working-docs/group-state.md) in the SuperBenefit knowledge garden_

**Cell name:** RPP Playbooks cell

**Date of creation:** 18/01/25 

**Description:**

This is an [ephemeral Cell ](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tags/ephemeral-cell.md) that is created to coordinate the delivery of artifacts for the playbooks project. 

## Purpose

**Purpose/problem**

Creating playbooks will require pulling together and coordinating contributors to work on them. 

Playbooks as we are designing them, are not single, separate pieces of work that can be done as individual tasks, instead the information architecture that we are building around the RPP in general, and the playbooks project specifically, requires interlinked sets of concepts, primitives and patterns. To deal with this complexity and the need for ongoing sense-making, contributors to the playbooks project need a place where they can collectively collaborate and coordinate around the work that needs to be done. 

To manage this we are creating an [ephemeral Cell](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tags/ephemeral-cell.md) that can be resourced and tasked with playbook delivery. 

**Genesis of the Cell**

This Cell was created by the RPP OS stewards and approved by the RPP Core team  

**Goals**

At a minimum to deliver the 2 playbooks that RPP is contracted to deliver as well as supporting research and accompanying knowledge artifacts 

**Design/intentions**

The Cell is set up as a moloch contract where contributors from within and from outside of the SuperBenefit network can coordinate/be coordinated to deliver the assets that the project needs. The Cell will be closed down and remaining funds returned to the RPP project when the playbooks project is complete. 

---

## Practice 

**Relationships**

- The Cell is created and funded by the RPP core team, via this proposal  

- It takes it's direction from the playbooks steward role holders who hold the strategy for the project

**Formal structure**

- The Cell is managed through a [Moloch ](https://admin.daohaus.club/#/molochv3/0xa/0xe80ffca045bf338cb088b8fb635130431ec6f976)contract

- This is administered through the [playbooks cell hat](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/30) worn by the Moloch's safe address: 0xe80ffca045bf338cb088b8fb635130431ec6f976

**Team agreements**

- RPP Core team has overall responsibility for the Cell

- Strategy and operational planning is delegated by the RPP core team to the [playbooks stewards](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/30?hatId=30.1.3.1.3), currently:

  - rathermercurial.eth

  - yeoro.eth

- The playbooks stewards will evolve the tasks in the [operational plan](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/operational-plan-for-playbooks-project-rpp-03973760590487441) in line with the needs and insights identified by the cell 

	

- Membership:

  - Members of the Cell (contributors) can be found in the [members list](https://admin.daohaus.club/#/molochv3/0xa/0xe80ffca045bf338cb088b8fb635130431ec6f976/members) of the moloch

  - Members can request to join the cell via governance proposal

  - Participation is optional. Contributors **do _not_** need to join the cell to complete tasks, propose, or participate in the chat

  - Note - if several people also want to join the cell, please ask a steward to create a batch proposal. This helps reduce voting fatigue.

- Tokens/governance

  - Individual human members may own 1 voting share across all of their wallets, and may transfer their share between their own wallets (honor system)

  - Members are encouraged to delegate their shares if they don't plan to a vote.

  - Members are expected to ragequit their voting shares if they don't plan to contribute in the foreseeable future

  - It is expected that the contract will only be used for token issuance but moloch v3 features are available if needed

  - Any member may hold any amount of loot tokens (non-voting shares) and do whatever they want with them, including trading or cashing out, permissionlessly, at any time.

  - Voting membership is not required for a contributor to receive and cash-out loot tokens

  - Governance parameters:

    - 1 Member, 1 Vote

    - Quorum: 30%, Threshold: 60%

    - Voting Period: 2 days

    - Grace Period: 1 day

  - Each cell member + members of the RPP core team gets one vote 

  - The RPP core team delegates its votes (currently to yeoro.eth) 

  - RPP rules require 48 hours feedback/notification period for all governance proposals

    - Please create a thread in the #RP-playbooks channel with your proposal for discussion

    - Surprise proposals to spend RPP funds are considered governance attacks (will probably ragequit and fail)

    - Stewards will check for new proposals daily EOD

- Support:

  - Playbook stewards are available to facilitate all governance matters

  - Help for contributors can also be requested through the #rp-core channel on Discord.

**Decision-making**

- The playbook stewards propose funding for the Cell to the RPP core team for approval

- Strategy decisions will be made by the playbook stewards and outlined in the tasks in the operational plan

- Working agreements and allocation of the tasks will be made by the [members](https://admin.daohaus.club/#/molochv3/0xa/0xe80ffca045bf338cb088b8fb635130431ec6f976/members) of the Cell

**Treasury management**

Multi-sig:

- Funds for the cell are held in Moloch's [safe contract](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=oeth:0x567297a3d07a093f1a0cf4aa4eada7c538b5f7f8): 0xe80ffca045bf338cb088b8fb635130431ec6f976

- Funds can be distributed using [a proposal](https://admin.daohaus.club/#/molochv3/0xa/0xe80ffca045bf338cb088b8fb635130431ec6f976/proposals), or by transferring loot tokens directly. However submitting a payment request to a steward is recommended instead.

- The RPP core team has ragequit rights and can pull remaining funds from the safe if it chooses

- When the playbooks project is complete the cell will be wound down and all remaining funds in the safe contract will be returned to the RPP project

	

Contributor rewards:

- The playbook stewards are responsible for funding tasks

- Rewards are allocated in the form of loot tokens (pbLoot)

- Contributors will submit a payment requests for tasks completed to be approved by the stewards
