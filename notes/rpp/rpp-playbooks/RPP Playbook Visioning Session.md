# Summary

The Visioning & Planning session for the Playbooks project focused on finalizing the strategy for creating playbooks, which would be a major output of the work done by the team over the past few months. The key goal of the meeting was to define the necessary components to produce the first playbook and create a roadmap for future playbook production.

Key points from the session:

1. **Meeting Structure and Purpose**: The meeting was framed around finalizing the visioning phase and preparing for playbook creation. The main goal was to align the team on the scope, structure, and goals for the first playbook, as well as setting a precedent for future playbooks. The group discussed how to organize and channel the creative and intellectual energy generated in earlier brainstorming sessions into a tangible product.

2. **Discovery Phase Recap:** The team reviewed themes from the discovery phase, including:


1. Activating energy: Leveraging the passion and ideas generated so far.

2. Telling the story: Ensuring that the playbooks accurately reflect the broader work of the team and the project.

3. Experimentation and productization: Approaching playbooks like products with specific purposes and audiences in mind.


1. **Playbook Goals and Scope**: There was significant discussion about the scope of the playbooks. Should the focus be narrow and deep, addressing specific problems for a particular audience, or should it be broader, covering multiple potential scenarios or patterns? The team leaned toward creating playbooks that are narrow in scope but deeply solve specific problems for particular types of organizations or stakeholders, especially in the philanthropic and social impact space.

2. **Practical Considerations:**


1. Structure of playbooks: The playbooks could contain multiple ‚Äúplays‚Äù that address different approaches to solving a problem. There was discussion on how many plays each playbook should contain and how to balance breadth versus depth.

2. Content delivery: The playbooks need to be user-friendly and easily distributable. While a basic Google Doc could work in a pinch, there was preference for more professional, polished formats, such as GitBook or similar platforms.


1. **Key Risks Identified:**


1. Team capacity: A recurring theme was the need to respect the team‚Äôs bandwidth and ensure realistic timeframes.

2. Prioritizing production: There was concern about focusing too much on processes and not enough on actually producing and shipping playbooks.


1. **Audience and Use Cases**: The team discussed who the playbooks are for, such as organizations in the philanthropic space looking to integrate Web3 technology into their grant processes. A recurring question was whether playbooks should focus on solving specific problems (like improving grant management) or be broader pattern libraries to inspire new use cases.

2. **Consultation and Translation Role**: The team acknowledged a potential translator role that Super Benefit could play, acting as a bridge between complex Web3 technology and its practical applications in sectors like philanthropy. The playbooks would need to be designed to help less tech-savvy users understand and implement Web3 solutions effectively.

3. **Next Steps:**


1. The playbooks need to move into a production phase where specific problems are addressed with a playbook tailored for that use case.

2. The production team needs to be cross-functional, including subject matter experts, content creators, and possibly designers to ensure that the playbooks are practical and user-friendly.

3. The importance of creating iterative processes for producing and refining playbooks was emphasized, ensuring continuous improvement over time.

In conclusion, the session aimed to align the team on the immediate goal of producing the first playbook, which would serve as both a proof of concept and a foundation for future playbook production. The team discussed logistical considerations, audience engagement, and how to ensure that the playbooks deliver real-world utility, particularly in the philanthropic sector.

Minutesüìù Playbooks Planning and Visioning Session Notesüïû Started at 03:01 PM on 09 Sep, lasted 1h 59mVisioning and Planning Session for Reimagining Power Project (RPP)The meeting focused on developing playbooks, with the primary goal of beginning roadmapping for the first playbook and articulating the components needed to create it.This session aimed to provide necessary information for creating a detailed project plan for the next phase, considering all aspects of RPP.The outcome would feed into a final report, including a project charter, stakeholder registry, risk registry, and recommendations for moving forward.Key Themes from Discovery InterviewsFour key themes were identified: activating energy, telling the story, experimentation, and playbooks as projects.The group demonstrated passion and deep critical thinking, producing great potential energy that now needs to be channeled into playbooks.Telling the story involves communicating complex ideas of RPP both internally and externally, with playbooks serving as crucial artifacts in this narrative.RPP is viewed as a lab, with playbooks representing research findings or recommendations.The approach to playbooks is similar to product development, focusing on being purpose-built, user-driven, and designed to solve specific problems.Vision for the Next Three MonthsThe group's vision includes shipping the first playbook, having experiments well underway, creating stronger feedback loops between experiments and playbooks, developing defined standards and templates for playbook production, and improving community operations.Risks identified include constraints on team capacity, the need to disambiguate between program-level roles and playbook production roles, the potential for prioritizing process over production, and a lack of clarity in the definition and purpose of playbooks both internally and externally.Hypothetical Scenario ExerciseA hypothetical scenario was presented where the team had 48 hours to produce a playbook, aiming to identify necessary inputs, required skills and knowledge, and potential topics for the playbook.The group discussed the need for clarity on scope, the importance of leveraging existing work, and potential challenges in connecting different pieces of work into a cohesive playbook.Defining Playbooks and Their PurposeThe group grappled with defining what a playbook is and its purpose, discussing whether playbooks are discrete pieces of content for specific audiences or more of a process.The consensus leaned towards playbooks being a combination of both - a resource that can be picked up and used by others but also potentially facilitated by Super Benefit members or others in the ecosystem.The group agreed that playbooks should be shareable via URL, branded to some degree, and potentially hosted on platforms like Gitbook.Intended Audience for PlaybooksThe team discussed whether playbooks should be designed for complete Web3 novices or individuals with some knowledge of Web3 concepts and tools.They debated whether playbooks should be self-service resources or require facilitation by Super Benefit members or others.The group leaned towards creating resources that could eventually be used independently but might initially require facilitation.Playbooks as Non-Revenue SourcesThe team clarified that playbooks are not intended to be a direct revenue source for Super Benefit.While individual members might use playbooks in consulting work, the organization itself is not relying on playbooks for funding.Instead, playbooks are seen as a way to showcase Super Benefit's work and potentially attract future project opportunities or funding.Reasons for Creating PlaybooksThe purpose of creating playbooks is to share what's possible in terms of Web3 solutions for social impact and philanthropy.Playbooks aim to showcase problems that can be solved through Web3 technologies.They seek to make Web3 concepts more accessible and provide practical ways to experiment with them.Creating a resource for community organizers facing challenges is another goal.The intention is to provide practical examples, be transparent about learning, and inspire others.Finally, playbooks aim to bridge the gap between emergent possibilities in Web3 and practical action for organizations trying to do good.Further Defining Plays and PlaybooksThe team discussed the need to further define what constitutes a play versus a playbook and how to structure these elements.They considered the idea of plays being smaller units that combine into larger playbooks.The group expressed interest in potentially organizing a focused session to work on producing a playbook together.Finally, they acknowledged the need to establish clearer constraints and definitions around playbooks to guide future work.
