For the purposes of developing playbooks as part of the RP project, we need to embark on several research and design tasks. This parent task will hold and manage these different research and design components of the playbooks project. 

### **1. Creating a high-level playbook design **for RPP

1. In the RPP we will be developing "playbooks" to do this we first need to create our own definition of what a playbook is... who it is for, how it is structured, how people will use it etc

2. This task will involve researching existing web3 playbook projects and outlining the common patterns that appear in these projects as a set of knowledge resources that can be used by other working on the RP playbooks and beyond. 


1.  


1. Then develop these into a high-level design template for RP playbooks - based on the specific needs of the RP playbooks project (its purpose, goals and specific context as expressed in the Discovery Report)

 

1. Gain feedback from the core team and other contributors on this and iterate the high-level design into a final (but light-weight) deliverable. 

2. Collect research material and links and collate them as playbook resources for use by other designers in the playbook project.

### **2. Collecting and creating playbook design resources**

1. Researching existing playbook libraries, design examples, schemas, frameworks etc (leveraging the research done in the task above)

2. Cataloging useful resources that exist that will help those who are working on individual playbooks 

3. Flesh out DAO primitive and necessary docs in the Knowledge base/garden
    

4. Building out the necessary playbook terms in the lexicon
