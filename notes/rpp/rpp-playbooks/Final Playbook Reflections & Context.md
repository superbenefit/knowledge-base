## Playbook Context Braindump

### 1. Strategic Foundation (10 minutes)

"DAO Cell and Community Governance" playbook is the mandate, but we can expand on that, or create other playbooks

**Problem Definition**

- **What specific challenge does this playbook address?**

  -  help people in the social impact space to use web3 tools to grow participation, ownership, transparency, resilience and impact

  -  rm: Help stakeholders understand what was done, what memes & tech were used, & how to communicate that

  -  Filsan: How different stakeholders can create a form of governance that it collaborative. How web3 tools/mechanisms can make this easier/more efficient.

  -  Michelle: share the path and story of the RPP project; share the learning, frameworks and tech that were explored and the experiments to test these hypotheses; offer a roadmap that is not linear but has patterns for those who want to under both theoretically and in practice

  - Ananth: gets people from 0 -> 1 (or even 0.5) on approaching onchain organizations and how they might want to start building one out. 

- **What happens when organizations tackle this without guidance?**

  - end up on the wrong chain using wrong tools

  - get scammed or phished

  - end up repeating old hierarchies

  - organizational bureaucracies block progress

  - Endless sensemaking, scope creed, extended timelines, incomplete projects

  -  Filsan: The same issues looking to be addressed are re-created (power/decision making is top-down)

  -  michelle: they can create or replicate the very systems they are trying to change; they bring In people and groups that don't have the readiness and they spend more time thinking and talking about the challenges instead of testing; the mainstream messaging of the corruption rises up as dominant rather than community centered values being primary; they get overwhelmed by the tech and don't get to see the impacts

  -  rm: adoptees reproduce common mistakes, bring old (unhelpful) patterns of organizing, fail to plan their system around technical constraints

  - Ananth: they build out their orgs in ways that they don't actually want to and have to pivot in the future which becomes messy

- **Why does this need a playbook vs. just pointing to patterns?**

  -  with little experience, it's hard to know how patterns fit together and what they can achieve when used a certain way

  - provide reassu that particular problems rance 

  -  michelle: a playbook will be more comprehensive and could be iterative and added to, it could share the origin story, lore of the project, failures, what questions we are left pondering, how web3 shifted during the project; it can have the sociaI impact essence and tech essence to speak to various audiences and be a bridge. 

  -  Filsan: Having an example from start to finish would be helpful for many orgs, particularly non-profits with limited resources and capacity.

  -  rm: IRL nonprofits astablished way to do thatre an emerging use case, so tradspace readers won't know how to relate dweb knowledge into their work / worldview

    - Our audience uses jargon and liberal ontologies which may not be innately compatible with the languauge and ideas used in the patterns and case studies.

  - Ananth: gives more structure than just giving people a wiki and telling them to start here and explore. 

**Core Theory/Approach**

- **What's our fundamental belief about how change happens in this domain?**

  -  

  -  

  - Filsan: Partners coming together with guidance on what's possible, with clear/shared principles

  - A small brave group does a 'crazy' experiment/pilot and that inspires others in the org/network to follow

  - Michelle: in any new innovation cycle, you need those willing to sit in the mess, figure things out, iterate, fail and come back to it; see and document patters and find ways to bridge it for others; we need use cases/experiments and documentation to hook people into how power can shift and why collaborative governance and community centered approaches can shift money and value flows; you have to be in the technology not just read about it

  - : people feel equipped enough that they go in with a plan instead of feeling like they're constantly figuring out thguide our approach?

- **What 3-5 principles guide our approach?**

  -  composability, transparency, solidarity

  -  Filsan: Regenerative, collaborative, transparency, equity-centered

  -  Michelle: equity, sovereignty, community centered, open and transparent

  - Ananth: clarity, actionability, cohesiveness

- **What's our unique perspective or insight?** 

  -  minimum viable permissionless

  - different organizational scales require different approaches

  - we are bridging worlds and sectors

  - to shift power we need to be inside and outside systems/insitutions

  - collaborative governance requires a stick-to-itness and follow through from a core team

  - local to global provides a diversity of perspectives, skills, assets 

  - Bridging experiences from diff sectors

  - 

  - Ananth: we've made a lot of structures that are generally reusable instead of something that's trying to keep one specific org afloat at that moment

**Success Vision**

- What becomes possible when this playbook is successfully implemented?

  -  Impact measurement methods/reporting becomes decentralized/on blockchain

  - Capital distribution is more equitable

  - Capacity pains of social impact/philanthropy orgs are reduced with use of web3 tech/systems

  - Communities can be active participants in capital distributions as web3/DAO voting mechanisms are implemented 

  - social purpose organizations feel comfortable about using web3 technologies. 

  - grow the SuperBenefit network 100x

  - major foundations move all their granting and impact reporting on-chain

  -  Some social impact organizations fundamentally shift the way they mobilize, distribute and invest capital and governance; other groups form of mutually aligned people to solve community problems and create regenerativeprojects independent of organizations

  - foundations, nonprofits and social impact orgs have data sovereignty, open source as much data as they can while keeping privacy, and track and share impact on chain and openly

  - there is an understanding there is not a tech tool that can meet all needs and creating tech stacks to meet the unique needs is recognized 

  - ananth: they're able to take whatever theory of change we're going with and apply it so that they can make what they want

- How do we define success for users of this playbook?

  -  They are able to understand, and implement the approaches/systems presented in the playbook. And that they find it impactful

  -  social purpose organizations feel comfortable about using web3 technologies

  -  the language and playbook can be understood and seen as stellar by both social impact practitioners and techies

  -

### 2. Audience & Context (10 minutes)

**Primary Audience**

- Role/position and organizational context

  - Filsan: President/CEOs (Foundations, Impact Investment Firms), program design departments, governance committee chairs/members, Fund managers, Impact Investment advisors/consultants, teachers/professors

  - ED/COO/CTO/Program Manager (someone with decision-making authority) in a community group, non-profit, foundation, impact fund, central/local government department, government agency, food bank, mutual aid network, etc

  - 

  - rm: workers in capacity-building or facilitation roles in their social purpose org/industry facilitating tech adoption journeys from an ethical POV

  - michelle: ED/Finance/Tech/Fund Development/Impact Investing/Impact Measurement & Monitoring, Learning Eval Teams/governance teams/impact consultants

  - Michelle: Nonprofits, charities, social enterprise, co-ops, grassroot groups, foundations, social purpose biz, social innovation practitioners, impact investment/fund managers

  - ananth:?

- Experience level with these concepts

  - 

  - between 2-4 out of 5. the sweet spot is someone who has a wallet and is curious and excited about blockchain but doesn't have experience or knowledge of how to use web3 tools in a social impact context. also someone who is a '5' who can help refine and add to our patterns and plays :)

  - 

  - 

  - rm: Most audiences will have little or basic understanding of decentralized technologies, but most will probably be familiar with nonprofit industry knowledge and trendy themes

  - ananth:?

- Key constraints (time, resources, authority)

  - Filsan: time, open to diff/new systems, 

  - time, bureaucracy, fear of the unknown

  - Michelle: time, logics/mindsets around tech abilities; reputation of tech; 

  - 

  - rm: time, mental bandwidth / complexity overwhelm, remembering lots of jargon or abstract concepts, varying degrees of authority and/or peer buy-in

  - ananth: time, patience

- Language preferences and terminology to avoid

  - I like the "From Technical to Mission-Aligned Language" section in [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bf_RVdQQJgXXhaQ8aVKAy4RIkpqLrDDzRwf9LiA5QXI/edit?tab=t.0). Although arguably in places it has swapped web3 jargon for philanthropy jargon! Keep the language as simple as possible - Grade 9 level or something like that. - + 1 Grade 9 language

  - Anything that might cause harm and feels exclusionary

  - 

  - rm: Crypto "degen" jargon and typical crypto culture / extractive behavior, software development language,  - + 1 the crypto

  - ananth:?

**Implementation Context**

- When/why would they seek this guidance?

  - They want to find ways to increase impact in a transparent way

  - When they are tired of the time intensive systems they use

  - they want a better (cheaper, faster, transparent, censorship-resistant) way to distribute funds to global partners

  - they face the challenge of capital projects not being maintained because the community hasn't been given real ownership of the infrastructure

  - they see the potential of growing new forms of value flows, which can shift global power systems

  - they want better (faster, distributed, transparent, permanent, verifiable, rewardable) ways to track impact 

  - they have heard about the web3/blockchain/emerging tech space and how others in social impact are finding promising pathways to reimagine capital and power for community led futures and they want to see something that has some depth and examples

  - rm: organizations are often talking about a need to shift dependencies away from state/corporate controlled systems which may be unreliable during political unrest, changing economic conditions are spurring the need for alternative value flows. Our audien

  - ananth:?

- Where do stakeholders/projects typically get stuck?

  - Filsan: How decisions are made, continuing momentum, continued interest of decision makers within stakeholder orgs

  - 

  - typically get stuck before they get started! because of information overload, fearmongering, decision paralysis, and/or lack of clear guidance and support. or get stuck getting the organization on board.

  - uncertainty around on-ramping and wallet safety

  - finding peers/mentors to support he journey

  - 

  - michelle: having to get team buy in across multiple stakeholders in an org/project/collab; media has created a tentativeness around tech and the usability still has a ways to go to be for the many not the few

  - ananth:?

### 3. Content Strategy (To be filled in later \~ Just add things in here if you feel inclined)

**Pattern Organization Logic**

- How should patterns be grouped for this audience? (by phase, function, complexity?)

  - Community Governance

  - Operational Governance 

  - Multi-stakeholder Governance 

- Which patterns are core vs. optional?

  - Coordi-nations 

  - Peer to peer payments

  - DAOs, cells, roles, tasks

  - Local nodes

  - token based governance 

  - Group state

  - 

  - 

  - 

**Tone & Approach**

- How detailed vs. high-level should guidance be?

  - medium. some of the playbooks i've seen are so high-level that they're essentially useless unless you already know 

  - 

  - 

  - 

  - 

  - 

  - 

- What tone works best for this audience?

  - 

  - 

  - 

  - 

  - 

  - 

- What examples would be most compelling?

  - 

  - 

  - 

  -

  - 

  - 

  - 

  - 

  - 

- What SuperBenefit values/approaches should be emphasized?

  - 

  -

### 4. Implementation Pathways (To be filled in later)

**Different Approaches**

  - 

  - 

  - 

  - 

  - 

  - 

- What factors should influence pathway choice?

  - 

  - 

  - 

  - 

  - 

  - 

- How do we balance comprehensive guidance with adaptability?

  - 

  - 

  - 

  - 

  - 

  - 

**Support Strategy**

- Where do people need the most help?

  - Practical implementation of tools, patterns, etc..

    - We're creating guides to help people understand how to implement governance patterns for each pattern grouping. They can be linked in the playbook to abstract away implementation details for easier reading and writing.

    - These guides should be useful in understanding how they might approach decentralized governance, but readers who want to start implementing the patterns should still probably engage an experienced facilitator to help, and/or reach out to SuperBenefit for guidance.

  - Deciphering technical jargon

    - A common complaint about learning these topics is difficulty with arcane language and technical jargon. 

      - The lexicon (the `/tags/`directory in the knowledge base/garden) can and should be used to abstract away complex ideas and definition of terms. Playbook language should be simple, while providing links to more information wherever possible.

      - New lexicon entries (AKA tag pages) can and should be used where no appropriate entries exist, using the [tag creation workflow](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tools/workflows/lexicon/tag-creation-workflow.md). Content should be updated as needed using the [tag update workflow](https://github.com/superbenefit/knowledge-base/blob/main/tools/workflows/lexicon/tag-update-workflow.md).
