# Implementation Paths: Deep Context for Playbook Development

## Path 1: Collaborative Learning Journey

### Definition and Core Principles

A Collaborative Learning Journey is a facilitated group learning experience focused on emergence, sensemaking, collective intelligence, inspiration, human connection, and effective adoption of practices and social technologies. These journeys create the social foundation necessary for governance transformation by building relationships, shared language, and collective understanding across diverse stakeholder groups.

Unlike traditional training or conferences, these journeys feature participants with intentionally different backgrounds—technologists with community organizers, funders with practitioners, Web3 developers with grassroots leaders. This diversity fosters what AIFS participants called "productive tension," generating insights impossible within homogeneous groups.

Journeys typically span several months to years, coordinated by facilitators who host gatherings, share materials, and nurture connections. The Reimagining Power Project itself used this approach through 18 months of stakeholder convenings to maintain cohesion among SuperBenefit, AIFS, ICS, Equality Fund, and OTF as they pursued diverse experiments.

### The AIFS Model: Evidence from Practice

All In For Sport's DAO Salon Series exemplifies this approach. Over six months, they hosted six gatherings bringing together 111 participants from 38 organizations spanning sport, technology, community development, and philanthropy. This created a living laboratory where collective intelligence emerged through structured yet organic interactions.

#### Key Design Elements

**Participatory Curriculum Design**: AIFS began with Session 0, using participatory methods to co-create curriculum based on community needs. Their retrospective notes: "We executed our gatherings with a participatory design approach. Based on feedback from Session 0, we built a curriculum that was iterative and responsive to emerging community needs."

**Structured Emergence**: Each 90-minute gathering balanced consistency with flexibility—opening rituals, topic presentations, case study discussions, and closing connections. The middle 40 minutes dedicated to peer problem-solving proved most valuable, where organizations shared challenges and received collective input.

**Multi-Modal Documentation**: AIFS employed "poetic harvesting" alongside traditional documentation, capturing emotional and aspirational dimensions of conversations. One participant reflected: "Poetic Harvesting touched me, I'm glad of spirit it embodies into the activity." These creative artifacts made insights accessible to broader audiences and created shareable touchstones for the community.

**Cross-Sector Bridge Building**: The gatherings brought together Web3 developers and grassroots sports organizations. One developer reflected: "I came thinking I had solutions. I learned I barely understood the problems." This humility emerged from structured dialogue across difference.

#### Documented Impact

The journey produced concrete results beyond knowledge transfer. Two projects received Giveth funding through connections made at gatherings: Every Court Can Dream (basketball court revitalization) and Huottoja University (indigenous knowledge preservation). AIFS was selected for IOC Tech365 Explorer program, coordinating 25 organizations across 16 countries. They established a Women Win partnership for Web3 exploration and created lasting infrastructure through Discord, LinkedIn communities, and a video archive at watch.allinforsport.org.

The retrospective revealed important learnings. Only about 10% of volunteers initially engaged with Web3 tools, suggesting realistic expectations for adoption rates. The team noted they "didn't originally know the level of knowledge that those attending would come with" and adjusted after discovering initial content was too advanced. This responsiveness proved crucial for sustained engagement.

### Design Principles from Evidence

**Start with Emergence, Not Answers**: AIFS's evolution toward identifying as "coordination infrastructure" emerged during the gatherings rather than being predetermined. This openness to discovery characterizes effective journeys.

**Documentation as Practice**: Poetic harvesting, recordings, and multi-platform capture create shared memory and enable asynchronous participation. Documentation becomes a living resource generating ongoing value.

**Relationships Before Solutions**: The primary outcome isn't knowledge transfer but relationship building. Projects emerging months after gatherings concluded demonstrate the lasting value of these connections.

**Facilitation as Choreography**: Participants appreciated the "jazz-like coordination" that enabled productive sessions. Structure enables rather than constrains improvisation.

### Implementation Guidance

**When to Consider This Approach**: Collaborative Learning Journeys work best when multiple stakeholder groups need shared understanding, the problem space is complex without clear solutions, relationship building matters as much as knowledge transfer, or cross-sector collaboration could unlock new possibilities.

**Resource Requirements**: AIFS's 6-month journey with monthly gatherings provides a baseline. Budget for skilled facilitation, multi-platform infrastructure (recording, transcription, creative documentation), and coordination capacity. The AIFS team emphasized that "internal team cohesion, trust, and sense of shared purpose" among organizers was essential.

**Managing Expectations**: Organizations must prepare for emergent rather than predetermined outcomes. AIFS discovered that focusing on "enjoyable experiences rather than technical training" produced better engagement than didactic approaches.

### Challenges and Adaptations

The AIFS retrospective identified several challenges. Social media impact was minimal despite effort—"our twitter had 0 impact on this round." Sustaining engagement between sessions proved difficult with "not much ongoing conversation on Discord outside of the gatherings." The team wished for more involvement from funders, noting "lack of engagement feels a bit like old patterns of funders not seeing themselves in the 'work' and 'community'."

These challenges suggest adaptations: design for sustained engagement between gatherings, set realistic expectations about digital participation, and explicitly invite funders into the learning process rather than expecting automatic engagement.

### The Journey as Foundation

Collaborative Learning Journeys provide more than a method for exploring governance transformation—they create the relational infrastructure necessary for any meaningful change. As AIFS discovered, the journey format builds trust, shared language, and collective capacity that enables implementation of other governance patterns.

The evidence suggests these journeys work because they honor the human pace of change. Technical solutions become useful only within social contexts of trust and shared understanding. By investing in collaborative learning journeys, organizations build foundations that make all other transformation possible.
