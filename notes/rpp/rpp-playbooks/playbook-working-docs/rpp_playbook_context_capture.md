# DAO Cell and Community Governance Playbook - Context Capture

*Collaborative session output - January 2025*

---

## Strategic Foundation

### Problem Statement
Help people in the social impact space use web3 tools to grow participation, ownership, transparency, resilience and impact. The playbook addresses how different stakeholders can create collaborative governance using web3 tools/mechanisms to make it easier and more efficient. It shares the path and story of the RPP project, including learning, frameworks, tech exploration, and experiments, offering a roadmap that has patterns for those who want to understand both theoretically and in practice. Gets people from 0 â†’ 1 (or even 0.5) on approaching onchain organizations and how they might want to start building one out.

### What Happens Without Guidance
- End up on the wrong chain using wrong tools
- Get scammed or phished  
- End up repeating old hierarchies and recreating the same top-down power/decision-making systems they are trying to change
- Organizational bureaucracies block progress
- Endless sensemaking, scope creep, extended timelines, incomplete projects
- Bring in people and groups that don't have readiness, spending more time thinking and talking about challenges instead of testing
- Mainstream messaging of corruption rises as dominant rather than community-centered values being primary
- Get overwhelmed by the tech and don't get to see the impacts
- Adoptees reproduce common mistakes, bring old (unhelpful) patterns of organizing
- Fail to plan their system around technical constraints
- Build out their orgs in ways they don't actually want and have to pivot later, which becomes messy

### Why Playbook vs Just Patterns
- With little experience, it's hard to know how patterns fit together and what they can achieve when used a certain way
- Provides reassurance that particular problems can be solved
- More comprehensive and iterative, can share origin story, lore of the project, failures, questions left pondering
- Shows how web3 shifted during the project
- Has both social impact essence and tech essence to speak to various audiences and be a bridge
- Having an example from start to finish would be helpful for many orgs, particularly nonprofits with limited resources and capacity
- IRL nonprofits are an emerging use case, so traditional space readers won't know how to relate dweb knowledge into their work/worldview
- Our audience uses jargon and liberal ontologies which may not be innately compatible with language and ideas used in patterns and case studies
- Gives more structure than just giving people a wiki and telling them to start here and explore

### Core Theory
**How Change Happens:** Partners coming together with guidance on what's possible, with clear/shared principles. A small brave group does a 'crazy' experiment/pilot that inspires others in the org/network to follow. In any new innovation cycle, you need those willing to sit in the mess, figure things out, iterate, fail and come back to it; see and document patterns and find ways to bridge it for others. Need use cases/experiments and documentation to hook people into how power can shift and why collaborative governance and community-centered approaches can shift money and value flows. You have to be in the technology not just read about it. People feel equipped enough that they go in with a plan instead of feeling like they're constantly figuring things out.

### Guiding Principles
- **Composability, transparency, solidarity**
- **Regenerative, collaborative, transparency, equity-centered**  
- **Equity, sovereignty, community centered, open and transparent**
- **Clarity, actionability, cohesiveness**

### Unique Perspective
- Minimum viable permissionless approach
- Different organizational scales require different approaches  
- Bridging worlds and sectors
- To shift power we need to be inside and outside systems/institutions
- Collaborative governance requires stick-to-itness and follow through from a core team
- Local to global provides diversity of perspectives, skills, assets
- Bridging experiences from different sectors
- Made a lot of structures that are generally reusable instead of something trying to keep one specific org afloat at that moment

### Success Vision
**What Becomes Possible:**
- Impact measurement methods/reporting becomes decentralized/on blockchain
- Capital distribution is more equitable
- Capacity pains of social impact/philanthropy orgs are reduced with use of web3 tech/systems
- Communities can be active participants in capital distributions as web3/DAO voting mechanisms are implemented
- Social purpose organizations feel comfortable about using web3 technologies
- Grow the SuperBenefit network 100x
- Major foundations move all their granting and impact reporting on-chain
- Some social impact organizations fundamentally shift the way they mobilize, distribute and invest capital and governance
- Other groups form of mutually aligned people to solve community problems and create regenerative projects independent of organizations
- Foundations, nonprofits and social impact orgs have data sovereignty, open source as much data as they can while keeping privacy, and track and share impact on chain and openly
- Understanding there is not a tech tool that can meet all needs and creating tech stacks to meet unique needs is recognized
- They're able to take whatever theory of change we're going with and apply it so that they can make what they want

**Success Metrics for Users:**
- Able to understand and implement the approaches/systems presented in the playbook and find it impactful
- The language and playbook can be understood and seen as stellar by both social impact practitioners and techies

## Audience Profile

### Primary Audience
**Roles/Positions:**
- President/CEOs (Foundations, Impact Investment Firms)
- Program design departments, governance committee chairs/members
- Fund managers, Impact Investment advisors/consultants, teachers/professors
- ED/COO/CTO/Program Manager (someone with decision-making authority) in: community group, non-profit, foundation, impact fund, central/local government department, government agency, food bank, mutual aid network
- Workers in capacity-building or facilitation roles in their social purpose org/industry facilitating tech adoption journeys from an ethical POV
- ED/Finance/Tech/Fund Development/Impact Investing/Impact Measurement & Monitoring, Learning Eval Teams/governance teams/impact consultants

**Organizational Context:**
- Nonprofits, charities, social enterprise, co-ops, grassroot groups, foundations, social purpose biz, social innovation practitioners, impact investment/fund managers

### Experience Level
Between 2-4 out of 5. The sweet spot is someone who has a wallet and is curious and excited about blockchain but doesn't have experience or knowledge of how to use web3 tools in a social impact context. Also someone who is a '5' who can help refine and add to our patterns and plays. Most audiences will have little or basic understanding of decentralized technologies, but most will probably be familiar with nonprofit industry knowledge and trendy themes.

### Key Constraints
- **Time constraints and competing priorities** - consistently mentioned across all respondents
- **Bureaucracy, fear of the unknown**
- **Logics/mindsets around tech abilities; reputation of tech**
- **Mental bandwidth/complexity overwhelm**
- **Remembering lots of jargon or abstract concepts**
- **Varying degrees of authority and/or peer buy-in**
- **Open to diff/new systems**

### Language Preferences
- **Preferred:** Grade 9 level language, keep language as simple as possible
- **Avoid:** Crypto "degen" jargon and typical crypto culture/extractive behavior, software development language, anything that might cause harm and feels exclusionary
- Reference "From Technical to Mission-Aligned Language" approach (though noted it swapped web3 jargon for philanthropy jargon in places)

### Implementation Context

**When/Why They Seek Guidance:**
- Want to find ways to increase impact in a transparent way
- When tired of time-intensive systems they currently use
- Want better (cheaper, faster, transparent, censorship-resistant) way to distribute funds to global partners
- Face challenge of capital projects not being maintained because community hasn't been given real ownership of infrastructure
- See potential of growing new forms of value flows, which can shift global power systems
- Want better (faster, distributed, transparent, permanent, verifiable, rewardable) ways to track impact
- Have heard about web3/blockchain/emerging tech space and how others in social impact are finding promising pathways to reimagine capital and power for community-led futures and want to see something with depth and examples
- Organizations talking about need to shift dependencies away from state/corporate controlled systems which may be unreliable during political unrest
- Changing economic conditions spurring need for alternative value flows

**Where They Typically Get Stuck:**
- How decisions are made, continuing momentum, continued interest of decision makers within stakeholder orgs
- Get stuck before they even start due to information overload, media-driven fearmongering, decision paralysis, and lack of clear guidance, combined with tech usability barriers that still have ways to go to be for the many not the few
- Getting organizational and multi-stakeholder buy-in across teams, projects, and collaborations
- Uncertainty around on-ramping and wallet safety
- Finding peers/mentors to support the journey
