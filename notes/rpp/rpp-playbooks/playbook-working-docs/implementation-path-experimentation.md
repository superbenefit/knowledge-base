# Implementation Path: Experimentation

## Definition and Core Principles

**Experimentation** involves discovering an organization's actual needs around the distribution of power, identifying viable intervention paths, and implementing carefully-scoped systems change to identify opportunities for effective adoption in a risk-controlled environment. Unlike traditional strategic planning that assumes problems are known and solutions can be predetermined, experimentation acknowledges uncertainty and uses structured discovery to reveal both real challenges and viable responses.

This path recognizes that organizations often misunderstand their own power dynamics and that assumed problems frequently differ from actual barriers. Through controlled experiments with defined scope, timeline, and risk parameters, organizations can test hypotheses about governance transformation while maintaining operational stability. The approach values learning over implementation success—a "failed" experiment that reveals critical prerequisites provides more value than forced adoption of inappropriate solutions.

## Evidence from Practice

### AIFS: Discovering Purpose Through Experimentation

All In For Sport began with a clear hypothesis: NFT sales could revolutionize grassroots sports funding. Eight months of experimentation revealed this assumption was fundamentally flawed. Traditional philanthropists viewed blockchain as unnecessary complexity while crypto-native funders saw the pivot away from NFTs as abandoning innovation. The organization couldn't articulate clear value to either constituency.

**Discovery Process**: Rather than persisting with a failing model, AIFS used the Reimagining Power Project to systematically explore alternatives. They implemented two parallel experiments:
- Gatherings series (6 sessions, 111 participants) to understand stakeholder needs
- Governance transformation (AIFSIP-04) to restructure decision-making

**Key Finding**: AIFS's value lay not in direct service provision but as coordination infrastructure connecting Web3 innovation with grassroots sports development. The experiment succeeded by revealing the organization needed to fundamentally reconceptualize its purpose.

**Risk Management**: By maintaining existing operations while experimenting with new models, AIFS avoided organizational collapse while discovering its true value proposition.

### ICS: Testing Governance Tools with Controlled Scope

The Institute for Community Sustainability entered experimentation with clearer problems: governance bottlenecks limiting growth, volunteers lacking meaningful participation, and funding uncertainty. Their hypothesis was that Web3 governance tools could address these challenges.

**Controlled Implementation**: ICS limited initial adoption to four core team members rather than attempting organization-wide transformation. They established:
- Multisignature wallet with 2-of-4 approval structure
- Hats Protocol for role management
- CharmVerse and Snapshot for collaborative decision-making
- Green Pill London chapter connecting to global movement

**Adaptive Approach**: When planned workshops proved misaligned with community readiness, ICS pivoted to a cohort model. This "opportunistic adoption" pattern—responding to emergent opportunities rather than forcing predetermined plans—yielded unexpected successes like top 10% Gitcoin Grants ranking.

**Critical Discovery**: Communities primarily sought participation in decision-making rather than new funding mechanisms. This insight fundamentally reoriented ICS's approach from resource acquisition to enabling agency.

### Equality Fund: Learning Through Non-Implementation

Equality Fund's experiment tested whether blockchain could reduce transaction costs and increase accessibility for international grant-making. The careful planning process itself generated the key discoveries.

**Hypothesis Testing**: The team assumed high fees between organizations created barriers. Through systematic discovery examining transaction data, they found: "personally I heard a lot about how expensive it is to move money around world, surprise... was not surprising that EF/WW move money without fees."

**Actual Barriers Discovered**: 
- Last-mile delivery challenges with local banking restrictions
- Hyper-local variation (city-by-city differences, not country-level)
- Innovation work cannot succeed as add-on responsibilities
- Partnership complexity grows geometrically with each organization

**Value of "Failed" Experiments**: Despite completing zero blockchain transactions, the experiment provided crucial insights preventing larger failures. Understanding prerequisites proved more valuable than forced implementation.

## Design Principles for Experimentation

### 1. Question Assumptions, Not Just Solutions

All three experiments discovered their initial hypotheses were wrong. AIFS wasn't meant to sell NFTs. ICS's community didn't primarily want funding access. Equality Fund's partners didn't face high transaction costs. Successful experimentation designs tests to surface actual problems rather than assuming them.

### 2. Scope for Learning, Not Just Success

ICS's decision to start with four core users rather than organization-wide adoption enabled genuine learning without existential risk. Equality Fund's plan to test with ~$100 revealed regulatory and operational challenges that larger experiments would have encountered catastrophically. Scope experiments to generate maximum learning with minimum risk.

### 3. Create Parallel Tracks

AIFS ran Gatherings while developing governance proposals. ICS built technical infrastructure while cultivating community relationships. Multiple experiments allow comparison and prevent over-investment in single approaches.

### 4. Document Everything

The value of these experiments extends beyond their organizations through systematic documentation. Discovery reports, reflection sessions, and case studies transform individual learning into collective knowledge. Documentation during experimentation, not after, captures insights that would otherwise be lost.

### 5. Embrace Productive Failure

"Failed" experiments often provide the most valuable insights. Equality Fund's non-implementation revealed critical prerequisites. AIFS's NFT abandonment enabled transformation into coordination infrastructure. Design experiments where learning value doesn't depend on implementation success.

## When to Use Experimentation

This path suits organizations experiencing:

- **Persistent challenges** that resist traditional solutions
- **Uncertainty** about root causes of organizational limitations  
- **Stakeholder frustration** with current power distributions
- **Openness to fundamental change** rather than incremental adjustment
- **Capacity for controlled risk** through defined scope and timeline

Experimentation works poorly when organizations seek predetermined outcomes, cannot tolerate temporary ambiguity, or lack resources for proper documentation and reflection.

## Implementation Framework

### Phase 1: Discovery (2-3 months)

**Systematic Problem Exploration**: Examine assumed challenges through stakeholder consultation, data analysis, and pattern recognition. AIFS discovered through gatherings that their value proposition confusion reflected deeper identity issues. Equality Fund's transaction analysis revealed assumed problems didn't exist.

**Hypothesis Development**: Based on discovery findings, develop testable hypotheses about interventions. ICS hypothesized that Web3 tools could enable distributed decision-making. These hypotheses should be specific enough to test but flexible enough to evolve.

**Risk Assessment**: Identify what could go wrong and design safeguards. ICS limited initial implementation to core team. Equality Fund separated experiments from actual fund disbursement. Define acceptable failure modes before beginning.

### Phase 2: Design (1-2 months)

**Scope Definition**: Establish clear boundaries for experiments. Number of participants, amount of resources, timeline, and success metrics. AIFS defined 6 gatherings over 6 months. ICS targeted 3+ active governance users. Constraints enable creativity.

**Pattern Selection**: Choose intervention patterns based on discovered needs rather than available tools. AIFS selected Gatherings and governance transformation. ICS chose technical infrastructure patterns. Equality Fund focused on peer-to-peer payments. Match patterns to actual problems.

**Resource Mobilization**: Secure necessary human, technical, and financial resources. All three experiments required skilled facilitation, documentation support, and participant time. Equality Fund's experience showed innovation cannot succeed as add-on work—dedicated resources are essential.

### Phase 3: Implementation (3-6 months)

**Iterative Execution**: Run experiments with built-in adaptation points. ICS's "opportunistic adoption" exemplified this—pivoting from workshops to cohorts based on community feedback. AIFS adjusted gathering formats based on participant needs. Rigidity kills experimentation.

**Continuous Documentation**: Capture insights during implementation, not just after. Meeting notes, participant feedback, and observed patterns all provide data. The RPP's emphasis on documentation enabled these case studies to benefit others.

**Stakeholder Communication**: Regular updates maintain trust during uncertainty. AIFS's governance proposal process kept community informed. Transparency about both successes and challenges builds credibility for continued experimentation.

### Phase 4: Assessment (1-2 months)

**Pattern Analysis**: Examine what worked, what didn't, and why. ICS discovered only 10% of volunteers engaged with Web3 tools initially—a crucial baseline for realistic expectations. AIFS identified the "inclusion paradox" where attempts at universal accessibility excluded those seeking specialized engagement.

**Systemic Insights**: Look beyond individual experiments to system-level patterns. All three organizations discovered that technical implementation proved easier than social adoption. Time horizons of 6-18 months emerged as realistic for meaningful change.

**Knowledge Transfer**: Transform individual learning into shareable knowledge. Case studies, pattern documentation, and implementation guides help others avoid repeated mistakes. The Reimagining Power Project's emphasis on knowledge mobilization multiplied impact beyond direct participants.

## Common Pitfalls and Mitigation

### Pitfall: Predetermined Outcomes

Organizations often enter "experimentation" with fixed ideas about solutions. AIFS believed they needed better NFT marketing. Equality Fund assumed blockchain would reduce costs. Real experimentation requires genuine openness to discovering you're solving the wrong problem.

**Mitigation**: Design experiments to test assumptions, not just implementations. Build in discovery phases. Celebrate learning that invalidates hypotheses as success, not failure.

### Pitfall: Scope Creep

Excitement about possibilities can lead to expanding experiments beyond manageable boundaries. Attempting everything ensures learning nothing.

**Mitigation**: Define rigid scope boundaries with clear rationale. ICS's limitation to 4 core users seemed modest but enabled genuine progress. Resist pressure to include everyone immediately.

### Pitfall: Innovation as Side Project

Equality Fund's key learning: "innovation requires dedicated resources, not add-on responsibilities." All participating staff balanced experimental work with full operational duties, leading to starts and stops that limited progress.

**Mitigation**: Secure dedicated time and resources for experimentation. Even 20% allocation produces better results than expecting overtime contributions. Consider intensive sprints over extended partial engagement.

### Pitfall: Insufficient Documentation

Organizations often treat documentation as bureaucratic burden rather than learning infrastructure. Insights evaporate without systematic capture.

**Mitigation**: Build documentation into experiment design. Assign specific responsibility. Use multiple methods—written notes, recordings, creative capture like AIFS's poetic harvesting. Documentation is the experiment's primary product.

## The Value of Patient Discovery

Experimentation requires patience uncommon in results-oriented organizational cultures. AIFS spent 8 months discovering their NFT model wouldn't work. ICS accepted 6-18 month adoption timelines. Equality Fund's planning phase revealed more than implementation would have.

This patience pays dividends by preventing larger failures. Organizations that rush to implement fashionable solutions without understanding their actual needs waste resources and damage stakeholder trust. Patient experimentation builds foundation for sustainable transformation.

The three RPP experiments demonstrate that controlled experimentation—with defined scope, systematic documentation, and learning-oriented success metrics—provides a viable path for organizations navigating fundamental questions about power distribution. By embracing uncertainty and structuring discovery, organizations can identify genuine opportunities for transformation while managing risk.

Most importantly, these experiments show that "failure" in implementation can represent success in learning. Equality Fund completed zero blockchain transactions but prevented investment in solving non-existent problems. AIFS abandoned their original model but discovered their true purpose. ICS engaged only 10% of volunteers initially but established foundation for sustainable growth.

In governance transformation, the journey of experimentation matters as much as any destination.
