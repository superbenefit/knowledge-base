# RPP Playbook Creation Execution Strategy

This execution strategy transforms the context-driven playbook workflow into actionable phases for creating the "DAO Cell and Community Governance" playbook. Each phase is designed for execution in a new Claude chat session, with explicit instructions for parallel processing, critical thinking, and comprehensive output generation.

**Critical Instructions**:

- Save all outputs to: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-playbooks\playbook-working-docs\`
- Use XML tags for structured outputs to enable clean handoffs between phases
- Execute independent operations in parallel whenever possible, BUT limit to 2-3 concurrent tool calls to avoid rate limits
- Generate comprehensive, detailed outputs - this is a complex task requiring thorough documentation
- If you encounter rate limit errors, wait a moment and retry with smaller batches

## Key Resources Summary

**Pattern Locations:**

- Official patterns: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\artifacts\patterns\`
- DAO Primitives patterns: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\dao-primitives\implementation\patterns\`
- Working documents: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-working-docs\`

**Guide Locations:**

- Current location: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\dao-primitives\implementation\guides\`
- Future location: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\artifacts\guides\` (not part of this work)

**Playbook Resources:**

- Context document: Attached to original request
- Existing playbook work: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-playbooks\`
    - Reference documents: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-playbooks\reference\`
    - Operational documents: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-playbooks\misc\`
- Stakeholder feedback: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-playbooks\reference\Reimagining Power Project - Stakeholder Reflection Responses.md`

**Output Location:** All work products should be saved to: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-playbooks\playbook-working-docs\`

**Key Stakeholder Feedback Themes to Incorporate:**

- Emphasize transparency and collaborative nature of governance
- Highlight cell-based working approach as non-hierarchical
- Address need for education, onboarding, and mindset shifts
- Show how stakeholder model enables autonomous project proposal
- Include "permission-less participation" concept
- Balance collective decision-making with efficiency concerns

## Success Metrics

The playbook succeeds when:

- Nonprofit leaders can understand and implement approaches independently
- Technical concepts are explained without jargon
- Real transformation examples inspire action
- Implementation guides address actual friction points
- Organizations feel equipped to begin their journey
- The SuperBenefit network grows through successful implementations

## Phase 1: Context-Aligned Content Inventory

**Phase 1 Initialization Prompt for New Chat:**

```
I need you to execute Phase 1 of the RPP Playbook Creation Strategy: Context-Aligned Content Inventory. This phase involves analyzing existing playbook resources, case studies, and patterns to create a comprehensive foundation for playbook development.

Context: We're creating a "DAO Cell and Community Governance" playbook for nonprofit executives with limited web3 experience who face bureaucracy, tech overwhelm, and time constraints.

You'll be:
1. Reviewing existing playbook documentation
2. Analyzing three RPP case studies for relevant content
3. Creating a comprehensive pattern inventory

IMPORTANT: Due to rate limits, retrieve files in batches of 2-3 at a time rather than all simultaneously. Pause briefly between batches if you encounter connection errors.

Please use batched processing for file retrievals, think critically about connections between materials, and create detailed outputs with XML structure for clean handoff to Phase 2.

Important: After each tool invocation, use interleaved thinking to reflect on the results and plan next steps. Be comprehensive in your analysis - we need thorough documentation for this complex project.

Begin with Task 1.1.
```

### Task 1.1: Review Existing Playbook Resources

**Execution Prompt:**

```
Execute a comprehensive review of existing playbook resources using batched parallel processing to respect rate limits.

BATCHED PARALLEL OPERATIONS - Execute in groups of 2-3 to avoid rate limits:

Batch 1 - Invoke these file retrievals:
- obsidian-mcp-tools:get_vault_file for: notes/rpp/rpp-playbooks/reference/Final Playbook Reflections & Context.md
- obsidian-mcp-tools:get_vault_file for: notes/rpp/rpp-playbooks/reference/Playbook Discovery Feedback.md

After Batch 1 completes, proceed with Batch 2:
- obsidian-mcp-tools:get_vault_file for: notes/rpp/rpp-playbooks/reference/Reimagining Power Project - Stakeholder Reflection Responses.md
- obsidian-mcp-tools:get_vault_file for: notes/rpp/rpp-playbooks/reference/Playbook Structural Guidelines & Templates.md

After receiving all results, engage in critical thinking:
- What patterns emerge across all documents?
- Which insights challenge our assumptions about the target audience?
- How do stakeholder experiences inform our approach?
- What structural elements are essential vs. optional?

Synthesize findings into structured output with these XML sections:

<playbook_review>
  <key_insights>
    <!-- Prioritized insights that will shape our approach -->
  </key_insights>
  
  <structural_guidelines>
    <!-- Essential structural elements identified -->
  </structural_guidelines>
  
  <stakeholder_themes>
    <!-- Recurring themes from stakeholder feedback -->
  </stakeholder_themes>
  
  <pattern_references>
    <!-- Any existing pattern documentation found -->
  </pattern_references>
  
  <gaps_identified>
    <!-- What's missing that we need to address -->
  </gaps_identified>
</playbook_review>

Be comprehensive - extract ALL relevant insights, not just highlights. This foundation shapes everything that follows.

Save detailed output as: playbook-working-docs/01-existing-resources-analysis.md
```

### Task 1.2: Extract Audience-Relevant Case Study Elements

**Execution Prompt:**

```
Analyze RPP case studies for audience-relevant content using batched retrieval and deep critical analysis.

CONTEXT FROM TASK 1.1: Reference the <key_insights> and <stakeholder_themes> from your previous analysis to inform this review.

BATCHED OPERATIONS - Retrieve case studies in groups to avoid rate limits:

Batch 1 - Retrieve first two case studies:
- obsidian-mcp-tools:get_vault_file for: notes/rpp/rpp-experiments/all-in-for-sport/aifs-case-study-draft.md
- obsidian-mcp-tools:get_vault_file for: notes/rpp/rpp-experiments/the-ics/ICS-Experiment-Case-Study.md

After Batch 1 completes, retrieve the third:
- obsidian-mcp-tools:get_vault_file for: notes/rpp/rpp-experiments/equality-fund/rpp-equality-fund-case-study-draft.md

Apply chain-of-thought analysis to each case study:
1. What specific problem did this organization face?
2. How does this align with our target audience's challenges?
3. What transformation occurred and over what timeline?
4. Which elements would resonate most with nonprofit executives?
5. What barriers were overcome and how?
6. What quick wins emerged?
7. What didn't work and why?

Create comprehensive extraction with XML structure:

<case_study_synthesis>
  <aifs_experiment>
    <problem_addressed><!-- Specific to audience context --></problem_addressed>
    <transformation_story><!-- Before/after with timeline --></transformation_story>
    <quick_wins><!-- Achievements within 30-60 days --></quick_wins>
    <barriers_overcome><!-- How they addressed constraints --></barriers_overcome>
    <governance_shifts><!-- Power dynamic changes --></governance_shifts>
    <key_quotes><!-- Compelling stakeholder voices --></key_quotes>
    <lessons_learned><!-- What to replicate/avoid --></lessons_learned>
  </aifs_experiment>
  
  <ics_experiment>
    <!-- Same structure -->
  </ics_experiment>
  
  <equality_fund_experiment>
    <!-- Same structure -->
  </equality_fund_experiment>
  
  <cross_case_patterns>
    <success_factors><!-- Common across cases --></success_factors>
    <recurring_challenges><!-- Patterns of difficulty --></recurring_challenges>
    <scalability_insights><!-- Size/context variations --></scalability_insights>
    <timeline_realities><!-- Actual vs. expected --></timeline_realities>
  </cross_case_patterns>
</case_study_synthesis>

Think deeply about connections between cases. Be exhaustive in extraction - we need all relevant examples for the playbook.

Save comprehensive output as: playbook-working-docs/02-case-study-synthesis.md
```

### Task 1.3: Pattern Inventory Through Context Lens

**Execution Prompt:**

```
Create comprehensive pattern inventory by analyzing multiple sources in parallel and synthesizing insights.

CONTEXT INTEGRATION: Use <pattern_references> from Task 1.1 and <cross_case_patterns> from Task 1.2 to guide your analysis.

BATCHED OPERATIONS - Work within rate limits:
1. First, list patterns from each directory sequentially:
   - artifacts/patterns/
   - notes/dao-primitives/implementation/patterns/
   - notes/rpp/rpp-working-docs/

2. After listing, batch retrieve patterns in groups of 2-3:
   - obsidian-mcp-tools:get_vault_file for each identified pattern file
   - Pause briefly between batches if needed to avoid rate limits

RATE LIMIT NOTE: If you encounter errors, reduce batch size to 2 files at a time and add brief pauses between batches.

Critical thinking for each pattern:
- Does this pattern appear in our successful case studies?
- What reading level is current documentation?
- Which audience pain points does it address?
- Where in the 0→0.5→1 journey does it fit?
- What jargon needs translation?
- Do we have social impact examples?

Create comprehensive inventory with XML structure:

<pattern_inventory>
  <pattern name="[Pattern Name]">
    <location><!-- File path --></location>
    <current_state>
      <documentation_quality><!-- Assessment --></documentation_quality>
      <reading_level><!-- Current grade level --></reading_level>
      <jargon_density><!-- High/Medium/Low --></jargon_density>
    </current_state>
    <case_study_usage>
      <appears_in><!-- Which experiments used it --></appears_in>
      <success_examples><!-- Specific outcomes --></success_examples>
    </case_study_usage>
    <audience_alignment>
      <pain_points_addressed><!-- From context doc --></pain_points_addressed>
      <implementation_phase><!-- 0→0.5, 0.5→1, or 1+ --></implementation_phase>
      <required_adaptations><!-- What needs changing --></required_adaptations>
    </audience_alignment>
  </pattern>
  <!-- Repeat for all core patterns -->
  
  <gap_analysis>
    <missing_patterns><!-- Needed but not documented --></missing_patterns>
    <patterns_without_examples><!-- Need case study links --></patterns_without_examples>
    <patterns_needing_context><!-- Require social impact framing --></patterns_needing_context>
  </gap_analysis>
</pattern_inventory>

Be meticulous - this inventory drives all pattern-related work in subsequent phases.

Save detailed output as: playbook-working-docs/03-pattern-inventory.md
```

## Phase 2: Pattern Development for Social Impact Context

**Phase 2 Initialization Prompt for New Chat:**

```
I need you to execute Phase 2 of the RPP Playbook Creation Strategy: Pattern Development for Social Impact Context. This phase transforms existing patterns into accessible guidance for nonprofit executives.

First, retrieve and review these Phase 1 outputs to understand the foundation:
- playbook-working-docs/01-existing-resources-analysis.md
- playbook-working-docs/02-case-study-synthesis.md
- playbook-working-docs/03-pattern-inventory.md

IMPORTANT: When retrieving files, work in batches of 2-3 to avoid rate limits. If you encounter connection errors, reduce batch size and retry.

After reviewing these files, confirm your understanding of:
1. Key stakeholder themes and insights
2. Case study examples available for each pattern
3. Current state of pattern documentation
4. Required adaptations for our audience

Use critical thinking throughout to ensure pattern descriptions truly serve our audience. Generate comprehensive outputs that will form the core content of our playbook.

Begin with Task 2.0: Phase Initialization and Validation.
```

### Task 2.0: Phase Initialization and Validation

**Execution Prompt:**

```
Before beginning pattern development, ensure you have proper context and understanding.

BATCHED RETRIEVAL - Get Phase 1 outputs in groups to avoid rate limits:

Batch 1 - Retrieve first two outputs:
- obsidian-mcp-tools:get_vault_file for: notes/rpp/rpp-playbooks/playbook-working-docs/01-existing-resources-analysis.md
- obsidian-mcp-tools:get_vault_file for: notes/rpp/rpp-playbooks/playbook-working-docs/02-case-study-synthesis.md

After Batch 1 completes, retrieve the third:
- obsidian-mcp-tools:get_vault_file for: notes/rpp/rpp-playbooks/playbook-working-docs/03-pattern-inventory.md

After retrieval, validate your understanding:

<phase_2_readiness>
  <context_understanding>
    <target_audience><!-- Confirm understanding of who we're writing for --></target_audience>
    <key_constraints><!-- Time, resources, bureaucracy, etc. --></key_constraints>
    <success_metrics><!-- What success looks like for users --></success_metrics>
  </context_understanding>
  
  <available_resources>
    <patterns_to_develop><!-- List from inventory --></patterns_to_develop>
    <case_examples><!-- Map patterns to available examples --></case_examples>
    <stakeholder_insights><!-- Relevant themes for pattern development --></stakeholder_insights>
  </available_resources>
  
  <development_approach>
    <reading_level_target><!-- Grade 13 as specified --></reading_level_target>
    <terminology_strategy><!-- How to handle jargon --></terminology_strategy>
    <example_integration><!-- How to weave in case studies --></example_integration>
  </development_approach>
  
  <readiness_confirmation>
    <!-- Confirm all necessary context is loaded and understood -->
  </readiness_confirmation>
</phase_2_readiness>

Only proceed to Task 2.1 after confirming complete understanding of context and requirements.
```

### Task 2.1: Create Grade 13 Language Pattern Descriptions

**Execution Prompt:**

```
Transform patterns into comprehensive, accessible descriptions for nonprofit executives.

CRITICAL THINKING: For each pattern, before writing, think through:
- What is the core value proposition for a nonprofit?
- Which case study best illustrates this pattern's impact?
- What fears or objections might arise?
- How does this fit into their transformation journey?

BATCHED PATTERN RETRIEVAL: After identifying patterns from your inventory review, retrieve pattern files in groups of 2-3 to avoid rate limits. If you have many patterns, process them in sequential batches with brief pauses between.

For each pattern, create rich, detailed descriptions:

<pattern_descriptions>
  <pattern name="[Pattern Name]">
    <elevator_pitch>
      <!-- 1-2 sentences explaining what it is in plain language -->
    </elevator_pitch>
    
    <mission_alignment>
      <!-- Why this matters for social impact organizations -->
      <!-- Connect to their values and goals -->
    </mission_alignment>
    
    <real_world_example>
      <!-- Detailed example from our case studies -->
      <!-- Include specifics: timeline, resources, outcomes -->
      <!-- Use stakeholder quotes where available -->
    </real_world_example>
    
    <minimum_viable_implementation>
      <!-- Smallest possible start -->
      <!-- Concrete first steps -->
      <!-- Resource requirements -->
      <!-- Timeline expectations -->
    </minimum_viable_implementation>
    
    <common_concerns>
      <concern><!-- Specific objection --></concern>
      <response><!-- Evidence-based response --></response>
      <!-- Repeat for all major concerns -->
    </common_concerns>
    
    <power_dynamics>
      <!-- How this pattern shifts traditional hierarchies -->
      <!-- Specific governance changes enabled -->
    </power_dynamics>
    
    <success_metrics>
      <!-- How to measure progress -->
      <!-- Early indicators of success -->
      <!-- Long-term impact measures -->
    </success_metrics>
  </pattern>
  <!-- Repeat for all core patterns -->
</pattern_descriptions>

VALIDATION: After drafting each pattern:
1. Check reading level (target: Grade 13)
2. Verify case study example is accurate and compelling
3. Ensure jargon is eliminated or explained
4. Confirm it addresses documented pain points
5. Test that power dynamics are clearly articulated

Be comprehensive and detailed - these descriptions are the heart of the playbook. Don't summarize; expand and enrich.

Save complete output as: playbook-working-docs/04-pattern-descriptions.md
```

### Task 2.2: Develop Pattern Interaction Narratives

**Execution Prompt:**

```
Create detailed narratives showing how patterns work together for organizational transformation.

CRITICAL ANALYSIS: Before writing narratives:
- Review case studies for actual pattern combinations used
- Identify which combinations address multiple pain points
- Consider the journey from simple to complex implementations
- Think about dependencies and sequencing

Develop comprehensive interaction scenarios:

<pattern_interactions>
  <scenario name="Increasing Community Participation in Capital Distribution">
    <patterns_involved>
      <pattern>Cells</pattern>
      <pattern>Token-based governance</pattern>
      <pattern>Group state</pattern>
    </patterns_involved>
    
    <problem_context>
      <!-- Detailed description of the nonprofit challenge -->
      <!-- Why traditional approaches fail -->
      <!-- Stakeholder perspectives -->
    </problem_context>
    
    <implementation_journey>
      <phase_1>
        <!-- How Cells create initial structure -->
        <!-- Timeline: weeks 1-4 -->
        <!-- Resources needed -->
        <!-- Early wins -->
      </phase_1>
      <phase_2>
        <!-- Adding token governance -->
        <!-- Timeline: weeks 5-12 -->
        <!-- Integration challenges -->
        <!-- Stakeholder onboarding -->
      </phase_2>
      <phase_3>
        <!-- Group state for transparency -->
        <!-- Timeline: weeks 13-16 -->
        <!-- Full system operation -->
        <!-- Measured outcomes -->
      </phase_3>
    </implementation_journey>
    
    <case_validation>
      <!-- Which experiment used this combination -->
      <!-- Actual timeline vs. planned -->
      <!-- Real outcomes achieved -->
      <!-- Quotes from participants -->
    </case_validation>
    
    <visual_representation>
      <!-- Description of how to visualize this interaction -->
      <!-- Key connection points -->
      <!-- Flow of value/decisions -->
    </visual_representation>
    
    <adaptation_guide>
      <!-- How to modify for different contexts -->
      <!-- Scaling considerations -->
      <!-- Alternative patterns if some aren't feasible -->
    </adaptation_guide>
  </scenario>
  
  <!-- Create 3-4 comprehensive scenarios total -->
</pattern_interactions>

Think systemically about how patterns reinforce each other. Be detailed about timelines and resources based on real experiments.

Save comprehensive output as: playbook-working-docs/05-pattern-interactions.md
```

## Phase 3: Implementation Guide Extraction

**Phase 3 Initialization Prompt for New Chat:**

```
I need you to execute Phase 3 of the RPP Playbook Creation Strategy: Implementation Guide Extraction. This phase transforms experiment insights into practical guides addressing specific friction points.

First, retrieve and review these previous outputs:
- Phase 1 outputs: 01-existing-resources-analysis.md, 02-case-study-synthesis.md, 03-pattern-inventory.md
- Phase 2 outputs: 04-pattern-descriptions.md, 05-pattern-interactions.md
- Any existing guides from: notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/

After review, confirm your understanding of:
1. Key friction points where organizations get stuck
2. Available experiment insights for each friction point
3. Pattern descriptions that guides should reference
4. Success metrics from real implementations

Generate comprehensive, practical guides that directly address documented barriers to adoption.

Begin with Task 3.0: Phase Initialization and Validation.
```

### Task 3.0: Phase Initialization and Validation

**Execution Prompt:**

```
Ensure complete context before creating implementation guides.

PARALLEL RETRIEVAL - Get all necessary context:

  </available_solutions>
  
  <guide_development_plan>
    <priority_guides><!-- List with rationale --></priority_guides>
    <case_study_mapping><!-- Which experiments inform which guides --></case_study_mapping>
    <success_criteria><!-- How we'll know guides are effective --></success_criteria>
  </guide_development_plan>
</phase_3_readiness>

Confirm readiness before proceeding to guide creation.
```

### Task 3.1: Create Constraint-Specific Implementation Guides

**Execution Prompt:**

```
Develop comprehensive guides addressing documented friction points with real experiment insights.

BATCHED ANALYSIS: For each priority friction point, work through these analyses in sequence to avoid overloading:
- Extract relevant insights from case studies
- Identify applicable patterns from Phase 2 work
- Review existing guides for gaps
- Consider stakeholder feedback about barriers

Create detailed, actionable guides:

<implementation_guides>
  <guide name="Wallet Safety & On-ramping for Organizations">
    <problem_statement>
      <!-- Why this is a major barrier -->
      <!-- Specific fears and concerns -->
      <!-- Cost of not addressing -->
    </problem_statement>
    
    <minimum_viable_approach>
      <!-- Smallest safe first step -->
      <!-- Based on Equality Fund's approach -->
      <!-- Exact resources needed -->
    </minimum_viable_approach>
    
    <step_by_step_process>

    <visual_aids>
      <!-- Screenshots needed -->
      <!-- Diagrams to create -->
      <!-- Workflow visualizations -->
    </visual_aids>
    
    <security_checklist>
      <!-- Item-by-item security measures -->
      <!-- Based on real experiment protocols -->
    </security_checklist>
    
    <case_study_validation>
      <!-- How Equality Fund handled this -->
      <!-- Actual timeline and costs -->
      <!-- Lessons learned -->
    </case_study_validation>
    
    <risk_mitigation>
      <!-- Specific risks and mitigations -->
      <!-- Insurance/backup considerations -->
      <!-- Recovery procedures -->
    </risk_mitigation>
    
    <success_metrics>

      <!-- Which patterns this enables -->
      <!-- Next steps after mastering -->
    </pattern_connections>
  </guide>
  
  <!-- Repeat for other priority guides -->
</implementation_guides>

Be extraordinarily detailed - these guides must be truly actionable, not high-level overviews. Include all lessons from experiments.

### Task 3.2: Extract Quick Win Opportunities

**Execution Prompt:**

```
Mine all insights for quick wins that build momentum and confidence.

COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS: Think critically about:
- What can genuinely be achieved in 30-60 days?
- Which wins are most visible to stakeholders?
- How do quick wins build toward larger transformations?
- What resources are realistically required?

PARALLEL EXTRACTION: Simultaneously analyze all case studies for quick win examples.

Create detailed quick win catalog:

<quick_wins_catalog>
  <quick_win name="[Descriptive Name]">
    <win_description>
      <!-- What it achieves -->
      <!-- Why it matters -->
      <!-- Who benefits -->

      <user_benefit><!-- Direct impact on constituents --></user_benefit>
      <team_morale><!-- Effect on internal culture --></team_morale>
    </stakeholder_impact>
    
    <success_measurement>
      <!-- Specific metrics -->
      <!-- How to capture/report -->
      <!-- Baseline comparisons -->
    </success_measurement>
    
    <building_blocks>
      <!-- What this enables next -->
      <!-- Patterns introduced -->
      <!-- Momentum created -->

      <!-- How they build on each other -->
      <!-- Cumulative impact timeline -->
    </recommended_order>
  </strategic_sequencing>
</quick_wins_catalog>

Think strategically about quick wins as confidence builders, not just isolated achievements.

## Phase 4: Playbook Assembly with Audience Focus

**Phase 4 Initialization Prompt for New Chat:**

```
I need you to execute Phase 4 of the RPP Playbook Creation Strategy: Playbook Assembly with Audience Focus. This phase combines all previous work into a cohesive, navigable playbook.

First, retrieve and review ALL previous outputs (01-07) to understand the full scope of content available. 

IMPORTANT: Work in batches of 2-3 files to avoid rate limits. With 7 files to retrieve, plan for 3 batches with brief pauses between if needed.

After review, confirm your understanding of:
1. All pattern descriptions and interactions
2. Implementation guides and quick wins
3. Stakeholder insights and structural guidelines
4. Case study examples and evidence

Your goal is to create a strategically organized playbook with multiple navigation paths for different user needs.

Begin with Task 4.0: Phase Initialization and Content Audit.
```

### Task 4.0: Phase Initialization and Content Audit

**Execution Prompt:**

```
Conduct comprehensive content audit before assembly.

BATCHED RETRIEVAL - Get previous outputs in groups to avoid rate limits:

Batch 1 (Files 01-03):
- playbook-working-docs/01-existing-resources-analysis.md
- playbook-working-docs/02-case-study-synthesis.md

```

### Task 4.1: Structure Content for Progressive Disclosure

**Execution Prompt:**

```
Assemble playbook with strategic information architecture supporting multiple engagement depths.

CRITICAL THINKING: Consider:
- How do busy executives scan vs. read deeply?
- What builds confidence to proceed further?
- How can structure itself communicate value?
- Where do people need off-ramps and on-ramps?

Create comprehensive playbook structure:

<playbook_structure>

### Task 5.1: Develop Visual Communication Tools

**Execution Prompt:**

```
Create comprehensive visual tools that clarify concepts and support stakeholder buy-in.

DESIGN THINKING: For each visual:
- What's the core insight to communicate?
- Who needs to understand this?
- What would make them say "now I get it"?
- How can we show transformation visually?

Develop detailed visual tool specifications:

<visual_tools>
  <pattern_summaries>
    <pattern name="[Each Core Pattern]">
      <visual_concept>
        <!-- Metaphor or diagram approach -->
