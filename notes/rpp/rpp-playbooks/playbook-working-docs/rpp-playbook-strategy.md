# RPP Playbook Creation Execution Strategy

This execution strategy transforms the context-driven playbook workflow into actionable phases for creating the "DAO Cell and Community Governance" playbook. Each phase contains specific tasks with execution prompts designed to maintain alignment with the target audience's needs and constraints.

**Important**: Save all outputs to: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-playbooks\playbook-working-docs\`

## Phase 1: Context-Aligned Content Inventory

The foundation of an effective playbook lies in understanding what materials resonate with the target audience. This phase filters all available content through the lens of nonprofit leaders with limited web3 experience who face bureaucracy, tech overwhelm, and time constraints.

### Task 1.1: Review Existing Playbook Resources

Examine all existing playbook documentation to understand prior work and avoid duplication.

**Execution Prompt:**

```
Review existing playbook resources to understand context and prior work.

Step 1 - Initial Analysis:
Before reviewing documents, consider:
- What patterns might we expect to see in stakeholder feedback?
- What structural elements are essential for our target audience?
- How might discovery findings shape our approach?

Step 2 - Document Review:
Playbook folder contents:
- F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-playbooks\reference\Final Playbook Reflections & Context.md
- F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-playbooks\reference\Playbook Discovery Feedback.md
- F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-playbooks\reference\Reimagining Power Project - Stakeholder Reflection Responses.md
- F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-playbooks\reference\Playbook Structural Guidelines & Templates.md

Step 3 - Synthesis and Extraction:
Extract and synthesize:
1. Key insights from discovery and feedback documents
2. Structural guidelines already established
3. Stakeholder feedback themes relevant to content development
4. Any existing pattern documentation or references

Step 4 - Pattern Recognition:
Analyze across all documents:
- What themes appear repeatedly?
- Which insights challenge our assumptions?
- What gaps or opportunities emerge?

Save output as: playbook-working-docs/01-existing-resources-analysis.md
```

### Task 1.2: Extract Audience-Relevant Case Study Elements

Review the three RPP case studies to identify elements that specifically address the problems and constraints documented in the context brief.

**Execution Prompt:**

```
Using insights from Task 1.1, review RPP case studies for audience-relevant content.

Step 1 - Pre-Analysis Reflection:
Before reading case studies, based on Task 1.1 findings and context document:
- What transformation stories would most resonate with our audience?
- Which barriers/constraints should we prioritize?
- What evidence would be most compelling for nonprofit executives?

Step 2 - Deep Case Study Analysis:
Case Studies:
- F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-experiments\all-in-for-sport\aifs-case-study-draft.md
- F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-experiments\the-ics\ICS-Experiment-Case-Study.md  
- F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-experiments\equality-fund\rpp-equality-fund-case-study-draft.md

For each case study, analyze:
1. What worked and why?
2. What didn't work and what can we learn?
3. How does this align with our audience's context?

Step 3 - Targeted Extraction:
Focus on extracting:
1. Transformation stories showing clear before/after states for social impact organizations
2. Examples addressing bureaucracy, decision paralysis, and fear of the unknown
3. Quick wins achieved within limited time/resource constraints
4. Governance shifts that don't recreate old hierarchies
5. Evidence of increased transparency, participation, and equitable capital distribution

Step 4 - Cross-Case Synthesis:
Identify patterns across all three cases:
- Common success factors
- Recurring challenges
- Scalability insights
- Adaptation strategies

Create summary organizing findings by:
- Problem addressed (from context document list)
- Solution approach used
- Timeline and resources required
- Measurable outcomes achieved
- Quotes demonstrating social impact perspective

Save output as: playbook-working-docs/02-case-study-synthesis.md
```

### Task 1.3: Pattern Inventory Through Context Lens

Map available patterns to the specific needs and journey stages of social impact organizations transitioning to decentralized governance.

**Execution Prompt:**

```
Building on Tasks 1.1 and 1.2, create comprehensive pattern inventory aligned with audience needs.

Step 1 - Integration Analysis:
Using outputs from previous tasks:
- Which patterns appear in successful case study examples?
- How do existing playbook resources reference patterns?
- What pattern gaps did stakeholder feedback reveal?

Step 2 - Pattern Discovery:
Inventory patterns from all locations:
- F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\artifacts\patterns\
- F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\dao-primitives\implementation\patterns\
- F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-working-docs\

For each pattern in our core set (Coordi-nations, Peer to peer payments, Cells, Local nodes, Token-based governance, Group state):
1. Verify pattern exists and retrieve current documentation
2. Assess readiness for Grade 13 reading level explanation
3. Identify gaps where social impact examples are needed
4. Note technical jargon requiring translation
5. Map to implementation phases (0 → 0.5 → 1 progression)

Step 3 - Gap Analysis:
Cross-reference with case study synthesis:
- Which case study successes lack documented patterns?
- Which existing patterns lack real-world examples?
- What patterns need social impact contextualization?

Step 4 - Inventory Compilation:
Create inventory showing:
- Pattern name and location
- Current state assessment
- Required adaptations for audience
- Implementation phase alignment
- Case study examples available
- Priority for playbook inclusion

Validation: Ensure every pattern maps to at least one audience pain point from context document.

Save output as: playbook-working-docs/03-pattern-inventory.md
```

## Phase 2: Pattern Development for Social Impact Context

2. Rewrite using Grade 13 reading level language
3. Replace crypto/web3 jargon with mission-aligned terminology
4. Add social impact context examples from case studies
5. Emphasize how pattern addresses power dynamics in traditional organizations

Format each pattern description as:
- What it is (1-2 sentences, plain language)
- Why it matters for your mission (social impact framing)
- Real example from similar organization
- How to start small (minimum viable approach)
- Common concerns addressed

Step 3 - Validation Loop:
For each pattern description:
1. Test against Grade 13 reading level requirement
2. Verify it addresses at least one documented pain point from context
3. Ensure it includes concrete example from our case studies
4. Confirm jargon has been eliminated or explained
If any criteria aren't met, revise before proceeding.

Step 4 - Cross-Pattern Coherence:
Review all descriptions together:
- Do they use consistent terminology?
- Is the progression from basic to advanced clear?
- Do examples build on each other effectively?
