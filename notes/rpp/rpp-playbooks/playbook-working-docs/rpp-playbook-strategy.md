# RPP Playbook Creation Execution Strategy

This execution strategy transforms the context-driven playbook workflow into actionable phases for creating the "DAO Cell and Community Governance" playbook. Each phase is designed for execution in a new Claude chat session, with explicit instructions for comprehensive resource review, critical analysis, and high-quality output generation.

**Critical Instructions**:

- Save all outputs to: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\rpp\rpp-playbooks\playbook-working-docs\`
- Execute independent operations in parallel whenever possible, BUT limit to 2-3 concurrent tool calls to avoid rate limits
- Generate practical, actionable outputs focused on implementation
- If you encounter rate limit errors, wait a moment and retry with smaller batches
- Use the playbook template at `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\tools\templates\playbook.md` as your structural guide
- UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you use update_active_file methods because you have a track record of using it without knowing which file is active which results in destructively editing the wrong file
- DO NOT include projections or recommendations for how long something will take
- DO NOT hallucinate or invent "facts" which are not based in solid reference information
- Writing must be Grade 14 level (college-educated professionals) with logical progression and evidence-based content

- Highlight cell-based working approach as non-hierarchical
- Address need for education, onboarding, and mindset shifts
- Show how stakeholder model enables autonomous project proposal
- Include "permission-less participation" concept
- Balance collective decision-making with efficiency concerns

## Success Metrics

The playbook succeeds when:

- Nonprofit leaders can understand and implement approaches independently
- Technical concepts are explained without jargon
- Real transformation examples inspire action
- Implementation guides address actual friction points
- Organizations feel equipped to begin their journey
- The SuperBenefit network grows through successful implementations

```

### Task 1.2: Case Study Analysis

**Execution Prompt:**

```
Extract implementation data from all three case studies.

For each case study, document:
- Initial organizational state (specific metrics where available)
- Patterns implemented (exact names from pattern library)
- Timeline of implementation
- Measurable outcomes achieved
- Challenges encountered and how addressed
- Direct quotes from participants

Focus on replicable elements and concrete results. Exclude speculative benefits.
