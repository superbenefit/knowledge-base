# Case Study Essentials

## All In For Sport (AIFS)

### Initial Challenge
All In For Sport struggled with an unclear value proposition—traditional philanthropists viewed Web3 as unnecessary complexity while crypto funders saw their shift away from NFTs as abandoning innovation. Complete dependence on volunteer effort created unpredictable capacity and unfulfilled commitments to community partners.

### Patterns/Approaches Used
- **Gatherings Pattern**: Structured spaces for cross-sector relationship building (111 participants across 6 sessions)
- **Coordi-nations Model**: Network of aligned communities rather than single hierarchical entity
- **Cell Structure**: Autonomous operational teams within shared values framework
- **Minimum Viable Permissionless Approach**: Start simple, expand gradually

### Concrete Outcomes (Timeline: August 2024 - March 2025)
- Clarified identity as coordination infrastructure (not direct service provider)
- AIFSIP-04 governance proposal ratified separating stewardship from operations
- Partnership with Women Win for Web3 exploration established
- Selected for IOC Tech365 coordination role (25 orgs, 16 countries)
- Maintained engagement despite organizational uncertainty

### Key Implementation Lesson
Organizations must be willing to abandon failing models when evidence shows limited community value—AIFS's pivot from NFT sales to coordination infrastructure exemplified necessary flexibility for transformation.

### Direct Quote Capturing Transformation
"I came thinking I had solutions. I learned I barely understood the problems." - Web3 participant reflecting on the bridging experience between technical and community perspectives.

## Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS)

### Initial Challenge
ICS faced governance bottlenecks with centralized decision-making limiting growth, volunteers lacking meaningful participation in strategic decisions, and traditional grant-based funding creating uncertainty for long-term planning.

### Patterns/Approaches Used
- **Governance Infrastructure**: Multisig wallet (2-of-4), ENS domain, Hats Protocol roles
- **Local Web3 Chapter**: Green Pill Network node connecting local to global movement
- **On-chain Impact Documentation**: Karma GAP for ecosystem-compatible tracking
- **Opportunistic Web3 Adoption**: Flexibility to respond to emergent opportunities

### Concrete Outcomes (Timeline: January - July 2025)
- 4 core team members actively using governance systems (exceeded goal of 3)
- Launched London's first Green Pill Network chapter (4 meetings held)
- Top 10% ranking in Gitcoin Grants Round 23
- Pivoted from custom hypercerts to ecosystem-standard tools
- Redesigned education from single workshop to cohort model

### Key Implementation Lesson
Communities seek participation in decision-making more than new funding mechanisms—this insight fundamentally reoriented the approach from resource acquisition to enabling agency.

### Direct Quote Capturing Transformation
"You get as much as you give" - Core insight about stakeholder engagement, where influence comes from active contribution rather than formal advisory roles.

## Cross-Case Patterns

### Common Success Factors
- **Small committed teams** (4-5 people) can establish comprehensive infrastructure
- **External validation** (partnerships, grants) accelerates internal confidence
- **Flexibility over rigid planning** yields better outcomes
- **6-18 month realistic timeline** for meaningful adoption

### Replicable First Steps
1. Build technical readiness with core team (multisig, basic governance tools)
2. Create regular gathering spaces (monthly minimum)
3. Focus on enjoyable experiences over technical training
4. Document and share progress for external validation
5. Be ready to pivot based on community feedback

### Implementation Warnings
- Only ~10% of volunteers will initially engage with Web3 tools
- Conceptual gap between Web3 and mainstream understanding is wider than expected
- Coordination work lacks sustainable funding models in current ecosystem
- Technical infrastructure is easy; social adoption is hard

### Transformation Indicators
- Shift from "what resources can we get?" to "how can people participate?"
- Movement from hierarchical decisions to distributed governance
- Evolution from predetermined outcomes to emergent opportunities
- Transition from internal focus to ecosystem connections
