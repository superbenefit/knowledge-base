Project Updates and Strategy

The team provided updates on several key areas of the project, including experiments and playbooks.

They have evolved from creating one or two playbooks to building a knowledge base of structured information that can be used to compose multiple playbooks.

This approach allows for the potential creation of AI agents that can compose customized playbooks for specific needs.

The team is working on one playbook covering their RPP experiments, along with the underlying structured knowledge base.

They are also developing a concept called the 'Agent Swarm's Infinite Front Porch,' which aims to use AI agent swarms to surface different knowledge bases and turn them into a knowledge commons.

This involves partnering with organizations like All in for Sport and Open Civics to build agents for their knowledge bases and swarm them together, allowing anyone to access collective knowledge on structuring projects and using tools.

The team has applied for an Octant grant to support this work, with results expected in about two weeks.

The team has been working on an Impact Yield Fund concept, which involves a DeFi mechanism allowing philanthropic funders to generate yield for impact activities.

This concept includes a blended finance funding allocation mechanism to utilize the yield.

They are also setting up plans for phase two of the RPP, focusing on three main priorities: community-governed innovation networks, social finance innovation (including the yield fund concept), and community coordination and knowledge sharing.

For the final two months of the project, they are completing playbooks and knowledge base work, continuing experiments with ICS, Equality Fund, Women Win, and All in for Sport, and wrapping up the gatherings program.

Equality Fund and Women Win Experiment

Sue and Nicole presented an experiment proposal for testing Web3 tools in fund transfers between Equality Fund, Women Win, and their grantee partners.

The experiment aims to test two hypotheses: 1) Web3 tools can reduce financial costs for moving money, and 2) they can increase flexibility and safety considerations in difficult operating environments.

The team plans to map a historical flow of funds and mirror it in a Web3 sandbox exercise.

They discussed whether to conduct a sandbox experiment or a real small transaction, considering factors such as approval processes, contractual obligations, and the value of real versus simulated data.

The team agreed that a sandbox approach might be most appropriate for the initial test, allowing for quick and inexpensive insights.

They plan to map out various aspects to test, including technical feasibility, capacity and competency needs, and potential barriers in different financial jurisdictions.

The experiment is designed to gather data to demonstrate feasibility, generate interest from grantee partners, and potentially support fundraising efforts for further testing and infrastructure development.

All in for Sport Update

Shanny reported that the All in for Sport gatherings have been completed.

The pilot program consisted of five gatherings that generated valuable conversations.

The next steps include updating Jumpstar and Trillium with session recordings and attendance statistics.

The team plans to continue these gatherings with the IC tech 365 group within their Discord community, focusing on ongoing onboarding and learning.

ICS and ETH Denver Updates

Heenal provided updates on the ICS experiment and their experiences at ETH Denver.

The ICS experiment is progressing, though it was briefly paused due to ETH Denver attendance.

At the conference, Heenal connected with numerous individuals and participated in various events, including a marketing hackathon where they won a prize.

He noted significant interest in localism, with many discussions around topics similar to the team's interests.

Heenal observed that while the main ETH Denver event was underwhelming, side events and networking opportunities were valuable.

He mentioned the emergence of a movement focusing on regenerative practices in the crypto space, sparked by discussions around the lack of impact-oriented programming at ETH Denver.

Heenal also highlighted growing interest in knowledge commons, AI agents, and the Infinite Front Porch concept, expressing a desire to develop a proof of concept for the latter.
