Intros & Updates

Workstreams and Budget Allocation: The core team is organized into workstreams, and a co-budgeting process was introduced. Budgets were distributed evenly among core team members, who then allocated these funds to various workstreams. This decentralized approach aims to facilitate smoother operations and accountability across different project areas.



Stakeholder Engagement and Barriers: There was a discussion about the barriers stakeholders face, particularly in terms of participation and onboarding. The dialogue included identifying technical and informational challenges that newcomers might encounter, aiming to make the onboarding process more inclusive and accessible.



Sue Snider from the Equality Fund discussed their innovative approaches to grant-making, emphasizing non-competitive and community-centric models: presentation here

Non-Competitive Grant-Making
Sue highlighted a shift from competitive to non-competitive grant-making processes. Initially, the Equality Fund's traditional grant-making involved competitive methods where a vast number of applications were narrowed down significantly, resulting in a low success rate for applicants. This process was perceived as potentially discouraging for many organizations due to its low yield of funding relative to the number of applicants.



In response, the Equality Fund reimagined their approach by developing a grant-making stream that emphasizes:

Radical love: Shifting away from competition towards mutual support within the community.
Solidarity and transparency: Encouraging collaboration among participants rather than fostering competition.
Non-competitive processes: Designing mechanisms where funds are distributed based on community consensus rather than competitive selection.


This approach was applied specifically within a network of Women's Funds, which are familiar with each other and share common goals, thus fostering a supportive rather than competitive environment.



Community and Innovation
Sue also discussed the broader impact of these changes on the community and the innovations they spurred within the organization:

Strengthening ecosystems: The new funding model aimed not only to distribute funds but also to strengthen the overall ecosystem of Women's Funds by promoting collective empowerment and shared decision-making.
Participatory grant-making: The Equality Fund focused on making their grant-making process participatory, where the recipients have significant input into how funds are distributed, reflecting a true shift in power dynamics.
Long-term commitments: The fund seeks to provide long-term funding commitments (preferably 8-10 years) to ensure sustainable impact, rather than short-term project-based funding.


Scaling and Future Challenges Looking forward, the Equality Fund is considering how to scale these innovative grant-making practices globally. They are exploring the integration of technology, such as DAOs and other Web 3.0 technologies, to manage and distribute funds more effectively across a global network.



Sue's presentation highlighted a significant paradigm shift in how funding organizations can operate to create more equitable and supportive funding environments, focusing on community strength, long-term impact, and inclusive participation in decision-making processes.
