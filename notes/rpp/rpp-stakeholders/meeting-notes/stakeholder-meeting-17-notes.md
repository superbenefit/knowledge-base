Progress has been made in developing a lexicon, a dictionary of jargon, to make deliverables more compact and concise.

The lexicon is robust enough for regular LLMs like Claude to understand and contextualize new knowledge.

Plans include gathering reports from various stakeholders, processing them into the knowledge base, and creating permanent archives.
