Reimagining Power Project Updates

Playbooks are progressing with an 'ephemeral cell' structure set up to fund a treasury and allocate tasks for authoring, serving as a prototype for simple but powerful crypto-based organizational structures.

Experiments like the ICS (International Cooperative Society) and Equality Fund/Women Win collaboration are showing good progress.

A concept for an 'AI agent swarm' called the Infinite Front Porch is being developed, aiming to use AI agents to access community datasets and knowledge repositories while maintaining data sovereignty through crypto rails.

An impact yield fund concept is being explored, which would use crypto mechanisms to lock funds in contracts and generate yield for funding impactful activities, potentially bringing philanthropic funding into Web3 in safe ways to support new funding and governance mechanisms.

The team is working on a strategy note for the next phase of Reimagining Power (RPP phase two), considering emerging opportunities and future project direction.

Experiments with AI agents are being conducted in the Super Benefit community, with promising results when using well-organized documentation.

Exploration is ongoing on how to make Reimagining Power's knowledge more accessible to AI agents.

Collaboration with Coordinate, a DAO tooling provider, is being considered to implement agent setups for social media spaces in the All in for Sport governance experiment.



Gatherings Series Updates

The fourth gathering is scheduled for the coming Wednesday, focusing on AI, sport, and social impact.

Despite initial challenges in finding speakers, a strong panel has been assembled.

The fifth and final gathering will focus on capital allocation, with speakers already lined up.

Discussions are ongoing about potentially continuing the gatherings within the Tech 360/5 program, which could involve expanding the network and creating spaces for sharing and collaboration among program cohorts.



International Olympic Committee (IOC) Program Update

The program runs from March 2025 to April 2026.

Its goal is to understand emerging technologies, including AI, AR, VR, and blockchain, particularly in relation to scoring and grading in sports.



Green Pill London Chapter Update

A successful panel event was held recently, featuring Heenal, Michelle, and other notable speakers.

Efforts are underway to build interest and community in London, with plans for an in-person gathering in March.

The process of becoming an official Green Pill local chapter is ongoing, which will provide better access to resources and people.

A scoping document for the ICS experiment has been created, outlining the roles of Reimagining Power and ICS in this phase of the project.

Plans are in place for attending ETH Denver, marking their first major Web3 conference experience.



Equality Fund and Women Win Collaboration Update

Focus is on mapping the flow of money between Equality Fund and Women Win, as Women Win acts as a fiscal sponsor for some Equality Fund projects.

Identification of pain points, transaction costs, and potential benefits of using blockchain in this process is planned.

Next steps involve creating a detailed map of the financial flow, including transaction costs and time frames, before exploring how blockchain could improve the process.

Once a proof of concept is developed, engagement with potential grantees to test the concept further is planned.



All in for Sport AI Agent Development

Community involvement is sought in developing an AI agent for All in for Sport, seeking input on its design, name, and functionality.

This experiment aims to explore how AI can be integrated into community-driven projects, presenting a unique approach compared to typical organizational AI implementations.

Two projects have been nominated through Gibbth to test their Quadratic funding mechanism for grassroots projects: one for an indigenous community seeking sports equipment, and another for Mike Swift's initiative.

Challenges were encountered in the nomination process, particularly with using multi-sig wallets, highlighting the importance of streamlined onboarding processes for Web3 projects.



Next Meeting and Communication

The next meeting is scheduled for March 3rd at 4 PM Eastern Time.

Team members are encouraged to share any questions or clarifications in the Discord stakeholder channel between meetings.

Emphasis was placed on the importance of community involvement in developing Web3 funding mechanisms and onboarding processes for local sports projects.
