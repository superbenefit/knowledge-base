Welcome all   
To our 5th group call  
We'll check in and begin  
Agenda, er... check?  
That's the thing with cutting edge tech   
It doesn't always work like a charm  
But it's ok, there's no harm  
For today, we're clear on our roles  
Making progress on purpose and high level goals  
United on this majestic quest
 
There's different types of rest  
It's not just physical  
We can be more intentional  
Find work that's more creative  
Like in this collaborative   
And we are all so appreciative  
Of the joy in our lives  
As our families thrive  
We sing and dance in cold showers  
As together we're reimagining power

We're getting some flesh on the bones  
We're bringing the experiments home  
Where the rubber meets the road  
We are each a node   
In an infinite network  
structure for emergence  
Value and values  
Tools to relate & co-create  
Each primitive has a state  
Descriptive but not prescriptive  
Where purpose & values sit

This stakeholder group's purpose and high level goals  
Are a source of direction, but not control  
We'll inform the strategy for the core team  
And then take our place behind the scenes  
Allowing operations to proceed  
But stepping in if we need
 
No need to wordsmith the purpose  
Our goals are well defined  
dreaming into being a world  
where no person is left behind  
Grassroots community led  
Where every mouth is fed
 
Our direction we are naming  
The next steps we are framing  
We're setting the wheels in motion  
With our web3 version of Notion   
And stickies and stories aplenty  
This is our entry  
Into a rabbit hole  
Of the soul  
Let's all enroll  
And make the world whole

Let's rise above the memes, vibes & chatter  
Place matters  
People matter  
This work matters
 
We're looking for areas we can test  
I can't wait to explore the rest.
