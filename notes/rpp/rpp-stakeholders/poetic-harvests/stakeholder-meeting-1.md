Welcome! To the Reimagining Power Stakeholder Meeting  
It's hard to get together with priorities competing

But here we all are   
Together, in one room  
Not on Discord but zoom  
It's ok, we'll get there soon

Finding our way here together  
Is part of the fun

You see me, I see you, we're good  
So what is it, that we could  
Do together in this exploration?  
How might our collaboration   
Unfold  
Let us be bold  
And go forth without fear  
All experiments are welcome here

We've been talking about these ideas for a long time  
Now let's put them into practice 

Let's create an environment  
For experiments  
For collective wisdom and learning  
We all have questions burning  
Deep in our hearts  
Now we can start  
Shifting power  
Looking at alternative structures  
Reimagining power, systems, cultures

Our ways of working are fluid  
Meetings crashed by kids  
We are in the midst  
Of an experiment, already!  
We're exactly where we need to be

We are here  
Curious, committed, excited  
Honoured to be invited  
Into this social R&D, incubator, innovation lab  
Where together we'll show that web3 is not a fad  
But a doorway to collective liberation  
Though new means of coordination  
A local to systemic translation

How can we scale relationships?  
How can we scale participatory grant-making?  
How can we scale scale local intelligence?  
From simple structures to start  
Evolving into complexity is an art  
We are seeds, we are sprouts  
Together we're trying new things out  
With those most impacted at the centre   
Together, we will enter  
A space of play and co-creation  
Experimentation, collaboration  
  
Our current structures can no longer be successfully operated  
We need new organizational structures that are more sophisticated   
Let's build them together!  
We're itching to go  
What projects shall we first explore?  
Now we have this connection, we want more  
A world awaits, let's open the door  
Ready to get working and see what's in store

Guided by our mission, new paths we're navigating  
We've gotten started, together we'll go far  
We're ready to start working and collaborating,   
and seeing where the synergies are
