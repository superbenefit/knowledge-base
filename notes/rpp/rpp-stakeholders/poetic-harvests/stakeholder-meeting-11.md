Welcome to stakeholder meeting number 11
Almost a year into this mission

Before discussing progress and tasks
We arrive and land with laughs
Reimagining the ways of the past
When in doubt we always ask
Something special here is brewing
We are human beings not human doings
We are each other's comfort foods
We are maple syrup on everything

All In For Sport received some funds
So now 5 Gatherings can be run
We're planning the topics and who to invite
And welcome this group's feedback and insight

ICS is sense-making + mapping the problem space
Exploring possibilities for a DAO based on place

Playbooks are making good progress
With collaboration an integral part of the process
Partnering with OpenCivics
In a way that's so fluid

Looking ahead to the next 5 years, what can we expect?
What's becoming possible through emerging tech?
Everyone's obsessed with LLMs
And we shall share with them
That you need open protocols, you need interoperability and security
And all that can be provided through web3
Without blockchain
AI is a losing game

What might be a good experiment today, what might be some directions for the future?
Let's fail fast, cheap and early - and fail on the right things!

A wealth of opportunity awaits
A world in crisis, a world to reshape
There are some thing we'll have to break
Reimagining power is ambitious, make no mistake
Together, who knows what change we could make
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take
