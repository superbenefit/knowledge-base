If you could have an unlimited supply of one thing, what would it be?
We want hugs, time, positive regard and peace
We seek good conversation
We move forward in collaboration

Lots has happened, lots has changed
Lots has emerged or been rearranged
We consider our next steps
We're gathering across boundaries
A community of practice planning playbooks
An ephemeral cell to propel

Dreaming of an agent swarm
Of self-sovereign forms
We harness their power to transform
A future reborn where new ideas form
Where Privacy is preserved
And All beings cared for and served

Developing a concept of a crypto yield fund
Locking capital so impact won't be undone
Where capital becomes a flywheel
Driving universal abundance

We're putting AI to the test
Superbenny is trying his best
His answers aren't great just yet 
Organizing info will help him, I bet!

Gatherings are going great
Just two more dates
It's almost time to celebrate
We relate with new mates

The ICS project is scoped
We're full of hope
We're starting a local web3 meet
We get ready and move our feet
Getting governance codified and on-chain
So much to learn, so much to gain

Cross-border financial transfers are fraught with delays
Bureaucracy, uncertainty, paperwork and pain
All evaporate through the magic of blockchain

Forging trust, equity, hope we can sustain
Together we weave a more human terrain
Equity and justice through the power of blockchain
