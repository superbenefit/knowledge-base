Ok stakeholder meeting 6, we're ready, steady
To welcome Doug, you know most of us already
This group to you is not a mystery
With pillar you have a long history
Now you're tagging into this team
From behind your computer screen
From your background in sport
To joining Discord
Thank you for being here
As this project clicks into gear
We're
solidifying our purpose and high level goals

Together, we will
explore how web3 can shift power, transform systems and shape better futures.

by mobilizing philanthropic practices that are transparent, participatory, community first and that test new collaborative governance models

recognizing our role beyond funding and financial capital

unlocking collective intelligence

enabling infrastructure and tooling

co-learning and peer support

storytelling, knowledge sharing and narrative shifting

These goals resonate
What a a way to shake
Up the way our organization usually works
Together, we are reimagining power

How will we get there?
What is our strategy?
There are four workstreams
Cross cutting themes
Developed by the core team
And a series of experiments
That haven't been designed yet

We have to bring a vision of what's possible
To show people in a really real way what's different

There's scepticism about web3
People feel that crypto means greed and anarchy
It's not for you and me
Not hatred but ignorance, fear,
No time to hear
all about it

My colleagues don't understand
And don't have time to understand
How can we show them?

What's an experiment, a test, a demonstration
That shows has web3 innovation
Can revolutionize the situation
In our organization
It's an opportunity for exploration
Reimagining how we do impact and storytelling
Through impact attestations
What is the next slice of experimentation
That we can bite off to showcase what's possible?

How together, can we showcase what's possible?
