Now we're done with our festive cheer
Welcome to a new year
As 2024 clicks into gear
Welcome to all we're co-creating here

Today we each could be anywhere
We choose to be here because we care
About co-creating a world more just and fair
Last time we discussed agreements we share
Like what are the expectations
For communication and participation?
And now we're back, ready to go
Jumping into our collective workflow
We have big ideas, we try to make them verbal
Looking for overlaps between our respective circles
High level questions we want to explore
Lower level experiments that make us want more

These questions are iterative, they will evolve
Nobody know who or what they'll involve
How may we hold the tension?
How may we proceed with intention
To serve our work and also the bigger picture
To embrace this complex mixture
Of grassroots work, getting our hands dirty
While also driving a decades long journey?

Let's get started wherever we can
Give the proposals and Discord channels a scan
And let's begin
Let's get in
Let's jump in

This is our time, this is the hour
Are you ready to reimagine power?
