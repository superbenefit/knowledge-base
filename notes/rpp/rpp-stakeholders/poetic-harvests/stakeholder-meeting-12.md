Stakeholder meeting number 12  
We're arriving with all the feels  
Traveling with wings and wheels  
Planes trains and automobiles  
What will be revealed?  
We're waiting to board  
Waiting to see what's in store  
The Equality Fund Discovery Report  
So many directions to explore

Managing data, Using AI innovation  
On-chain tracking of reputation  
Governance and how we make decisions  
Tokenized systems to allow broader contributions  
Even autonomous assessment teams  
Could be real though they feel like dreams  
We're interested to explore decentralized data  
This stuff is brand new - not even in beta

There are silos to disrupt  
Patterns to interrupt  
Existing systems corrupt  
Ready to erupt

It's hard to explain terms to people outside the space  
We're developing a lexicon as part of our knowledge base  
That will define terms, make language easy to understand  
And together we'll move forward, hand in hand

Crypto-based funds disbursement could be an easier entry point  
A way to get started, without colleagues' noses getting out of joint  
A financial experiment would feel somehow safe  
A manageable first step, without a leap of faith

And this would be so valuable for the network  
We learn through this work  
None of us is an expert  
We are all learning

We're nimble and determined  
Nurturing delight  
Building the ship in flight  
Surfacing needs, challenges, pain points, values  
Co-creating spaces for collaboration  
A culmination of months of preparation  
Receptive to our community's needs

The gatherings begin next week!  
This is where we sow the seeds  
We water the fields  
And await our harvest's yields

The fruits of community
