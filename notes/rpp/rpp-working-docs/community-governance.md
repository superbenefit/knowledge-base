**Community governance** enables broad networks of stakeholders to collectively steward shared [resources](tags/resources.md) and guide organizational evolution through transparent, participatory [[decision-making]] processes at the [constituency scale](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-scale/constituency.md).

related to:
- [Multi-Stakeholder Governance](multistakeholder-governance.md)
- [Operational Governance](notes/rpp/rpp-working-docs/operational-governance.md)

This pattern provides a [framework](tags/frameworks.md) for implementing inclusive, transparent, and [sustainable](tags/sustainability.md) governance systems that safeguard organizational [purpose](tags/purpose.md) while enabling [community-driven](tags/community.md) evolution.

## Problem / Solution Context

The Problem/Solution Context section should explore:

1. Legacy Challenges in Community Governance
   * Concentration of power in traditional governance structures
   * Exclusion of community voices from decision-making
   * Misalignment between community needs and organizational direction
   * Barriers to meaningful participation and engagement
   * Challenges in maintaining long-term community alignment

2. Existing Community Governance Approaches
   * Traditional membership organizations
   * Cooperative and collective governance models
   * Digital community governance systems
   * Recent innovations in participatory decision-making
   * Strengths and limitations of current approaches
   * Gaps that remain unaddressed

3. Web3 Opportunities
   * How blockchain enables transparent community governance
   * Token-based voting and delegation systems
   * Mechanisms for sustainable community engagement
   * Infrastructure requirements for constituency-scale participation
   * Integration with existing community systems

This section should emphasize how community governance represents an evolution in collective decision-making, particularly in enabling sustained community participation while preserving organizational purpose.

## How Community Governance Works: Pattern Sets by Scale

Community governance manifests differently based on geographical scope and coordination needs. Here we explore proven patterns organized by their primary operational context.

### Local Community Patterns
These patterns focus on governance within geographically concentrated communities, typically at the neighborhood, city, or regional level.

#### Local Nodes
- **Description**: Semi-autonomous local groups that coordinate through shared protocols while maintaining independence
- **Use Cases**: Community organizations, local cooperatives, neighborhood associations
- **Key Features**:
  - Decentralized decision-making at the local level
  - Shared resources and knowledge across nodes
  - Local autonomy with network benefits
  - Bottom-up governance structures

#### Local Hubs
- **Description**: Central coordination points that facilitate collaboration between multiple local initiatives
- **Use Cases**: Community centers, maker spaces, innovation hubs
- **Key Features**:
  - Physical spaces for community gathering
  - Resource sharing and collective management
  - Cross-pollination between initiatives
  - Hybrid governance models combining direct and representative democracy

#### Complementary Economics
- **Description**: Local economic systems that complement traditional markets
- **Use Cases**: Local currencies, time banks, mutual credit systems
- **Key Features**:
  - Community-driven value creation
  - Alternative exchange mechanisms 
  - Local economic resilience
  - Participatory economic governance

### Cosmolocal Coordination Patterns
These patterns bridge local and global scales, enabling coordination across regions while maintaining local context.

#### Bioregional Finance
- **Description**: Financial systems aligned with ecological boundaries and regional needs
- **Use Cases**: Watershed conservation funds, regional development initiatives
- **Key Features**:
  - Place-based investment strategies
  - Environmental stewardship integration
  - Multi-stakeholder governance
  - Regional economic circuits

#### Public Goods Funding Mechanisms for IRL communities
- **Description**: Mechanisms for collectively funding shared resources and infrastructure
- **Use Cases**: Commons maintenance, public infrastructure, shared services
- **Key Features**:
  - Quadratic funding mechanisms
  - Participatory budgeting
  - Collective benefit allocation
  - Transparent resource management

#### Municipal MycoFi for Community Resilience
- **Description**: Networked financial systems connecting municipal initiatives
- **Use Cases**: Inter-city cooperation, regional development projects
- **Key Features**:
  - Municipal bond networks
  - Cross-jurisdiction coordination
  - Shared investment pools
  - Democratic oversight mechanisms

### Global Network Patterns
These patterns enable coordination across geographical boundaries, supporting truly decentralized organizations.

#### Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs)
- **Description**: Networks combining physical infrastructure with digital coordination
- **Use Cases**: Distributed energy grids, sensor networks, telecom infrastructure
- **Key Features**:
  - Physical-digital integration
  - Distributed ownership models
  - Network governance mechanisms
  - Incentive alignment systems

#### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
- **Description**: Financial systems operating through distributed networks
- **Use Cases**: Lending protocols, asset management, regenerative finance (ReFi)
- **Key Features**:
  - Automated market mechanisms
  - Smart contract governance
  - Token-based coordination
  - Transparent financial operations

#### Digital Democracy & Decentralized Governance
- **Description**: Tools and systems for democratic participation at scale
- **Use Cases**: Global DAOs, digital nations, online communities
- **Key Features**:
  - Digital voting systems
  - Delegation mechanisms
  - Discussion forums
  - Proposal systems

##### Coordi-nations
- **Description**: Large-scale coordination frameworks for distributed communities
- **Use Cases**: Global organizations, virtual states, network societies
- **Key Features**:
  - Identity systems
  - Reputation mechanisms
  - Cross-cultural governance
  - Scalable decision-making

#### Knowledge Commons
- **Description**: Shared information resources with community governance
- **Use Cases**: Open source projects, research networks, educational platforms
- **Key Features**:
  - Collaborative content creation
  - Peer review systems
  - Open access principles
  - Community moderation

### Implementation Considerations

When implementing these patterns, consider:

1. **Scale Appropriateness**: Choose patterns that match your community's size and geographical distribution

2. **Technical Requirements**: Assess the technical infrastructure needed to support chosen patterns

3. **Cultural Fit**: Ensure patterns align with community values and practices

4. **Resource Availability**: Match pattern complexity with available resources and capabilities

5. **Governance Maturity**: Start with simpler patterns and evolve as governance capacity grows

Each pattern can be adapted and combined to create governance systems that meet specific community needs while maintaining core principles of participation, transparency, and effectiveness.

## Community Governance in Practice

### Implementation Strategies

Document the practical steps for organizations adopting community governance. Writers should:

1. Describe the preparation phase, including community assessment, participation design, and initial engagement strategies.

2. Outline the implementation process, from community formation through full governance activation.

3. Provide guidance on maintaining engagement, evaluating effectiveness, and evolving the system.

### Required Primitives

For each primitive required by this pattern, writers should explain:
1. The primitive's role in enabling community governance
2. How it interacts with other governance components
3. Key considerations for implementation
4. Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

Focus on practical guidance drawn from real implementations, using concrete examples to illustrate successful approaches.

## Resources and References

Writers should compile relevant resources that help readers implement and understand community governance. Include:

1. Essential reading on community governance frameworks and implementation
2. Technical documentation for key tools and platforms
3. Notable research and case studies
4. Active communities and support channels

Keep the resource list focused and practical, prioritizing materials that provide direct implementation value.
