Operational [governance](tags/governance.md) enables autonomous teams to coordinate effectively around [shared resources](tags/resources.md) and [objectives](tags/goals.md) using [decentralized](tags/decentralization.md) infrastructure and sociocratic principles at the coordination scale.

related to:
- [Community Governance](notes/rpp/rpp-working-docs/community-governance.md)
- Multi-Stakeholder Governance
- [Operational Governance](notes/rpp/rpp-working-docs/operational-governance.md)

This pattern provides a [framework](tags/frameworks.md) for implementing efficient, transparent, and adaptable operational systems that maintain [autonomy](tags/autonomy.md) while ensuring [coordination-scale](artifacts/dao-primitives-framework/group-scale/coordination-scale.md).

## Problem / Solution Context

The Problem/Solution Context section should explore:

1. Legacy Challenges in Operations
   * Bottlenecks in traditional hierarchical decision-making
   * Coordination failures in flat organizational structures
   * Resource allocation inefficiencies
   * Impact on team autonomy and organizational effectiveness

2. Existing Operational Approaches
   * Traditional management hierarchies
   * Holacratic and sociocratic models
   * Agile and squad-based frameworks
   * Recent innovations in decentralized operations
   * Strengths and limitations of current approaches

3. Web3 Opportunities
   * How smart contracts enable autonomous team operations
   * Technical capabilities for resource allocation and tracking
   * Integration with existing operational systems
   * Infrastructure requirements for decentralized operations

This section should emphasize how operational governance represents an evolution in organizational coordination, particularly in enabling effective day-to-day operations while preserving decentralized principles.

## How Operational Governance Works

Operational governance is implemented through a systematic process that begins with cell formation and coordination mechanisms, moves through resource allocation systems, and culminates in the deployment of technical infrastructure that enables autonomous yet coordinated operations. This approach ensures both team autonomy and organizational alignment while maintaining focus on effective execution.

### Mechanism

The implementation of operational governance follows three key phases:

1. Cell Structure and Formation
   * Defining autonomous team boundaries and interfaces
   * Establishing resource requirements and allocation systems
   * Creating decision-making protocols
   * Building shared understanding of operational parameters

2. Coordination Framework Design
   * Developing inter-cell communication channels
   * Creating resource sharing mechanisms
   * Establishing conflict resolution procedures
   * Designing progress tracking and reporting systems
   * Documenting operational protocols

3. Technical Infrastructure Development
   * Implementing smart contracts for resource allocation
   * Building team coordination tools
   * Creating operational dashboards and metrics
   * Establishing automation and integration points

### Operationalizing the Governance System

This section should describe how the operational system functions in practice. Writers should:

1. Explain how resources, information, and decisions flow through the operational system, focusing on both autonomous and coordinated activities.

2. Map operational flows showing how teams interact, resources are allocated, and decisions are made. Include process diagrams where helpful.

3. Detail technical implementations, including smart contract architecture, operational tools, and monitoring systems.

4. Provide practical examples demonstrating how teams operate autonomously while maintaining coordination.

Focus on creating clear, actionable documentation that helps readers understand both technical and practical aspects of implementation.

## Operational Governance in Practice

### Implementation Strategies

Document the practical steps for organizations adopting operational governance. Writers should:

1. Describe the preparation phase, including team analysis, resource assessment, and initial design decisions.

2. Outline the implementation process, from cell formation through full operational deployment.

3. Provide guidance on monitoring, evaluation, and iteration of the operational system.

### Required Primitives

For each primitive required by this pattern, writers should explain:
1. The primitive's role in enabling operational governance
2. How it interacts with other operational components
3. Key considerations for implementation
4. Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

Focus on practical guidance drawn from real implementations, using concrete examples to illustrate successful approaches.

## Resources and References

Writers should compile relevant resources that help readers implement and understand operational governance. Include:

1. Essential reading on operational frameworks and implementation
2. Technical documentation for key tools and platforms
3. Notable research and case studies
4. Active communities and support channels

Keep the resource list focused and practical, prioritizing materials that provide direct implementation value.
