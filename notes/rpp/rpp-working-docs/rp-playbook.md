This outline provides a framework for developing a comprehensive playbook on leveraging decentralized technologies to transform traditional power dynamics in philanthropy and social impact work.

## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (1-2 pages)

<!-- Purpose: Guide for transforming traditional power dynamics in philanthropy using decentralized technologies. Target audience: Philanthropic organizations, social impact initiatives, community organizers. Scope: Practical implementation of decentralized approaches for more equitable resource allocation and decision-making. Expected outcomes: More participatory, transparent and effective social impact systems. -->

## II. CONTEXT & ORIENTATION (3-5 pages)

<!-- Cover the problem of power centralization in philanthropy, target audiences, key use cases, prerequisites, terminology, and core principles like structural redistribution, community agency, transparency by design, coordinated autonomy, and technological appropriateness. -->

### A. Problem Statement: Power Centralization in Philanthropy

### B. Target Audiences

### C. Use Cases

### D. Prerequisites

### E. Key Terminology

### F. Core Principles

## III. PATTERN CATEGORIES (7-10 pages)
