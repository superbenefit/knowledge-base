# Intervention Development Framework

## Purpose

This framework provides structured guidance for developing web3 interventions with partner organizations. It supports the systematic progression from discovery through implementation planning, emphasizing practical system improvements and stakeholder engagement.

## Objectives

**1. Collaborative Discovery**

Produce a **discovery report** that covers:

1. Mapping the state of the current system
2. Identifying systemic issues in the current system
3. Exploring areas of interest for potential intervention

**2. Intervention Mapping**

1. Identify intervention areas where systemic issues could be addressed
2. Map practical implementation pathways with clear resource requirements
3. Develop comprehensive intervention mapping document that guides implementation planning

# Framework Steps

## Part 1 - Collaborative Discovery

**Framing**

This framework loosely follows the [Estuarine Mapping process](https://cynefin.io/wiki/Estuarine_framework) for systems change. There is an emphasis on beginning by mapping a granular understanding of the current state of the system, agreed upon by everyone participating in the mapping. From here the map of the current system can yield different aspects of the system that hold the potential for change and the level of cost/difficulty in changing them. From this point of clarity and agreement it is then relatively straight-forward to agree on next steps.

> This approach assumes that systems (and solutions) will be in the realm of complexity, where intervention and observation is needed to see how a system responds to change (emergent properties), rather than traditional approaches that assume that the results of an intervention can be predicted based solely on inputs to the system as in non-complex systems. Because we are working with concepts like network intelligence we have to assume that these systems are complex and act accordingly.

### 1. Map the state of the current system

Gather stakeholders who want to participate in the intervention design into a workshop setting to work through the mapping process. This can be done in a single workshop with all stakeholders present. Ideal group size is 6 or less.

> If the stakeholders don't represent a diverse enough set of perspectives from across the system being mapped, consider bringing other voices into the session, or conducting research conversations in advance so that these missing perspectives can be represented in the conversation. It may be that time/logistical/access constraints do not allow for a broad enough group of stakeholders to be present while keeping the overall group size small enough to be effective. Also, some of the voices that are needed for the discovery to be effective will not be the same voices that want to participate in the actual mapping process as stakeholders. We need to manage these factors and design the process to not miss vital perspectives from across the system.

Map the organizational systems that you want to explore:

- Describe the particular systems that you are exploring using system mapping approaches
- Understand how capital/resources move through layers in the system
- Trace how information moves between layers to inform decision-making functions
- The particular system you are mapping may not have the same structure as examples - aim to accurately map what the current system looks like

We recommend using a shared whiteboarding tool like Figjam to do this mapping. Create a simple grid to capture each layer in the different systems.

- Do separate maps for different systems that you want to map, even if they are within the same organization. This will allow them to stay clean and uncluttered
- Focus on understanding the different functions that each layer in the system contributes
- When you have a clear map (or maps) that everyone can agree on, move to identifying systemic issues

### 2. Identify systemic issues in the current system

> The deeper the exploration into the issues in the system, the richer the opportunity space for intervention will become. If much of the sense-making around issues in the system has already been done, then this process can be relatively straightforward. However if this is being approached fresh, then it is likely that this step would benefit from a deeper sense-making process facilitation. See the sense-making facilitation tools for possible approaches.

- Identify patterns in the current system that cause the system to produce poor outcomes. Specifically, where do systems of power impede the system's ability to be collectively intelligent?
- Map the facets of the system that cause these issues to arise
- Look to understand how these facets interact through the different layers. Why does the system work this way?
  - Why did it evolve to produce a particular dynamic?
  - What risks are being mitigated by the current composition of the system?
  - What forces are at work to keep the system in this state?

> It is likely that the system has negative power dynamics as a result of a lack of network intelligence - the systems of power have emerged as a consequence of attempts to safeguard against risks caused by insufficient information. The overall design goal is to redesign information flows and systems of power together to arrive at systems that are both more intelligent and more balanced in terms of power, with these two facets being mutually reinforcing.

### 3. Discovery Report

Produce a report that documents this discovery process, mapping of the current system and systemic issues that can be shared with stakeholders. Use the discovery report template in the `/templates/` directory.

## Part 2 - Intervention Mapping

### 1. Identify intervention areas where systemic issues could be addressed

**a. Arising from the system mapping, explore how the system might be reimagined:**

- Where can agency, voice, power etc be distributed differently in the system?
- How can this make the system more collectively intelligent?
- How can it make the system better able to make decisions that include information, input, participation and ownership from those closer to the reality of the impact that the system is trying to have?

> Often the communities who are best placed to produce the intelligence that the system needs will not have the capacity to engage with it (even if mechanisms for them to engage have been presented). This is an important design constraint and why genuine engagement with affected communities needs to be at the heart of solutions design.

**b. Identify the highest potential opportunities:**

- Where is there good alignment and crossover between stakeholders (i.e desire + resources) to make something happen?
- Where are the cost/time gradients such that changing the system could have a good chance of succeeding?
- Where can Web3 patterns (tools and practices) offer high leverage opportunities? Look for ways to leverage open digital protocols and more decentralized approaches to make systems more intelligent, more equitable and more impactful
- Which Web3 patterns can be implemented as solutions? Reference SuperBenefit's pattern library and other web3 pattern resources

**c. Decide which opportunity to pursue:**

- If sections a & b are done well there will likely be an obvious intervention candidate
- If there is disagreement about which intervention to choose, it likely indicates a lack of clarity or granularity in sections a & b. Go back and reassess these sections until there is shared understanding

> You may need to move through sections a & b several times as insights from section b inform your thinking about the possible intervention areas and approaches.

### 2. Develop intervention mapping

Develop a comprehensive intervention mapping document that will form the basis for implementation planning. Use the intervention mapping template in the `/templates/` directory.

Key components include:
- System intervention points with clear connections to discovery findings
- Implementation pathways with detailed steps, resource requirements, and timelines
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Success metrics and evaluation approaches
- Stakeholder engagement plan

### 3. Plan next steps

Based on the intervention mapping:
- Identify immediate next steps for implementation
- Determine resource requirements and funding needs
- Establish timeline and milestones
- Plan stakeholder communication and engagement
- Define decision points and approval processes

## Integration with Case Study Development

This framework supports the broader three-stage case study development process:

1. **Discovery** → Discovery Report (this framework Part 1)
2. **Intervention Mapping** → Intervention Mapping Document (this framework Part 2)  
3. **Implementation** → Implementation Retrospective (documented separately)
4. **Synthesis** → Case Study (combines all three stages)

## Supporting Resources

- **Templates**: Discovery Report and Intervention Mapping templates in `/templates/` directory
- **Workflows**: Discovery Process Workflow provides detailed facilitation guidance
- **Tools**: Sense-making facilitation tools offer various approaches for deepening system understanding
- **Examples**: Completed case studies demonstrate how this framework translates to real implementations

## Adaptation Guidelines

This framework can be adapted based on:

**Organizational Context**: Different types of organizations may require different mapping approaches or stakeholder engagement strategies

**Time Constraints**: The depth of system mapping and issues identification can be adjusted based on available time and resources

**Stakeholder Availability**: When key stakeholders can't participate directly, consider alternatives for capturing their perspectives

**Existing Knowledge**: If substantial system understanding already exists, the discovery phase can be streamlined to focus on validation and gap-filling

The framework is complete when you have comprehensive discovery documentation and clear intervention mapping that provides a foundation for practical implementation planning.
