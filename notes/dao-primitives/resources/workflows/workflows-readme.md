**Key Components**:
- Preparation phase with stakeholder identification and setup guidance
- System mapping workshop facilitation with detailed steps
- Systemic issues identification with pattern recognition approaches
- Areas of interest exploration connecting to web3 patterns
- Synthesis and report creation process

**Output**: Discovery Report that provides foundation for intervention mapping

**Duration**: Typically 1-3 workshop sessions plus synthesis time

### Intervention Development Framework (`intervention-development-framework.md`)
**Purpose**: Structured approach for moving from discovery insights to practical intervention planning

**Key Components**:
- Framework for identifying intervention areas where systemic issues can be addressed
- Process for mapping highest potential opportunities with stakeholder alignment
- Guidance for developing comprehensive intervention mapping documents
- Integration with broader case study development process

**Output**: Intervention Mapping document with clear implementation pathways

**Builds On**: Discovery Process Workflow outputs and stakeholder engagement

### Implementation Retrospective Workflow (`implementation-retrospective-workflow.md`)
**Purpose**: Systematic approach for conducting comprehensive retrospectives on implementation outcomes and lessons learned

**Key Components**:
- Planning and preparation for retrospective data gathering
- Systematic stakeholder engagement across all implementation participants
- Comprehensive impact assessment including power redistribution analysis
- Synthesis methodology for extracting transferable lessons
- Integration of stakeholder requirements (funder reporting, community value)

**Output**: Implementation Retrospective document addressing accountability and learning needs

**Builds On**: Implementation experience guided by Intervention Mapping

### Case Study Synthesis Workflow *(Planned for Phase 2)*
**Purpose**: Process for combining Discovery Report + Intervention Mapping + Implementation Retrospective into final case studies

**Key Components** *(To be developed)*:
- Three-stage synthesis methodology
- Claude Desktop + MCP integration for document processing
- SuperBenefit knowledge base integration approaches
- Visual documentation and quality review processes

### Workflow Integration

**Discovery to Intervention Development**:
- System maps inform intervention opportunity identification
- Stakeholder interests guide pathway selection  
- Systemic issues become focus areas for intervention design
- Web3 pattern connections suggest implementation approaches

**Intervention Development to Implementation**:
- Intervention mapping provides clear implementation roadmap
- Resource requirements and timelines guide practical execution
- Risk assessments prepare for challenges and mitigation
- Success metrics provide framework for outcome tracking

**Implementation to Retrospective**:
- Implementation experience provides foundation for comprehensive retrospective
- Original intervention mapping provides baseline for outcome assessment
- Stakeholder engagement during implementation informs retrospective participation
- Success metrics from mapping guide impact evaluation approach

**All Workflows to Case Study Synthesis**:
- Discovery provides background context and system understanding
- Intervention Development explains approach and methodology selection
- Implementation Retrospective supplies journey documentation and outcomes
- Synthesis combines all elements into comprehensive case study

## Usage Guidelines

### Workflow Adaptation
While workflows provide systematic approaches, they should be adapted based on:

**Organizational Context**: Different organization types may require modified facilitation approaches or stakeholder engagement strategies

**Time and Resource Constraints**: Workflows can be compressed or extended based on available facilitation time and stakeholder availability

**Implementation Complexity**: Larger or more complex implementations may require extended retrospective processes with additional stakeholder engagement

**Stakeholder Requirements**: Different funders or partners may emphasize different aspects of documentation and accountability

### Facilitation Requirements

**Discovery Process Workflow**:
- Requires facilitator comfortable with systems mapping and stakeholder engagement
- Benefits from familiarity with web3 patterns and decentralized governance concepts
- Ideal facilitator has experience with sense-making processes and group dynamics

**Intervention Development Framework**:
- Requires strategic thinking and practical implementation planning skills
- Benefits from understanding of web3 technologies and implementation approaches
- Ideal facilitator can bridge between conceptual frameworks and practical execution

**Implementation Retrospective Workflow**:
- Requires skills in stakeholder interviewing and impact assessment
- Benefits from experience with evaluation methodologies and outcome measurement
- Ideal facilitator can synthesize diverse perspectives into coherent narratives

### Quality Standards

All workflow outputs should meet standards for:

**Stakeholder Engagement**: Authentic participation from diverse perspectives across the system being mapped and implemented

**System Understanding**: Accurate and agreed-upon mapping of current state with clear identification of intervention opportunities

**Practical Viability**: Implementation planning that considers realistic resource requirements, timelines, and stakeholder capacity

**Impact Documentation**: Comprehensive assessment of outcomes including both intended and unintended effects

**Knowledge Integration**: Outputs that connect meaningfully to SuperBenefit's patterns, playbooks, and broader knowledge ecosystem

## Integration with Templates

Each workflow is supported by corresponding templates in the `/templates/` directory:

- **Discovery Process Workflow** → uses **Discovery Report Template**
- **Intervention Development Framework** → uses **Intervention Mapping Template**  
- **Implementation Retrospective Workflow** → uses **Implementation Retrospective Template**
- **Case Study Synthesis Workflow** → uses all three templates plus synthesis methods

Workflows provide the facilitation process while templates provide the documentation structure. Used together, they ensure both effective process execution and comprehensive documentation.

## Supporting Resources

### Tools Directory
The `/tools/` directory contains facilitation resources that support workflow execution:
- Sense-making facilitation tools for deepening system understanding
- Process selection guidance for different organizational contexts
- Integration resources for SuperBenefit knowledge ecosystem

### Examples and References
- Completed case studies (like RPP Governance Design) demonstrate workflow outcomes
- SuperBenefit pattern library provides web3 approach references
- Existing system mapping examples offer guidance for discovery facilitation

## Getting Started

1. **Review template outputs**: Understand what each workflow produces by examining the corresponding templates
2. **Assess organizational readiness**: Determine stakeholder availability and engagement capacity for all three phases
3. **Select appropriate depth**: Choose workflow intensity based on time, resources, and organizational context
4. **Prepare facilitation resources**: Gather tools, examples, and supporting materials before beginning
5. **Plan complete sequence**: Ensure adequate time between stages for synthesis and stakeholder review across all three phases

## Stakeholder Requirements Integration

All workflows are designed to address key stakeholder requirements:

**Funder Accountability**:
- Most significant change documentation throughout all phases
