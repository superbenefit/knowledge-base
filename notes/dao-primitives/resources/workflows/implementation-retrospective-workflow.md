# Implementation Retrospective Workflow

## Purpose

This workflow provides systematic guidance for conducting comprehensive retrospectives on web3 intervention implementations. It supports the systematic capture of implementation journey, outcomes, challenges, and lessons learned to create valuable documentation for stakeholders and knowledge sharing.

## Objectives

The implementation retrospective process aims to produce a **comprehensive retrospective document** that covers:

1. Complete implementation journey documentation with phases, activities, and outcomes
2. Thorough impact assessment including quantitative and qualitative results
3. Honest analysis of challenges encountered and solutions developed
4. Strategic lessons learned for future implementations
5. Stakeholder requirements fulfillment (funder reporting, community value documentation)

## Process Overview

The retrospective process follows a systematic data gathering and synthesis approach:

**Phase 1: Planning & Preparation** → **Phase 2: Data Gathering** → **Phase 3: Stakeholder Engagement** → **Phase 4: Impact Assessment** → **Phase 5: Synthesis & Documentation**
