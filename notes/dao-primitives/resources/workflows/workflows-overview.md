# Case Study Development Workflows

This directory contains step-by-step workflows for executing the complete three-stage case study development process. These workflows provide detailed facilitation guidance, stakeholder engagement strategies, and synthesis methodologies to support high-quality case study creation.

## Complete Three-Stage Workflow System

The workflow system now provides comprehensive coverage of the entire case study development cycle:

```
Discovery Process Workflow
    ↓ (produces Discovery Report)
Intervention Development Framework  
    ↓ (produces Intervention Mapping)
[Implementation Phase - guided by mapping]
    ↓ (implementation occurs)
Implementation Retrospective Workflow
    ↓ (produces Implementation Retrospective)
Case Study Synthesis Workflow (Phase 2)
    ↓ (produces final Case Study)
```

## Available Workflows

### Discovery Process Workflow (`discovery-process-workflow.md`)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive facilitation guide for conducting collaborative discovery with partner organizations

**Output**: Discovery Report that provides foundation for intervention mapping

### Intervention Development Framework (`intervention-development-framework.md`)
**Purpose**: Structured approach for moving from discovery insights to practical intervention planning

**Output**: Intervention Mapping document with clear implementation pathways

### Implementation Retrospective Workflow (`implementation-retrospective-workflow.md`)
**Purpose**: Systematic approach for conducting comprehensive retrospectives on implementation outcomes and lessons learned

**Output**: Implementation Retrospective document addressing accountability and learning needs

### Case Study Synthesis Workflow *(Planned for Phase 2)*
**Purpose**: Process for combining all three stages into final case studies

**Output**: Comprehensive case studies for SuperBenefit knowledge base

## Integration with Templates

Each workflow is supported by corresponding templates in the `/templates/` directory:

- **Discovery Process Workflow** → **Discovery Report Template**
- **Intervention Development Framework** → **Intervention Mapping Template**  
- **Implementation Retrospective Workflow** → **Implementation Retrospective Template**
- **Case Study Synthesis Workflow** → uses all three templates plus synthesis methods

## Key Improvement: Complete System

Phase 1 has successfully created a complete three-stage workflow system that addresses the full case study development lifecycle from initial discovery through final documentation. The addition of the Implementation Retrospective Workflow ensures systematic capture of implementation outcomes and lessons learned, addressing both stakeholder accountability requirements and knowledge sharing needs.
