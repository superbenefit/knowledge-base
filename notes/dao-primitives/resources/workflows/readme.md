# Case Study Development Workflows

This directory contains step-by-step workflows for executing the three-stage case study development process. These workflows provide detailed facilitation guidance, stakeholder engagement strategies, and synthesis methodologies to support high-quality case study creation.

## Available Workflows

### Discovery Process Workflow (`discovery-process-workflow.md`)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive facilitation guide for conducting collaborative discovery with partner organizations

**Key Components**:
- Preparation phase with stakeholder identification and setup guidance
- System mapping workshop facilitation with detailed steps
- Systemic issues identification with pattern recognition approaches
- Areas of interest exploration connecting to web3 patterns
- Synthesis and report creation process

**Output**: Discovery Report that provides foundation for intervention mapping

**Duration**: Typically 1-3 workshop sessions plus synthesis time

### Intervention Development Framework (`intervention-development-framework.md`)
**Purpose**: Structured approach for moving from discovery insights to practical intervention planning

**Key Components**:
- Framework for identifying intervention areas where systemic issues can be addressed
- Process for mapping highest potential opportunities with stakeholder alignment
- Guidance for developing comprehensive intervention mapping documents
- Integration with broader case study development process

**Output**: Intervention Mapping document with clear implementation pathways

**Builds On**: Discovery Process Workflow outputs and stakeholder engagement

### Case Study Synthesis Workflow *(Planned for Phase 2)*
**Purpose**: Process for combining Discovery Report + Intervention Mapping + Implementation Retrospective into final case studies

**Key Components** *(To be developed)*:
- Three-stage synthesis methodology
- Claude Desktop + MCP integration for document processing
- SuperBenefit knowledge base integration approaches
- Visual documentation and quality review processes

## Workflow Relationships

The workflows are designed to support the complete case study development cycle:

```
Discovery Process Workflow
    ↓ (produces Discovery Report)
Intervention Development Framework  
    ↓ (produces Intervention Mapping)
[Implementation Phase - facilitated by mapping]
    ↓ (produces Implementation Retrospective)
Case Study Synthesis Workflow
    ↓ (produces final Case Study)
```

### Workflow Integration

**Discovery to Intervention Development**:
- System maps inform intervention opportunity identification
- Stakeholder interests guide pathway selection  
- Systemic issues become focus areas for intervention design
- Web3 pattern connections suggest implementation approaches

**Intervention Development to Implementation**:
- Intervention mapping provides clear implementation roadmap
- Resource requirements and timelines guide practical execution
- Risk assessments prepare for challenges and mitigation
- Success metrics provide framework for outcome tracking

**All Workflows to Case Study Synthesis**:
- Discovery provides background context and system understanding
- Intervention Development explains approach and methodology selection
- Implementation Retrospective supplies journey documentation and outcomes
- Synthesis combines all elements into comprehensive case study

## Usage Guidelines

### Workflow Adaptation
While workflows provide systematic approaches, they should be adapted based on:

**Organizational Context**: Different organization types may require modified facilitation approaches or stakeholder engagement strategies

**Time and Resource Constraints**: Workflows can be compressed or extended based on available facilitation time and stakeholder availability

**Existing Knowledge**: If substantial system understanding already exists, discovery can focus on validation and gap-filling rather than comprehensive exploration

**Stakeholder Preferences**: Some groups prefer more structured approaches while others work better with emergent facilitation

### Facilitation Requirements

**Discovery Process Workflow**:
- Requires facilitator comfortable with systems mapping and stakeholder engagement
- Benefits from familiarity with web3 patterns and decentralized governance concepts
- Ideal facilitator has experience with sense-making processes and group dynamics

**Intervention Development Framework**:
- Requires strategic thinking and practical implementation planning skills
- Benefits from understanding of web3 technologies and implementation approaches
- Ideal facilitator can bridge between conceptual frameworks and practical execution

### Quality Standards

All workflow outputs should meet standards for:

**Stakeholder Engagement**: Authentic participation from diverse perspectives across the system being mapped

**System Understanding**: Accurate and agreed-upon mapping of current state with clear identification of intervention opportunities

**Practical Viability**: Intervention planning that considers realistic resource requirements, timelines, and stakeholder capacity

**Knowledge Integration**: Outputs that connect meaningfully to SuperBenefit's patterns, playbooks, and broader knowledge ecosystem

## Integration with Templates

Each workflow is supported by corresponding templates in the `/templates/` directory:

- **Discovery Process Workflow** → uses **Discovery Report Template**
- **Intervention Development Framework** → uses **Intervention Mapping Template**
- **Case Study Synthesis Workflow** → uses **Implementation Retrospective Template** plus synthesis methods

Workflows provide the facilitation process while templates provide the documentation structure. Used together, they ensure both effective process execution and comprehensive documentation.

## Supporting Resources

### Tools Directory
The `/tools/` directory contains facilitation resources that support workflow execution:
- Sense-making facilitation tools for deepening system understanding
- Process selection guidance for different organizational contexts
- Integration resources for SuperBenefit knowledge ecosystem

### Examples and References
- Completed case studies (like RPP Governance Design) demonstrate workflow outcomes
- SuperBenefit pattern library provides web3 approach references
- Existing system mapping examples offer guidance for discovery facilitation

## Getting Started

1. **Review template outputs**: Understand what each workflow produces by examining the corresponding templates
2. **Assess organizational readiness**: Determine stakeholder availability and engagement capacity
3. **Select appropriate depth**: Choose workflow intensity based on time, resources, and organizational context
4. **Prepare facilitation resources**: Gather tools, examples, and supporting materials before beginning
5. **Plan workflow sequence**: Ensure adequate time between stages for synthesis and stakeholder review

## Future Development

The workflow collection will be enhanced with:
- **Case Study Synthesis Workflow**: Comprehensive process for combining all three stages into final case studies
- **Implementation Facilitation Guidance**: Support for the implementation phase between intervention mapping and retrospective
- **Visual Documentation Standards**: Approaches for creating system diagrams, process flows, and outcome visualizations
- **Integration Automation**: Tools for connecting case study outputs to SuperBenefit knowledge base patterns and playbooks
