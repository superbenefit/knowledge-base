# Template Refinement Workflow - Final Alignment Steps

This workflow provides focused prompts to complete the remaining alignment opportunities identified in the verification assessment. Each step targets specific files with concise additions that enhance SuperBenefit integration without significantly expanding document length.

## Guidelines for Implementation

- **Length Control**: Replace existing sentences rather than adding new paragraphs where possible
- **Integration Approach**: Weave concepts into existing sections rather than creating new major sections
- **Targeted Updates**: Focus on 2-3 strategic additions per file maximum
- **Universal Applicability**: Maintain language that serves all DAOs, not just SuperBenefit

## Step 1: Network Evolution Mechanisms

**Target Files**: `README.md`, `policies/operations/index.md`

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Please review these files and make 2-3 concise additions that explain how cellular network structures enable organic evolution around new opportunities. Focus on:

1. How cells can reorganize around emerging opportunities without requiring top-down restructuring
2. How resource flows naturally redirect toward high-potential areas within the network
3. How this differs from traditional organizational change management

Keep additions to 1-2 sentences per concept, integrating them into existing paragraphs rather than creating new sections. File length should not increase significantly.

```

## Step 2: Emergence and Design Balance

**Target Files**: `governance.md`, `policies/metagovernance/index.md`

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Please enhance these governance files with concise explanations of how designed governance primitives enable emergent coordination. Address:

1. The relationship between explicit governance frameworks and spontaneous network coordination
2. How clear primitives create conditions for emergence rather than predetermining outcomes
3. Examples of what emerges vs. what is designed

Limit additions to replacing existing sentences or adding brief clauses to existing paragraphs. The goal is clarification, not expansion.

## Step 3: Inter-Network Coordination

**Target Files**: `agreements/index.md`, `policies/index.md`

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Please add 1-2 brief mentions of how networks coordinate with external networks and partners. Include:

1. How agreement frameworks extend beyond organizational boundaries
2. Reference to DAOs as nodes in larger ecosystems
3. How network coordination differs from traditional partnership models

These should be integrated as brief additions (phrases or single sentences) within existing paragraphs about network relationships.

## Step 4: Technical Integration Clarity

**Target Files**: `index.md`, `governance.md`

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Please add concise language connecting technical infrastructure to network coordination capabilities. Address:

1. How on-chain mechanisms enable decentralized coordination
2. The relationship between smart contracts and governance agreements
3. How technical primitives support network intelligence

Integrate these concepts through strategic word replacements and brief clause additions rather than new paragraphs. Focus on making existing technical references more explicit about their coordination function.

```

## Step 5: Verification Review

**Target Files**: All updated files

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Please review all the updated files to ensure:

1. SuperBenefit concepts are well-integrated without overwhelming the universal template purpose
2. Document lengths haven't increased significantly
3. Language remains accessible to new DAO implementers
4. The network-based governance vision is coherent across all files

Provide a brief assessment of the final alignment quality and identify any remaining inconsistencies or areas where language could be more concise.

[Provide all updated files for review]
```

## Implementation Notes

- Execute each step sequentially in separate Claude sessions
- Review outputs before proceeding to ensure length control is maintained
- Focus on enhancing clarity of existing concepts rather than adding new ones
- The goal is to complete the alignment without making documents unwieldy for implementers

## Success Criteria

After completing this workflow:
- Network evolution concepts are present but concise
- Emergence mechanisms are clarified without over-explanation
- Inter-network coordination is acknowledged appropriately
- Technical integration is more explicit but not overwhelming
- Overall document coherence and usability is maintained or improved
