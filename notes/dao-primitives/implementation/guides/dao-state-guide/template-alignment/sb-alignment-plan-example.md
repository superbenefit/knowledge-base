# Plan for Aligning State Template with SuperBenefit Knowledge Base

After reviewing the available tools, I'll use `filesystem-mcp` for working with the local files and `obsidian-mcp-tools` for accessing the knowledge base content. I'll structure this as a carefully sequenced three-step plan with specific prompts for each step.

## Step 1: Comprehensive Analysis and Comparison

**Prompt for comprehensive analysis:**

```
I need to conduct a deep analysis of SuperBenefit's governance language and conceptual patterns to align the state template with our established approach.

Please use obsidian-mcp-tools to search the knowledge base and analyze:
1. Key governance concepts from the Network Evolution article series
2. Core terminology in the /tags/ directory related to governance
3. Language patterns in SuperBenefit's governance discussions

Then, use filesystem-mcp to analyze the state template structure at F:\projects\sb-state-template, focusing on:
1. Current language, tone, and conceptual frameworks
2. Organizational structures and relationships between components
3. Generic governance patterns that should remain universal

Create a structured comparison that identifies:
- Conceptual overlaps where terminology differs
- SuperBenefit patterns that could enhance the template without making it SuperBenefit-specific
- Areas where the state template uses generic language that should be preserved
- Governance approaches unique to SuperBenefit that inform but shouldn't override the template's universality

Use extended thinking to deeply process both repositories before providing your analysis.
```

## Step 2: Bridge Method Creation

**Prompt for creating the bridge method:**

```
Based on the previous analysis of SuperBenefit's knowledge base and the state template, please create a practical method for integrating SuperBenefit's governance concepts and language into the template while maintaining its universal applicability.

Develop a structured approach that:
1. Maps equivalent concepts between repositories
2. Identifies key SuperBenefit principles that enhance the template without restricting its use
3. Creates language adaptation guidelines (terminology shifts, conceptual framing, etc.)
4. Establishes which elements should remain generic vs. which should adopt SuperBenefit's approach

For each category of change:
- Provide clear criteria for determining when to adapt language
- Include specific examples of before/after transformations
- Explain the reasoning behind each transformation type

This bridge method will be applied systematically to update the template repository in the next step. Focus on creating a methodical approach that could be used by anyone seeking to align the template with SuperBenefit's governance philosophy.

Use extended thinking to develop a comprehensive methodology that's both systematic and nuanced.
```

## Step 3: Template Repository Updates

### 3A: Root Directory Updates

**Prompt for root directory updates:**

```
Let's begin updating the state template to align with SuperBenefit's governance language. For this session, we'll focus only on the root directory files.

Please use filesystem-mcp to:
1. Read the current content of the following files in F:\projects\sb-state-template:
   - README.md
   - index.md
   - governance.md
   - Any other root-level documentation files (excluding CONTRIBUTING.md and constitution.md)

2. Apply our bridge method to each file, integrating SuperBenefit's language patterns and governance concepts while maintaining the template's universal applicability.

3. For each file, create an artifact with the proposed changes for my review before saving.

Be particularly attentive to:
- Incorporating network evolution concepts where relevant
- Adopting SuperBenefit's approach to distributed governance
- Reflecting the cellular, fractal nature of organizational structure
- Embracing both Dynamic One and Dynamic Two scaling concepts from SuperBenefit's articles

Use extended thinking to craft thoughtful revisions that maintain each document's purpose while enhancing its alignment with SuperBenefit's governance philosophy.
```

### 3B: Agreements Directory Updates

**Prompt for agreements directory updates:**

```
Let's continue updating the state template to align with SuperBenefit's governance language. For this session, we'll focus only on the agreements directory.

Please use filesystem-mcp to:
1. Read the current content of the following files in F:\projects\sb-state-template\agreements:
   - readme.md
   - index.md
   - Files in community and dao subdirectories (particularly index.md and readme.md files)

2. Apply our bridge method to each file, integrating SuperBenefit's concepts of:
   - Purpose-aligned networks
   - Cell-based organization
   - Agreements as coordination mechanisms
   - Values-driven governance

3. For each file, create an artifact with the proposed changes for my review before saving.

Be particularly attentive to:
- Reflecting SuperBenefit's understanding of agreements as the foundation for network coordination
- Incorporating language about purpose alignment and networked autonomy
- Distinguishing between different types of agreements in ways that align with SuperBenefit's approach

Use extended thinking to craft thoughtful revisions that maintain each document's purpose while enhancing its alignment with SuperBenefit's governance philosophy.
```

### 3C: Policies Directory Updates

**Prompt for policies directory updates:**

```
Let's continue updating the state template to align with SuperBenefit's governance language. For this session, we'll focus only on the policies directory.

Please use filesystem-mcp to:
1. Read the current content of the following files in F:\projects\sb-state-template\policies:
   - readme.md
   - index.md
   - Files in subdirectories (particularly metagovernance, operations, and platforms)

2. Apply our bridge method to each file, integrating SuperBenefit's concepts of:
   - Two-house governance (Community Governance & Operational Governance)
   - Governance at different scales (collaboration, coordination, constituency)
   - Permissionless-ness and emergent strategy
   - Dynamic One and Dynamic Two scaling patterns

3. For each file, create an artifact with the proposed changes for my review before saving.

Be particularly attentive to:
- Incorporating SuperBenefit's scaled governance approach
- Reflecting the distinction between community and operational governance domains
- Emphasizing the cellular, fractal nature of operational structures

Use extended thinking to craft thoughtful revisions that maintain each document's purpose while enhancing its alignment with SuperBenefit's governance philosophy.
```

### 3D: Archive Directory Updates

**Prompt for archive directory updates:**

```
Let's complete the state template updates by focusing on the archive directory.

Please use filesystem-mcp to:
1. Read the current content of the following files in F:\projects\sb-state-template\archive:
   - readme.md
   - index.md
   - Files in any subdirectories (particularly proposals)

2. Apply our bridge method to each file, integrating SuperBenefit's concepts of:
   - Transparency in network governance
   - Historical decision context
   - Accountability in distributed systems

3. For each file, create an artifact with the proposed changes for my review before saving.

Be particularly attentive to:
- Incorporating SuperBenefit's approach to transparency and collective memory
- Reflecting the importance of proposal history in evolving governance
- Emphasizing the role of archives in maintaining purpose alignment

Use extended thinking to craft thoughtful revisions that maintain each document's purpose while enhancing its alignment with SuperBenefit's governance philosophy.
```

## Step 4: Alignment Verification

**Prompt for final verification:**

```
Now that we've updated all sections of the state template, please conduct a comprehensive review to verify alignment with SuperBenefit's governance philosophy while maintaining universal applicability.

Please:
1. Use filesystem-mcp to review the updated state template files
2. Use obsidian-mcp-tools to compare with key SuperBenefit governance concepts
3. Verify that we've successfully:
   - Integrated SuperBenefit's governance language patterns
   - Incorporated key concepts from the Network Evolution series
   - Maintained universal applicability for other DAOs
   - Preserved the template's original purpose and structure

Identify any remaining areas that could benefit from further alignment, as well as any instances where we may have made the template too SuperBenefit-specific.

Use extended thinking to carefully evaluate both language patterns and conceptual frameworks across both repositories.
```
