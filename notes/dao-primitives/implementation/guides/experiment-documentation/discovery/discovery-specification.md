# Discovery Specification

## Required Elements of a Discovery Report

A complete Discovery Report captures essential organizational context, system understanding, and collaborative opportunities through systematic documentation. The report serves multiple stakeholders while establishing foundation insights for subsequent phases.

### Core Required Elements

**Organizational Context**
- Organization type, location, mission, and core activities
- Key stakeholders and their relationships
- Current governance and decision-making structures
- Organizational culture and values alignment

**System Mapping**
- Current organizational structures and processes
- Information and resource flow patterns
- External relationship networks and dependencies
- Technology and infrastructure landscape

**Challenge Identification**
- Systemic issues affecting organizational effectiveness
- Power dynamics and coordination challenges
- Resource allocation or efficiency concerns
- Communication and transparency gaps

**Interest Area Exploration**
- Areas where new approaches might be relevant
- Questions that emerged through discovery conversations
- Potential alignment with decentralized coordination patterns
- Stakeholder readiness for exploration or experimentation

**Pattern Connections**
- Relevant examples from similar organizations or contexts
- Connection to existing knowledge base and case studies
- Potential learning communities or collaboration opportunities
