# Discovery Documentation

Understanding the organization's current context, challenges, and what people are curious about exploring.

## What Makes Good Discovery Documentation

Good discovery documentation captures the real story of an organization - not just its structure and processes, but the energy, challenges, and curiosities that make it unique. The best Discovery Reports help readers truly understand the organization's context while revealing opportunities for meaningful change. They balance comprehensive understanding with readability, serving both the organization's immediate needs and contributing insights others can learn from.

## Common Patterns in Effective Discovery

The most useful Discovery Reports tell a coherent story about the organization that feels true to the people who live it. They surface systemic patterns rather than just listing problems. They capture genuine curiosity about what might be possible, not just what needs fixing. And they create natural bridges to exploration - readers finish them understanding not just where the organization is, but where it might go.

These documents work best when they include enough context for outsiders to understand the situation, but stay focused on what matters most for moving forward. They balance multiple perspectives without trying to resolve all contradictions. Most importantly, they capture the human side of organizational life - the relationships, frustrations, and aspirations that drive everything else.

## Key Principles

- **Listen deeply** - The best insights come from really hearing what people are saying (and not saying)
- **Look for patterns** - Individual problems often point to systemic issues
- **Capture curiosity** - Document not just problems but what people wonder about
- **Stay grounded** - Focus on how things actually work, not how they should work
