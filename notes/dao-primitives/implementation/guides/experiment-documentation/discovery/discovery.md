# Discovery Phase Overview

The Discovery phase establishes the foundation for experimental documentation by systematically gathering information about organizational context, challenges, and opportunities. This phase creates the base information that all subsequent phases build upon through human-AI collaborative documentation.

## Purpose and Outcomes

**Primary Purpose**: Create comprehensive organizational understanding that serves as foundation for all subsequent experimental documentation phases through efficient human-AI collaboration.

**Key Outcomes**:
- **Organizational Profile**: Complete understanding of structure, mission, and operational context
- **System Mapping**: Documentation of current processes, resource flows, and relationship patterns
- **Challenge Analysis**: Systematic identification of systemic issues and root causes
- **Interest Area Discovery**: Organic identification of areas for potential new approaches
- **Readiness Assessment**: Evaluation of organizational capacity for experimental activities
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Clear understanding of stakeholder perspectives and engagement readiness

## Human-AI Collaboration Innovation

This phase implements a collaborative documentation model where humans focus on stakeholder engagement and information gathering while AI assists with synthesis and structure development. This ensures high-quality, consistent documentation regardless of facilitator experience level.

**Process Flow**: Review Specification → Human Information Gathering → AI Synthesis → AI Quality Review → Final Documentation

## Documents in This Phase

### Core Documents
- **[discovery-specification.md](discovery-specification.md)** - Defines required elements and quality criteria for Discovery Reports
- **[discovery-worksheet.md](discovery-worksheet.md)** - Progressive information gathering tool with 8 aligned sections
- **[discovery-template.md](discovery-template.md)** - Structure for organizing Discovery Report content with AI synthesis integration
- **[discovery-workflow.md](discovery-workflow.md)** - Human-AI collaboration process with copy-paste ready AI prompts

### Document Alignment System
- **Perfect Alignment**: 8 worksheet sections ↔️ 8 template sections ↔️ 8 AI synthesis prompts
- **Quality Assurance**: 6 AI prompts for comprehensive quality review and enhancement
- **Process Visualization**: Mermaid diagrams showing workflow options and information flow
- **Time Optimization**: Each AI prompt designed for 5-10 minutes of focused collaboration

## Workflow Options

**Intensive Workshop Approach** (2-4 weeks): Collaborative stakeholder engagement with concentrated information gathering  
**Extended Conversation Approach** (4-8 weeks): Individual stakeholder conversations with progressive documentation  
**Hybrid Research Approach** (3-5 weeks): Document review combined with targeted stakeholder inquiry

## Relationship to Other Phases

**Foundation for All Phases**: Discovery provides baseline organizational understanding that eliminates redundant information gathering in subsequent phases.

**Progressive Documentation**: Information captured here builds efficiently into Intervention mapping, Reflection documentation, and Synthesis development.

**AI-Assisted Handoffs**: Structured information from Discovery worksheets enables smooth AI-assisted synthesis in later phases.

## Quality Standards

**Completeness**: All organizational systems, challenges, and interests systematically documented  
**Accuracy**: System mapping reflects actual rather than aspirational organizational state  
**Authenticity**: Interest areas emerged organically from stakeholder conversations  
**Utility**: Documentation provides clear foundation for intervention mapping and future experimental work  
**Multi-Stakeholder Value**: Content serves organizational clarity, facilitator understanding, and knowledge commons contribution
