# Discovery Exploration Guide

This guide helps you gather insights about organizational context, challenges, and curiosities. Use it as a conversation starter, not a form to fill out. Capture information in whatever way feels natural - notes, recordings, drawings, or any format that helps you think.

## Organizational Context

*Why this matters: Understanding the organization's story and current reality helps ground all future exploration in what's actually happening rather than what we imagine.*

Consider exploring:
- What's the organization's origin story and how has it evolved?
- What does the organization care most deeply about?
- How do people describe the culture here?
- What external forces are shaping the organization right now?

## How Things Actually Work

*Why this matters: The official structure rarely tells the whole story. Understanding how decisions really get made and work actually flows reveals opportunities for meaningful change.*

Consider exploring:
- How do decisions actually get made here (not how they're supposed to)?
- Where does information get stuck or flow freely?
- Which relationships and connections matter most?
- What are the unwritten rules everyone knows?

## Current Challenges

*Why this matters: Identifying patterns in what's not working helps focus energy where change could make the biggest difference. Look for systemic issues, not just surface problems.*

Consider exploring:
- What keeps coming up in conversations as frustrating or broken?
- Where do people feel stuck or powerless?
- What would people fix first if they had a magic wand?
- How do these challenges connect to each other?

## Stakeholder Perspectives

*Why this matters: Different people experience the organization differently. Understanding multiple viewpoints reveals the full picture and helps ensure changes work for everyone.*

Consider exploring:
- Who's affected by how things currently work?
- What matters most to different groups?
- Where do perspectives align or clash?
- Who has influence (formal or informal) over change?

## Curiosities and Possibilities

*Why this matters: The most powerful changes often come from following genuine curiosity rather than prescribed solutions. What people wonder about reveals where energy for exploration exists.*

Consider exploring:
- What are people genuinely curious about trying?
- What "what if" questions keep coming up?
- Where do people see potential they're excited about?
- What examples from elsewhere spark interest?

## Readiness for Change

*Why this matters: Understanding capacity and appetite for change helps design approaches that match reality rather than overwhelming or underwhelming the organization.*

Consider exploring:
- What's the organization's history with change efforts?
- Where does energy and enthusiasm for new approaches exist?
- What resources (time, money, attention) are realistically available?
- What fears or concerns need to be acknowledged?

## Patterns and Connections

*Why this matters: Stepping back to see patterns helps identify leverage points where small changes might create bigger shifts.*

Consider exploring:
- What themes keep emerging across conversations?
- How do different challenges connect to each other?
- Where might addressing one issue help with others?
- What systemic patterns are becoming visible?

## Next Steps and Questions

*Why this matters: Discovery often raises as many questions as it answers. Capturing what you're still wondering about guides continued exploration.*

Consider:
- What questions emerged that you want to explore further?
- Who else should you talk to?
- What documents or data might provide additional insight?
- What are you most curious to understand better?
