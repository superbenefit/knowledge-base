# Framework Guide

## Progressive Documentation Approach

This framework builds knowledge systematically - each phase adds new layers while carrying forward relevant insights from previous work. Discovery challenges inform intervention possibilities, interventions generate outcomes for reflection, and reflections reveal patterns for broader understanding. This eliminates duplication while maintaining natural connections between engagement phases.

## Framework Flexibility

The framework deliberately avoids prescribing specific engagement methods, facilitation approaches, or organizational structures. It provides information architecture and document structures that work with various approaches while maintaining knowledge coherence.

### What the Framework Provides
- **Information architecture** that captures essential insights regardless of how they're gathered
- **Document structures** that work with various engagement styles and timelines
- **Progressive workflows** that build knowledge efficiently across different approaches
- **Quality standards** that ensure completeness without dictating methods

### What the Framework Doesn't Prescribe
- Specific facilitation methodologies or engagement techniques
- Required meeting structures or communication platforms
- Predetermined timelines or phase durations
- Particular tools or technologies for documentation

This flexibility allows facilitators to use whatever approaches work best for their context while still contributing to a coherent knowledge base that serves multiple stakeholders.

## Document Type Relationships

The framework organizes materials into four complementary document types that work together to support effective knowledge capture:

### Specifications - The "What"
Specifications define the required elements and quality criteria for each phase's outputs. They answer questions like "What should a Discovery Report contain?" and "How do we know if our Intervention Map is complete?" Specifications provide consistency standards while remaining flexible about how those standards are met.

### Worksheets - The "Capture"
Worksheets serve as practical information gathering tools designed for progressive completion over multiple sessions. Each worksheet builds on insights from previous phases, carrying forward relevant information while adding new dimensions. They're designed to be working documents that evolve throughout an engagement rather than one-time forms to complete.

### Templates - The "Structure"
Templates provide document organization patterns that align with specifications and incorporate information from worksheets. They offer starting structures that can be customized for specific projects while maintaining consistency for knowledge sharing. Templates include guidance comments and prompts that reference relevant worksheet sections.

### Workflows - The "How"
Workflows offer process guidance for moving through each phase effectively. They provide options for different engagement styles and contexts rather than rigid step-by-step procedures. Workflows help facilitators adapt the framework to their specific situation while ensuring important elements aren't overlooked.

## Best Practices for Framework Use

### Start with Context, Not Structure
Begin each phase by understanding the specific context and needs rather than immediately diving into templates. Use the worksheets to gather information organically, then organize insights using the templates. The framework should serve your engagement, not constrain it.

### Build Incrementally
Take advantage of the progressive nature by regularly reviewing and building on previous work. Each phase should feel like a natural extension of the previous one rather than starting from scratch. Use internal linking to connect related insights across phases.

### Maintain Multiple Perspectives
Remember that the framework serves three primary stakeholder groups - the participating organization, SuperBenefit as facilitator, and the broader commons seeking to learn from experiments. Consider how each document serves these different audiences while maintaining efficiency.

### Customize Appropriately
The framework provides starting points, not rigid requirements. Adapt document structures, add relevant sections, and modify workflows to match your specific engagement. Document your adaptations to help others learn from your experience.

### Focus on Knowledge Transfer
The ultimate goal is creating insights that can be shared, learned from, and built upon. Consider how future readers will access and understand the knowledge you're capturing. Write for discoverability and comprehension, not just immediate project needs.

## Document Integration with Project Work

The documentation framework can integrate with any existing project methodology or timeline. Rather than prescribing project management approaches, it provides documentation patterns that intersect with typical engagement phases:

**Discovery documentation** typically aligns with early project exploration and stakeholder engagement activities.

**Intervention documentation** supports planning and design phases where possibilities are being mapped and evaluated.

**Reflection documentation** captures learning throughout implementation and at project milestones.

**Synthesis documentation** creates knowledge assets from completed work that can inform future efforts.

### Organizational Context Adaptations

**Established Organizations**
- Focus Discovery on system mapping and change readiness
- Intervention phase emphasizes integration with existing structures
- Reflection captures organizational learning and culture shifts

**Emerging Collectives**
- Discovery explores identity formation and governance needs
- Intervention maps community development possibilities
- Reflection documents collective evolution and decision-making patterns

**Network Organizations**
- Discovery maps relationship structures and communication patterns
- Intervention focuses on coordination mechanisms and shared resources
- Reflection captures network effects and emergent behaviors

### Facilitator Style Variations

**Structured Facilitation**
- Use worksheets as session agendas and structured activities
- Complete templates through guided processes
- Regular milestone check-ins against specifications

**Organic Facilitation**
- Use worksheets as background reference for informal conversations
- Capture insights in templates as they emerge naturally
- Allow phases to overlap and flow organically

**Collaborative Facilitation**
- Share worksheet completion across team members
- Co-create templates through collective editing
- Distribute workflow responsibilities among participants



## Implementation Guidelines

**Setup:** Review framework structure, copy relevant templates to your working directory, adapt worksheets for your specific context.

**Usage:** Build on previous phase insights, connect related information across phases, maintain focus on multiple stakeholder perspectives.

**Adaptation:** Customize document structures for your engagement, document your modifications for others to learn from.
