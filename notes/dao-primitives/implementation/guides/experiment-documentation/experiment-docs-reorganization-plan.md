# Experiment Documentation Framework Reorganization Plan - UPDATED

## Quick Setup for Tonight's Implementation

### Before Starting:
1. **Create the folder structure** in your local Obsidian vault:
   ```
   F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\notes\dao-primitives\implementation\guides\experiment-documentation\
   ```
2. **Open 6 Claude browser tabs** - one for each phase
3. **Keep this plan open** in a separate window for reference
4. **Have your Obsidian vault open** to verify file creation
5. **File naming**: Use exact filenames as specified in prompts (including underscores for folder notes)

### During Implementation:
- Copy each prompt exactly as written
- Check off completed prompts in the checklist
- Save phase completion summaries back to this plan
- Move to the next phase chat after updating insights
- **Note**: Some prompts reference files created in earlier prompts - if a transcluded file doesn't exist yet, Claude will adapt

## Current Progress Summary

**Completed Phases:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Framework Overview (4 documents)

## Phase Completion Updates

### Phase 1 Insights

**Completed Documents:**
- `_README.md` - Comprehensive system overview with Mermaid information flow diagram
- `framework-guide.md` - Streamlined philosophy and implementation guidance
- `information-flow.md` - Detailed phase relationships and information transfer patterns
- `_experiment-documentation.md` - Main navigation hub with complete file structure

**Key Adaptations:**
- **Removed user initialization guide** - Determined to be outside scope as it made project management assumptions
- **Eliminated project management content** - Stripped all timeline assumptions, milestone tracking, and project planning guidance
- **Streamlined philosophy** - Reduced abstract concepts in favor of practical guidance
- **Focused on documentation patterns** - Framework now purely provides documentation structure that can intersect with any project approach

### Phase 2 Insights

**Completed Documents:**
- `_discovery.md` - Discovery phase folder note with purpose, outcomes, and navigation
- `discovery-specification.md` - Required elements and quality criteria for Discovery Reports
- `discovery-worksheet.md` - Progressive information gathering tool with 15 sections
- `discovery-workflow.md` - Flexible process guidance with 3 workflow options
- `discovery-template.md` - Structured template for organizing Discovery Report content

**Key Adaptations Made:**
- **Major refactoring of discovery-workflow.md** - Removed prescriptive methodologies while maintaining valuable process guidance
- **Method-agnostic approach achieved** - All documents now work across different engagement styles and organizational contexts
- **Progressive documentation implemented** - Worksheet builds incrementally, template references worksheet sections
- **Multi-stakeholder value maintained** - All documents serve organization, facilitator, and knowledge commons needs

### Phase 3 Restoration (Post-Plan Update)

**Intervention Phase Fully Restored:**
- **Complete Documentation Suite Created**: All 5 documents (folder note, specification, worksheet, template, workflow)
- **Valuable Structure Preserved**: System intervention points, pattern matching, resource assessment, risk frameworks
- **Method-Agnostic Achieved**: Removed prescriptive elements while maintaining strategic documentation guidance
- **AI Integration Added**: 7 synthesis prompts plus 3 quality review prompts matching other phases

**Key Elements Restored:**
- Comprehensive 8-section intervention mapping structure

### Phase 6 Insights
*To be updated after Phase 6 completion*

### Final Implementation Notes
*To be updated after full implementation*

## Key Principles Maintained and Evolved

- **Progressive**: Each phase builds on previous work without duplicating information gathering
- **Agnostic**: No prescribed methods or timelines - framework intersects with existing approaches
- **Efficient**: Minimal overhead, maximum value through AI-assisted synthesis
- **Flexible**: Adapts to different contexts and reflection types
- **Integrated**: Connects to broader knowledge ecosystem and pattern libraries
- **Human-AI Collaborative**: Humans gather insights, AI synthesizes documentation
- **Documentation-Focused**: Pure documentation patterns rather than process prescription
- **Quality-Assured**: Built-in quality review processes for consistent high standards

## Next Steps

Only Phase 6 (Supporting Resources) remains to complete the framework reorganization. This phase will add:
- Progressive documentation principles
- Tools guide (optional resources)
- Implementation plan template
- Final cleanup and archiving
