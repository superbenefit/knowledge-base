# Legacy Documentation Archive

## Overview

This folder contains documentation from previous versions of the Experiment Documentation Framework. These materials have been preserved for reference but are superseded by the reorganized framework structure.

## Archive Contents

### Old Original Structure (`old-original-structure/`)
Contains the initial folder organization before the framework reorganization:
- **discovery/** - Original discovery phase documents
- **intervention/** - Original intervention phase documents  
- **reflection/** - Original reflection phase documents
- **synthesis/** - Original synthesis phase documents

These folders contain valuable content that informed the new framework but used a less systematic approach.

### Individual Archived Files
- **intervention-placeholder-template.md** - Temporary placeholder used during reorganization
- **02-intervention-old.md** - Previous intervention folder note
- **04-synthesis-old.md** - Previous synthesis folder note

## Why These Materials Were Archived

### Methodology Prescriptiveness
Many original documents contained specific methodological requirements (like Estuarine Mapping) that limited the framework's flexibility. The new framework maintains valuable guidance while removing prescriptive elements.

### Project Management Overlap
Original documents often mixed documentation guidance with project management, creating confusion about the framework's purpose. The reorganized framework focuses purely on documentation patterns.

### Inconsistent Structure
The original organization lacked consistent structure across phases. The new framework provides uniform organization with specifications, worksheets, templates, and workflows for each phase.

### Limited Progressive Documentation
Earlier versions didn't fully implement progressive documentation principles, leading to redundant information gathering. The new framework ensures information flows forward without duplication.

## Valuable Elements Preserved

While these documents are archived, their valuable content has been preserved in the new framework:

1. **System Mapping Concepts** - Incorporated into Discovery phase
2. **Power Dynamics Analysis** - Integrated into Intervention documentation
3. **Pattern Matching Approaches** - Maintained throughout framework
4. **Multi-Stakeholder Perspectives** - Enhanced across all phases
5. **Case Study Synthesis Methods** - Expanded in new Synthesis workflow

## Using Archived Materials

These documents may still be useful for:
- Understanding the framework's evolution
- Extracting specific examples or language
- Comparing approaches between versions
- Historical reference

However, **always use the current framework documents** for active experiment documentation.

## Migration Notes

The reorganization occurred to:
1. Create consistent structure across all phases
2. Implement true progressive documentation
3. Remove prescriptive methodologies
4. Integrate AI-assisted synthesis throughout
5. Improve navigation and usability

All essential content from these archived documents has been incorporated into the new framework with improvements based on user feedback and practical application.
