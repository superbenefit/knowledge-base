# Discovery Phase

## Purpose and Outcomes

The Discovery phase establishes a foundational understanding of organizational context, current systems, and collaborative opportunities. Through systematic information gathering and stakeholder exploration, this phase produces insights that inform all subsequent work while serving multiple audiences with distinct value propositions.

Discovery work generates a comprehensive **Discovery Report** that captures organizational systems, identifies systemic challenges, and explores areas of mutual interest for potential collaboration or experimentation.

### Key Outcomes
- **System Understanding**: Clear mapping of current organizational structures, processes, and relationships
- **Challenge Identification**: Documentation of systemic issues and opportunity areas
- **Interest Exploration**: Areas where new approaches might align with organizational needs
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Shared understanding of context and possibilities among participants
- **Foundation Setting**: Baseline insights that inform intervention mapping and implementation planning

## Discovery Documents

### Core Documentation
- **[[discovery-specification]]** - Defines required elements and quality criteria for Discovery Reports
- **[[discovery-worksheet]]** - Progressive information gathering tool for capturing insights across multiple sessions
- **[[discovery-template]]** - Structured format for organizing Discovery Report content
- **[[discovery-workflow]]** - Flexible process guidance for conducting Discovery activities

### Document Relationships
The Discovery documents work together as a coherent system: the **specification** establishes what should be captured, the **worksheet** provides practical tools for gathering information, the **template** organizes insights into shareable knowledge, and the **workflow** offers process guidance that adapts to different engagement styles.

## Common Discovery Patterns

Discovery work adapts to various organizational contexts and engagement approaches while maintaining essential knowledge capture:

### Established Organizations
Discovery typically focuses on system mapping, change readiness assessment, and integration possibilities with existing structures. These engagements often benefit from stakeholder interviews, process documentation, and governance analysis.

### Emerging Collectives
Discovery emphasizes identity formation, governance needs exploration, and community development patterns. These contexts often involve participatory sense-making and collaborative visioning activities.

### Network Organizations
Discovery maps relationship structures, communication patterns, and coordination mechanisms across distributed participants. These engagements typically explore network effects and emergent behaviors.

### Timeline Flexibility
Discovery work can range from intensive workshop-based approaches completed in days to extended exploration periods spanning months. The progressive documentation approach accommodates both rapid assessment and deep investigation depending on organizational needs and facilitator style.

## Relationship to Other Phases

Discovery establishes the foundation for all subsequent work while maintaining natural connections to other phases:

### Discovery → Intervention
System understanding and challenge identification directly inform intervention possibility mapping. Stakeholder readiness and organizational context shape intervention feasibility assessment.

### Discovery → Reflection
Baseline insights provide reference points for evaluating change and learning throughout implementation. Initial stakeholder perspectives create comparison frameworks for ongoing retrospectives.

### Discovery → Synthesis
Rich organizational context and challenge documentation provide essential narrative foundation for comprehensive case studies and pattern identification.

### Iterative Relationships
Discovery insights may be revisited and refined during later phases as understanding deepens. New information from implementation often reveals additional system dynamics worth documenting.

## Key Principles for Discovery Work

### Progressive Information Building
Discovery documentation builds knowledge systematically rather than requiring complete information gathering before proceeding. The worksheet approach supports incremental insight capture across multiple touchpoints.

### Multi-Stakeholder Value
Discovery work serves three primary audiences: the participating organization gains clarity on their context and opportunities, facilitators develop implementation understanding, and the broader knowledge commons benefits from documented patterns and approaches.

### Method Agnosticism
Discovery can be conducted through various engagement approaches - structured workshops, informal conversations, individual interviews, collaborative mapping sessions, or hybrid formats. The framework provides information architecture that works across methodologies.

### Context Sensitivity
Effective Discovery work adapts to organizational culture, stakeholder availability, existing documentation, and political dynamics while maintaining essential insight capture standards.

### Future-Oriented Foundation
While documenting current state, Discovery work also explores possibilities and areas of interest that create natural bridges to intervention and implementation phases.

*Discovery phase documentation integrates with existing organizational knowledge while creating new insights that serve multiple learning objectives. The progressive approach ensures efficient knowledge capture without duplicating existing understanding.*
