# Intervention Phase - PLACEHOLDER

*This directory is a placeholder pending further development of intervention documentation needs.*

## Purpose

The Intervention phase should bridge Discovery insights and experimental activities by documenting:
- How Discovery challenges translate into intervention opportunities
- Connections between organizational needs and decentralized coordination patterns
- Strategic decisions about which interventions to pursue and how
- Resource and stakeholder considerations for implementation

## Current Status: INCOMPLETE

This phase requires further development to properly serve the progressive documentation framework. The approach needs to be:
- Less prescriptive than current drafts
- More focused on documentation patterns than strategy development
- Clearly distinct from project management activities
- Better integrated with actual experimental intervention practices

## What Needs to Be Developed

### Core Question
How do we document intervention decisions and strategies in a way that:
- Builds on Discovery findings without duplicating information
- Captures strategic thinking for future reference and learning
- Serves multiple stakeholders (organization, facilitators, knowledge commons)
- Remains method-agnostic about intervention approaches
- Connects to experimental activities without prescribing project management

### Required Documents (To Be Created Later)
- **Intervention documentation specification** - What needs to be captured during intervention design
- **Intervention capture templates** - Flexible templates for documenting intervention decisions
- **Intervention reflection tools** - Ways to document intervention strategy evolution
- **Pattern connection guidance** - How to document connections to decentralized coordination patterns

### Key Design Principles for Future Development
1. **Document decisions, not prescribe processes** - Focus on capturing strategic thinking rather than directing strategy development
2. **Flexible capture methods** - Work with various intervention design approaches rather than requiring specific methods
3. **Progressive information flow** - Clear connections from Discovery insights to experimental planning
4. **Pattern integration** - Seamless connection to decentralized coordination pattern libraries
5. **Learning orientation** - Capture both successful and unsuccessful intervention strategies for knowledge building

## Temporary Workaround

Until this phase is properly developed, experiments can:
- Use the [intervention-placeholder-template.md](notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/experiment-documentation/z-old/intervention-placeholder-template.md) to capture key intervention decisions
- Document intervention decisions in free-form notes that reference Discovery findings
- Capture key strategic choices and rationale for future synthesis
- Note connections to relevant decentralized coordination patterns
- Maintain intervention strategy documentation separate from project management

**Quick Documentation Approach:**
1. Copy the intervention placeholder template for each experiment
2. Fill in basic information about intervention decisions and approaches
3. Reference specific Discovery Report sections that informed decisions
4. Note any decentralized coordination patterns that were applied
5. Keep documentation focused on strategic decisions rather than experimental details

## Next Steps for Development

When ready to properly develop this phase:
1. Review actual intervention documentation needs from real experiments
2. Study how intervention decisions are currently captured and used
3. Design documentation patterns that complement rather than replace existing intervention methods
4. Create templates that capture strategic thinking without prescribing strategy development processes
5. Test documentation approaches with actual intervention activities
