# Information Flow

## Overview

This document details how information moves between phases in the Experiment Documentation Framework, enabling progressive documentation that builds knowledge efficiently without duplication. Understanding these relationships helps users maximize the value of their documentation efforts while maintaining clear connections between different aspects of their engagement.

## Phase-to-Phase Information Flow

### Discovery → Intervention Flow

**What Carries Forward:**
- **Organizational Profile** - Mission, structure, culture, and context insights inform intervention feasibility
- **Challenge/Opportunity Definition** - Specific problems and possibilities identified in Discovery become intervention focus areas
- **Stakeholder Analysis** - Understanding of who is involved, their perspectives, and readiness for change guides intervention design
- **System Mapping** - Current state analysis reveals intervention points and potential unintended consequences
- **Technology Readiness** - Capacity for different types of interventions influences what's possible

**How Information Transfers:**
- Intervention worksheets reference specific Discovery Report sections
- Challenge areas from Discovery become intervention opportunity categories
- Stakeholder readiness assessments inform intervention complexity decisions
- System maps reveal leverage points for intervention design

**Key Decision Points:**
- Is the Discovery understanding sufficient to begin intervention mapping?
- Which Discovery insights are most relevant for intervention design?
- What additional context might be needed for effective intervention planning?

### Intervention → Reflection Flow

**What Carries Forward:**
- **Intervention Plans** - What was attempted, why, and what was expected
- **Success Metrics** - How intervention effectiveness was defined and measured
- **Implementation Approach** - Methods, timeline, and resource allocation used
- **Stakeholder Roles** - Who was involved in implementation and how
- **Risk Assessments** - Anticipated challenges and mitigation strategies

**How Information Transfers:**
- Reflection worksheets begin with intervention plan review
- Success metrics become reflection evaluation criteria
- Stakeholder roles inform who should be involved in reflection activities
- Risk assessments guide what to look for in outcome analysis

**Key Decision Points:**
- When is enough intervention activity complete to warrant reflection?
- How do we balance reflection timing with ongoing intervention work?
- What level of reflection depth is appropriate for the intervention scale?

### Reflection → Synthesis Flow

**What Carries Forward:**
- **Outcome Documentation** - What actually happened versus what was expected
- **Lessons Learned** - Insights about what worked, what didn't, and why
- **Stakeholder Feedback** - Multiple perspectives on intervention effectiveness and experience
- **Unintended Consequences** - Unexpected outcomes both positive and negative
- **Process Insights** - Learning about facilitation, engagement, and collaboration approaches

**How Information Transfers:**
- Synthesis worksheets compile insights from all reflection cycles
- Outcome patterns become case study narrative elements
- Stakeholder quotes provide multiple perspective evidence
- Process insights inform methodology recommendations

**Key Decision Points:**
- When is there sufficient reflection material to create meaningful synthesis?
- Which insights are most valuable for knowledge commons contribution?
- How do we balance detail with accessibility in synthesis?

## Cross-Phase Information Flows

### Discovery → Reflection (Direct Connection)

**Why This Matters:**
- Original challenges and context provide baseline for measuring change
- Stakeholder expectations set during Discovery become reflection evaluation criteria
- System understanding helps identify intervention ripple effects

**Information Transfer:**
- Reflection activities compare current state to Discovery baseline
- Stakeholder perspectives from Discovery inform reflection interview approaches
- System mapping reveals where to look for intervention impacts

### Intervention → Discovery (Feedback Loop)

**Why This Matters:**
- Intervention attempts reveal new understanding about organizational context
- Implementation challenges uncover previously unknown system constraints
- Stakeholder engagement during intervention deepens contextual understanding

**Information Transfer:**
- Intervention learning updates Discovery documentation
- New stakeholder insights enhance original analysis
- System understanding evolves based on intervention attempts

### Reflection → Intervention (Iterative Cycle)

**Why This Matters:**
- Reflection insights inform intervention refinement and new intervention design
- Outcome analysis reveals more effective intervention approaches
- Stakeholder feedback guides intervention approach modifications

**Information Transfer:**
- Reflection outcomes become input for intervention planning updates
- Lessons learned inform new intervention possibility assessment
- Stakeholder feedback shapes intervention approach modifications

## Parallel and Overlapping Phase Patterns

### Discovery and Intervention Overlap

**Common Scenarios:**
- **Emergent Engagement** - Discovery reveals immediate intervention opportunities
- **Iterative Design** - Intervention attempts deepen Discovery understanding
- **Rapid Prototyping** - Quick intervention tests inform broader Discovery work

**Managing Information Flow:**
- Maintain separate Discovery and Intervention documentation while noting connections
- Use cross-references to link related insights
- Regular synthesis of overlapping insights

### Reflection Throughout All Phases

**Common Scenarios:**
- **Ongoing Learning** - Regular reflection cycles during Discovery and Intervention
- **Milestone Reviews** - Reflection at key decision points regardless of phase
- **Stakeholder Feedback** - Continuous input collection throughout engagement

**Managing Information Flow:**
- Date-stamp reflection entries to track evolution
- Connect reflection insights to specific phase activities
- Build cumulative reflection understanding over time

## Information Flow Optimization Strategies

### Preventing Information Duplication

**Strategies:**
- **Reference, Don't Repeat** - Link to previous insights rather than restating them
- **Build, Don't Rebuild** - Add new layers to existing understanding
- **Connect, Don't Copy** - Show relationships between insights across phases

**Practical Techniques:**
- Use internal linking between related sections
- Create summary tables that pull from multiple sources
- Develop templates that prompt for connections to previous work

### Ensuring Information Accessibility

**Strategies:**
- **Tag Key Insights** - Mark important insights for easy retrieval
- **Create Navigation Aids** - Provide clear pathways between related information
- **Maintain Overview Documents** - Keep high-level summaries that show connections

**Practical Techniques:**
- Use consistent tagging systems across phases
- Create index documents that map insights to locations
- Develop visual diagrams showing information relationships

### Managing Information Evolution

**Strategies:**
- **Track Changes** - Document how understanding evolves over time
- **Preserve Context** - Keep original insights while adding new understanding
- **Show Development** - Make learning progression visible

**Practical Techniques:**
- Use version control or change tracking
- Add dated updates to original insights
- Create narrative descriptions of how understanding developed
