# Reflection Phase Overview

The Reflection phase captures learning and insights from experimental activities through systematic documentation of outcomes, challenges, and emerging understanding. This phase can occur multiple times throughout an experiment's lifecycle, building a progressive record of learning and adaptation.

## Purpose and Outcomes

**Primary Purpose**: Document learning from experimental activities to inform ongoing decision-making, future experiments, and knowledge commons contribution. Reflection transforms experience into transferable insights.

**Key Outcomes**:
- **Learning Documentation**: Systematic capture of what worked, what didn't, and why
- **Outcome Assessment**: Documentation of both intended and unexpected results
- **Challenge Analysis**: Understanding of obstacles encountered and responses attempted
- **Stakeholder Insights**: Perspectives from different participants and affected parties
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identification of recurring themes and transferable insights
- **Adaptation Guidance**: Insights that inform ongoing and future experimental activities

## Documents in This Phase

### Core Documents
- **[reflection-specification.md](reflection-specification.md)** - Defines what comprehensive reflection documentation should contain
- **[reflection-worksheet.md](reflection-worksheet.md)** - Progressive tool for capturing reflection insights across multiple sessions
- **[reflection-template.md](reflection-template.md)** - Structure for organizing reflection insights into coherent retrospectives
- **[reflection-workflow.md](reflection-workflow.md)** - Flexible approaches for different reflection contexts and depths

## Types of Reflection

The framework supports various reflection approaches depending on timing and purpose:

### Periodic Reflection
Regular check-ins during ongoing experiments to capture emerging insights and adjust approaches. Often brief and focused on immediate learning.

### Milestone Reflection
Deeper reflection at significant project points such as phase transitions or major decision points. Balances detail with timeliness.

### Challenge-Focused Reflection
Targeted reflection when specific obstacles or unexpected outcomes arise. Focuses on problem-solving and adaptation.

### Final Reflection
Comprehensive retrospective at experiment completion, integrating all previous reflections into complete learning documentation.

### Meta-Reflection
Reflection on the experimental process itself, capturing insights about methodology, facilitation, and engagement approaches.

## Relationship to Other Phases

**Building on Discovery and Intervention**:
- Uses original challenges as reference points for outcome assessment
- Compares actual results to intervention plans and expectations
- Identifies gaps between intended and actual approaches

**Informing Ongoing Work**:
- Provides insights for intervention adaptation
- Identifies needs for additional discovery
- Guides resource reallocation and timeline adjustments

**Contributing to Synthesis**:
- Supplies outcome evidence and impact documentation
- Provides stakeholder quotes and stories
- Documents learning progression over time

## Key Principles

1. **Iterative Documentation**: Multiple reflections build comprehensive understanding
2. **Multi-Stakeholder Perspectives**: Captures diverse viewpoints on outcomes
3. **Honest Assessment**: Documents both successes and challenges authentically
4. **Learning Focus**: Emphasizes insight extraction over judgment
5. **Progressive Building**: Each reflection adds to cumulative understanding

## Getting Started

1. Determine appropriate reflection type for your timing and needs
2. Use the Reflection Worksheet to gather insights systematically
3. Reference the Specification for comprehensiveness
4. Follow the Workflow for your chosen approach
5. Organize findings using the Template

Remember: Reflection is not just evaluation - it's active learning capture that informs adaptation and contributes to collective understanding.
