# Reflection Phase Overview

The Reflection phase captures learning and insights from experimental activities through systematic documentation of outcomes, challenges, and emerging understanding. This phase can occur multiple times throughout an experiment's lifecycle, building a progressive record of learning and adaptation.

## Purpose and Outcomes

**Primary Purpose**: Document learning from experimental activities to inform ongoing decision-making, future experiments, and knowledge commons contribution. Reflection transforms experience into transferable insights.

**Key Outcomes**:
- **Learning Documentation**: Systematic capture of what worked, what didn't, and why
- **Outcome Assessment**: Documentation of both intended and unexpected results
- **Challenge Analysis**: Understanding of obstacles encountered and responses attempted
- **Stakeholder Insights**: Perspectives from different participants and affected parties
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identification of recurring themes and transferable insights
- **Adaptation Guidance**: Insights that inform ongoing and future experimental activities
