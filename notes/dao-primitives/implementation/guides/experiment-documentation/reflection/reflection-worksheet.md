# Reflection Exploration Guide

This guide helps you capture learning as it happens. Use it whenever you want to pause and make sense of what's emerging - after events, during transitions, or when something surprising occurs. There's no required format - capture insights however they come.

## What Happened

*Why this matters: Starting with simple observation of what occurred (before jumping to interpretation) helps ground reflection in shared reality.*

Consider capturing:
- What actually took place?
- How did it unfold differently than expected?
- What moments stand out as significant?
- What did different people experience?

## What Surprised Us

*Why this matters: Surprises are learning opportunities. They show where our assumptions didn't match reality and point to new understanding.*

Consider:
- What caught you off guard (good or bad)?
- Where did things work differently than anticipated?
- What unexpected connections or conflicts emerged?
- What assumptions got challenged?

## What We're Learning

*Why this matters: Extracting insights while they're fresh helps build collective wisdom and inform future action.*

Consider:
- What patterns are you starting to notice?
- What would you do differently knowing what you know now?
- What advice would you give someone else trying something similar?
- What questions are getting answered and what new ones are emerging?

## Different Perspectives

*Why this matters: The same events can mean very different things to different people. Capturing multiple viewpoints reveals the full picture.*

Consider exploring:
- How did various stakeholders experience what happened?
- Where do perspectives align or diverge?
- What insights come from seeing through others' eyes?
- Whose voices might be missing from the reflection?

## Emotional Landscape

*Why this matters: Change work is human work. Acknowledging feelings - frustration, joy, anxiety, hope - helps others prepare for their own journey.*

Consider:
- What emotions showed up during this experience?
- Where did energy rise or fall?
- What felt hard and what felt flowing?
- How are people feeling about what comes next?

## What's Shifting

*Why this matters: Change often happens gradually. Noticing subtle shifts helps recognize progress that might otherwise be invisible.*

Consider:
- What's different now compared to before?
- What new conversations are happening?
- Where are relationships or dynamics evolving?
- What possibilities are opening (or closing)?

## Questions and Wonderings

*Why this matters: Good reflection often generates new questions. These guide continued learning and exploration.*

Consider:
- What are you more curious about now?
- What questions feel important to explore next?
- Where do you need more information or perspective?
- What are you wondering about but haven't asked yet?

## What This Means Going Forward

*Why this matters: Connecting reflection to future action ensures learning translates into evolved practice.*

Consider:
- How might this learning influence what happens next?
- What do you want to remember for the future?
- What support or resources are needed now?
- Who else should know about these insights?

*Remember: Reflection is a practice, not a performance. The goal isn't to have profound insights every time but to build a habit of noticing and learning. Even simple observations can reveal important patterns over time.*
