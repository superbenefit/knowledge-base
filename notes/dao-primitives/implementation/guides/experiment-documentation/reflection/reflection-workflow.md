# Experiment Reflection Documentation Workflow

This workflow guides the sequential use of reflection documentation tools to create comprehensive reflection documentation from experimental experience.

## Document Sequence

1. **Specification** → Defines what complete reflection documentation should contain
2. **Worksheet** → Progressive tool for gathering reflection information
3. **Template** → Structure for organizing worksheet insights into final documentation
4. **Quality Review** → Check final documentation against specification requirements

## Step 1: Review Specification Requirements
Read through [reflection-specification.md](notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/experiment-documentation/reflection/reflection-specification.md) to understand quality standards and required elements.

## Step 2: Progressive Information Gathering Using Worksheet
Complete [reflection-worksheet.md](notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/experiment-documentation/reflection/reflection-worksheet.md) sections progressively as insights develop.

## Step 3: AI-Assisted Template Development
Use AI prompts to synthesize worksheet content into [reflection-template.md](notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/experiment-documentation/reflection/reflection-template.md) sections.

**Example AI Prompt:**
```
Please create an executive summary for my reflection documentation using my worksheet insights.

Relevant worksheet sections: [paste sections 1, 2, 5 - Context, Outcomes, Learning]
Supporting context: [paste relevant Discovery Report sections]

Create an executive summary (2-3 paragraphs) that identifies the most important insights and key learning themes.
```

## Step 4: Quality Review Against Specification
Use AI prompts to identify gaps, assess quality, and enhance documentation against specification requirements.
