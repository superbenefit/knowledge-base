# Reflection Phase

## Purpose
The Reflection phase captures learning from whatever you try. It creates documentation that transforms experience into wisdom, helping you adapt approaches and contributing insights others can learn from. Reflection can happen multiple times - after key events, at natural pauses, or when something surprising occurs.

## Information Flow

### What You Reference from Earlier
- **Original challenges** from Discovery - Your baseline for noticing change
- **Chosen pathways** from Intervention - What you actually tried
- **Success criteria** - How you planned to evaluate effectiveness
- **Risk assessments** - What you prepared for versus what happened
- **Stakeholder expectations** - How different groups hoped things would go

### What You Capture Here
- **What actually happened** - Events, activities, and participation
- **Surprises and discoveries** - What you didn't expect or plan for
- **Multiple perspectives** - How different people experienced the same events
- **Emotional dimensions** - Joy, frustration, energy, resistance
- **Learning and insights** - What you now understand differently
- **Shifts and changes** - Evidence of movement or transformation

### How It's Used Later
- **Adaptation** → Insights inform how you adjust current approaches
- **Evidence** → Outcomes provide data for your case study
- **Patterns** → Recurring themes reveal transferable insights
- **Stories** → Experiences bring the work to life for others
- **Wisdom** → Learning guides future experiments

### What You Create
**Reflection Documents** - Honest accounts of learning from experience. These can be quick captures after significant moments or deeper retrospectives at major milestones. Multiple reflections build richer understanding over time.

## Process Overview
1. **Create space for reflection** - Step back from doing to notice learning
2. **Gather multiple voices** - Include different perspectives on what happened
3. **Look for patterns** - Notice what keeps showing up across experiences
4. **Extract insights** - Transform observations into transferable learning

## Available Tools
- `reflection.md` - Overview and principles for meaningful reflection
- `reflection-worksheet.md` - Questions to surface insights
- `reflection-template.md` - Structure for reflection documents
- `reflection-workflow.md` - AI prompts for learning synthesis

## Getting Started
Reflection works best when insights are fresh. Use the worksheet whenever something significant happens - you don't need to wait for formal milestones. Quick captures build into rich understanding. The workflow helps you transform raw observations into learning that serves both immediate adaptation and long-term wisdom.
