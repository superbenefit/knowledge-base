# Tools Guide for Experiment Documentation

## Overview

This guide presents optional tools and platforms that can support your experiment documentation journey. The framework itself is tool-agnostic - excellent documentation can be achieved with simple text files or sophisticated platforms. Choose tools that match your context, resources, and team capabilities.

## Selection Criteria

When choosing documentation tools, consider:

1. **Accessibility**: Can all stakeholders access and contribute?
2. **Sustainability**: Will the tool be available throughout your experiment?
3. **Flexibility**: Can it adapt to your evolving needs?
4. **Collaboration**: Does it support your team's working style?
5. **Export Options**: Can you extract your data if needed?
6. **Cost**: Does it fit your budget constraints?

- **System Mapping**: Whiteboards, diagramming tools
- **Synthesis**: AI assistants, text editors

### Intervention Phase
- **Strategy Documentation**: Collaborative documents
- **Pattern Research**: Web browsers, reference managers
- **Planning Tools**: Spreadsheets, project templates

### Reflection Phase
- **Data Collection**: Surveys, interview tools
- **Analysis**: Spreadsheets, coding tools
- **Documentation**: Templates, writing tools

### Synthesis Phase
- **Cross-phase Analysis**: Knowledge management tools
- **Narrative Development**: Writing platforms
- **Visual Creation**: Design tools

## Privacy and Security Considerations

- Assess data sensitivity before tool selection
- Consider local vs. cloud storage trade-offs
- Understand tool privacy policies
- Plan for data export and backup
- Consider stakeholder comfort with tools

## Getting Started Recommendations

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with tools you know
2. **Test with Team**: Ensure everyone can participate
3. **Document Tool Decisions**: Record why you chose specific tools
4. **Plan for Evolution**: Your needs may change over time
5. **Maintain Backups**: Protect your documentation investment

## Remember

The best tool is the one that:
- Your team will actually use
- Fits your context and constraints
- Allows you to focus on documentation, not tool management
- Can grow with your needs

Tools should serve your documentation process, not drive it. The framework's value comes from systematic thinking and progressive knowledge building, not from any particular platform or application.
