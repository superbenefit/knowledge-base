## Customization Notes

This template is a starting point. As you customize it:

1. **Delete sections** that don't apply to your context
2. **Add sections** for unique requirements
3. **Adjust timelines** to match your reality
4. **Modify language** to fit your organization's style
5. **Scale complexity** up or down as needed

Remember: The plan should serve your documentation process, not constrain it. Adapt freely as you learn what works best for your experiment.
