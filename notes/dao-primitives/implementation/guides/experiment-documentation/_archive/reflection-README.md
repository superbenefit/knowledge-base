# Reflection Phase

## Purpose
The Reflection phase captures learning from implementation activities, creating documentation that informs adaptation and contributes to final synthesis.

## Information Flow
**What you reference from earlier phases:**
- Original challenges from Discovery
- Chosen pathways from Intervention Map
- Success criteria and expectations
- Risk assessments and mitigation plans

**What you capture here:**
- What actually happened vs. plans
- Unexpected outcomes and surprises
- Stakeholder experiences and feedback
- Lessons learned and insights

**How it's used later:**
- Informs intervention adjustments
- Provides evidence for case study
- Contributes patterns to synthesis
- Guides future experiments

**Final output:** Reflection documents that capture learning at multiple points

## Process Overview
1. Use worksheet to capture insights as they emerge
2. Reference original plans and expectations
3. Document both successes and challenges
4. Create reflection documents at natural pause points

## Documents
- `reflection-worksheet.md` - Learning capture guide
- `reflection-template.md` - Document structure
- `reflection-workflow.md` - Synthesis process

## Getting Started
Reflection can happen at any scale - after events, at milestones, or when surprises occur. The worksheet helps capture insights while they're fresh. Multiple reflections build cumulative learning.
