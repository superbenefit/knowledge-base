# Intervention Phase

## Purpose
The Intervention phase transforms Discovery insights into strategic documentation of possible approaches, creating an actionable map for organizational change.

- Stakeholder analysis informs engagement strategies
- Organizational context shapes feasibility assessment
- Interest areas guide pathway development

**What you create here:**

- Risk assessments and mitigation strategies
- Success criteria for later evaluation

**How it's used later:**
- Pathways guide implementation activities
- Success criteria become reflection benchmarks
- Resource plans inform project management
- Risk assessments prepare for challenges

**Final output:** Intervention Map that guides action and sets evaluation framework
