# Discovery Phase

## Purpose
The Discovery phase creates foundational documentation about organizational context, challenges, and interests that informs all subsequent phases.

## Information Flow
**What you gather here:**
- Organizational structure and culture
- Current challenges and pain points
- Stakeholder perspectives
- Areas of curiosity for exploration

**How it's used later:**
- Challenges identified → become intervention focus areas
- Stakeholder mapping → guides engagement strategies
- Organizational context → shapes intervention feasibility
- Interest areas → inform pathway selection

**Final output:** Discovery Report that serves as reference throughout the experiment
