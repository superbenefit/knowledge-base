# Case Study Synthesis Workflow

## Overview

This workflow guides you through transforming documentation from Discovery, Intervention, and Reflection phases into compelling case studies. The process preserves the richness of each phase while weaving them into coherent narratives that serve multiple stakeholders and contribute to collective knowledge.

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Information Overload
**Solution**: Use worksheet to systematically extract only essential elements. Focus on story first, details second.

### Challenge: Multiple Perspectives Conflict
**Solution**: Acknowledge different views explicitly. Show how perspectives evolved through journey.

### Challenge: Balancing Success and Struggle
**Solution**: Frame challenges as learning opportunities. Show how struggles led to innovation.

### Challenge: Technical Complexity
**Solution**: Use analogies and plain language. Move technical details to appendices if needed.

### Challenge: Maintaining Authenticity
**Solution**: Use direct quotes extensively. Let stakeholders tell their own stories.

## Output Standards

### Document Characteristics
- **Length**: 4,000-6,000 words (10-15 pages)
- **Tone**: Engaging yet professional
- **Structure**: Clear navigation with descriptive headers
- **Evidence**: All claims supported with specifics
- **Visuals**: 4-5 diagrams/charts enhancing understanding

### Quality Indicators
✅ Reads as cohesive narrative, not compilation  
✅ Multiple voices woven throughout naturally  
✅ Evidence supports claims without overwhelming  
✅ Technical concepts accessible to lay readers  
✅ Patterns clearly documented and assessed  
✅ Value evident for all stakeholder groups  
✅ Contributes to broader knowledge commons  
✅ Inspires and informs future experiments  

## Post-Synthesis Activities

1. **Stakeholder Review**: Share with key participants for validation
2. **Pattern Library Update**: Submit pattern documentation
3. **Knowledge Base Integration**: Add metadata and cross-references
4. **Distribution Planning**: Prepare versions for different audiences
5. **Learning Application**: Use insights for future experiments

Remember: Great case studies tell human stories of transformation while providing practical knowledge for others on similar journeys. Balance rigor with readability, evidence with emotion, and specificity with broader applicability.
