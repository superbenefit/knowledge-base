# Synthesis Documentation

Pulling together insights from all phases into a case study that others can learn from.

## What Makes Good Synthesis Documentation

Great case studies tell a true story that matters. They weave together the threads from discovery, intervention, and reflection into a narrative that helps others see both the forest and the trees. The best syntheses feel complete without being exhausting, honest without being discouraging, and insightful without being preachy. They serve multiple audiences - funders see impact, practitioners find guidance, communities recognize their voice, and the knowledge commons gains wisdom.

## Common Patterns in Effective Synthesis

The strongest case studies maintain narrative tension - they don't reveal all outcomes upfront but let the story unfold naturally. They balance big-picture transformation with specific moments that bring change to life. They include enough context for outsiders to understand while moving quickly to what matters most.

Effective syntheses show change as it really happens - messy, non-linear, with setbacks and surprises. They resist the urge to smooth over complexity or present false certainty. They acknowledge multiple interpretations of events and show how different stakeholders experienced the same changes differently. Most importantly, they extract insights that travel - principles and patterns that others can adapt rather than rigid prescriptions to follow.

## Key Principles

- **Tell the real story** - Include complexity, setbacks, and surprises
- **Serve multiple audiences** - Balance different stakeholder needs
- **Extract transferable insights** - What can others learn and adapt?
- **Show the journey** - How you got there matters as much as where you ended up
