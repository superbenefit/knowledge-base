This template extends the base study template for documenting comprehensive experiments that span discovery, intervention, reflection, and synthesis phases. It creates rich case studies that serve multiple audiences while contributing to collective learning about organizational transformation.

**When to use this template vs. base study template:**
- Use BASE template for: Single tool/practice implementations, focused interventions, shorter engagements
- Use THIS template for: Multi-phase experiments, complex transformations, work spanning discovery through synthesis

**How this extends the base template:**
- Expands "Approach" section with pattern details and strategy
- Transforms "Transformation Story" into multi-phase narrative
- Enhances "Outcomes & Reflections" with deeper analysis
- Adds "Assessment & Evolution" for pattern documentation and future directions
- Includes richer frontmatter for experiment tracking

%%

---

## Approach

### From Discovery to Strategy

%% 
How did initial insights shape the strategic approach?
- Key findings from discovery that informed decisions
- How stakeholders were involved in planning
- Trade-offs and choices made
- Connection between understanding and action
%%

### Patterns and Interventions

%% 
Document the strategic choices:
- Which intervention areas were selected and why
- Specific patterns or approaches chosen for implementation
- How patterns were adapted for context
- Integration and sequencing decisions
%%

**Selected Patterns:**
- **[Pattern Name]**: [Brief description and rationale]

- **[Pattern Name]**: [Brief description and rationale]

### Resource Mobilization

%% 
Practical considerations:
- Human resources and capabilities assembled
- Technical infrastructure needs and solutions
- Financial resources and their sources
- Knowledge resources and external support
%%

---

## Transformation Story

%% 
Tell the story of how change actually unfolded. Use phases, turning points, or thematic threads to organize the narrative. Include real voices, specific moments, and honest complexity.
%%

### Phase 1: [Descriptive Name] 

%% 
Early implementation period:
- What happened and key activities
- How stakeholders experienced this phase
- Early challenges and how they were addressed
- Initial signs of change or resistance
- Include compelling participant quotes
%%

### Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]

%% 
Middle implementation period:
- How the work evolved from Phase 1
- Major developments or turning points
- Deeper understanding that emerged
- Pivots or adaptations made
- Include diverse stakeholder perspectives
%%

### Phase 3: [Descriptive Name]

%% 
Later implementation period:
- Maturation and consolidation of changes
- Evidence of sustainability emerging
- Unexpected developments
- Shift in ownership or leadership
- Include community voices
%%

---

## Outcomes and Reflections

### What Changed

%% 
Document both visible and measurable changes:
- Key metrics and quantitative shifts (before/after)
- Participation and engagement evolution
- Resource flows and efficiency improvements
- Relationship and power dynamics
- Cultural and capability transformations
- System-level changes

Use whatever evidence best tells the story - numbers, stories, quotes, comparisons.
%%

### What We Learned

%% 
Share insights and discoveries from the experience:
- What worked well and why
- Challenges navigated and solutions found
- Unexpected discoveries and innovations
- Patterns that emerged across the work
- Success factors others should know about

Focus on transferable insights rather than just describing what happened.
%%

### Critical Reflections

%% 
Honest assessment of the work:
- Where we fell short of aspirations
- Trade-offs and compromises made
- Questions that remain unanswered
- What we would do differently
- Tensions and contradictions faced

This transparency helps others learn from both successes and struggles.
%%

---

## Assessment & Evolution

### Pattern/Approach Performance

%% 
Evaluate how the chosen approaches worked in practice:
- Which patterns or approaches proved most effective
- Necessary adaptations for context

Include specific examples and evidence.
%%

### Sustainability and Continuation

%% 
What persists beyond the initial experiment:
- Changes that have become embedded
- Community ownership and leadership
- Institutional shifts that support continuation
- Resources or structures created
- Ongoing evolution of the work
%%

### Transferable Insights

%% 
What others can learn and apply:
- Core principles that transcend context
- Adaptation strategies for different settings
- Minimum viable conditions for success
