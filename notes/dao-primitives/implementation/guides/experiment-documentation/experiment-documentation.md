# Experiment Documentation Framework

A framework for capturing valuable knowledge from experiments and collaborative work without creating documentation burden.

## Phase Documentation
- **[[discovery/discovery|Discovery]]** - Understanding context and challenges
- **[[intervention/intervention|Intervention]]** - Exploring possible approaches
- **[[reflection/reflection|Reflection]]** - Capturing what was learned
- **[[synthesis/synthesis|Synthesis]]** - Creating case studies to share

## Start Here
Pick the phase that matches where you are right now - there's no required sequence. Each phase has a worksheet for gathering insights and a workflow for creating documentation.
