# Experiment Documentation Framework

*Main navigation hub for the progressive documentation system*

## Getting Started

**New to the framework?** Start here:
1. **[[readme|System Overview]]** - System overview and quick start guide
2. **[[framework-guide|Framework Guide]]** - Philosophy and approach explanation  
3. **[[discovery/discovery|Discovery Phase]]** - Begin with understanding context and challenges

## Framework Overview

### Core Documents
- **[[readme|README]]** - Primary entry point with system overview and information flow diagram
- **[[framework-guide|Framework Guide]]** - Detailed explanation of progressive documentation philosophy and best practices
- **[[information-flow|Information Flow]]** - How information moves between phases, decision points, and optimization strategies

### Phase Documentation

The framework provides documentation for four interconnected phases that typically flow sequentially while remaining flexible for iterative and parallel approaches.

#### Discovery - Understanding Context
**[[discovery/discovery|Discovery Overview]]** - Phase overview and navigation
- **[[discovery/discovery-specification|Discovery Specification]]** - Required elements and quality criteria for Discovery Reports
- **[[discovery/discovery-worksheet|Discovery Worksheet]]** - Information gathering tool for organizational context, challenges, and stakeholder analysis
- **[[discovery/discovery-template|Discovery Template]]** - Structure for final Discovery Report documentation
- **[[discovery/discovery-workflow|Discovery Workflow]]** - Process guidance for conducting Discovery work

#### Intervention - Mapping Possibilities
**[[intervention/intervention|Intervention Overview]]** - Phase overview and navigation
- **[[intervention/intervention-specification|Intervention Specification]]** - Required elements and quality criteria for Intervention Maps
- **[[intervention/intervention-worksheet|Intervention Worksheet]]** - Planning tool for intervention design and stakeholder readiness assessment
- **[[intervention/intervention-template|Intervention Template]]** - Structure for final Intervention Map documentation
- **[[intervention/intervention-workflow|Intervention Workflow]]** - Process guidance for intervention planning and design

#### Reflection - Capturing Learning
**[[reflection/reflection|Reflection Overview]]** - Phase overview and navigation
- **[[reflection/reflection-specification|Reflection Specification]]** - Required elements and quality criteria for Retrospectives
- **[[reflection/reflection-worksheet|Reflection Worksheet]]** - Learning capture tool for outcomes, challenges, and stakeholder feedback
- **[[reflection/reflection-template|Reflection Template]]** - Structure for Retrospective documentation (multiple uses)
- **[[reflection/reflection-workflow|Reflection Workflow]]** - Process guidance for reflection activities and learning capture

#### Synthesis - Creating Knowledge
**[[synthesis/synthesis|Synthesis Overview]]** - Phase overview and navigation
- **[[synthesis/synthesis-specification|Synthesis Specification]]** - Required elements and quality criteria for Case Studies
- **[[synthesis/synthesis-worksheet|Synthesis Worksheet]]** - Integration tool for identifying patterns and transferable insights
- **[[synthesis/synthesis-template|Synthesis Template]]** - Structure for comprehensive Case Study documentation
- **[[synthesis/synthesis-workflow|Synthesis Workflow]]** - Process guidance for synthesis work and knowledge commons contribution

### Supporting Resources

Available in the root directory for easy access:
- **[[progressive-documentation-principles|Progressive Documentation Principles]]** - Core concepts and theoretical foundations
- **[[tools-guide|Tools Guide]]** - Optional tools and platform recommendations (maintains tool agnosticism)
- **[[implementation-plan-template|Implementation Plan Template]]** - Customizable planning template for experiments

## Document Types Explained

### Folder Notes
Navigation hubs for each directory (discovery.md, intervention.md, etc.) that explain purpose, provide links to contents, and offer contextual guidance.

### Specifications (*-specification.md)
Define the "what" - required elements, quality criteria, and completeness standards for each phase's primary output. Ensure consistency while remaining flexible about methods.

### Worksheets (*-worksheet.md)  
Provide the "capture" - practical information gathering tools designed for progressive completion. Build on insights from previous phases and carry forward relevant information.

### Templates (*-template.md)
Offer the "structure" - document organization patterns that align with specifications and incorporate worksheet information. Include guidance comments and customization prompts.

### Workflows (*-workflow.md)
Guide the "how" - process instructions for moving through each phase effectively. Provide options for different engagement styles rather than rigid procedures.

## Quick Reference - Outputs by Phase

| Phase | Primary Output | Information Gathered | Builds Toward |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Discovery** | Discovery Report | Organizational context, challenges, stakeholder perspectives, system mapping | Intervention design possibilities |
| **Intervention** | Intervention Map | Intervention options, resource requirements, success criteria, implementation planning | Implementation and learning capture |
| **Reflection** | Retrospective(s) | Outcomes, lessons learned, stakeholder feedback, process insights | Pattern identification and synthesis |
| **Synthesis** | Case Study | Integrated insights, transferable patterns, knowledge commons contribution | Shared learning and future experiments |

## Phase Flow Patterns

While phases often flow sequentially (Discovery → Intervention → Reflection → Synthesis), the framework supports various patterns:

- **Sequential Flow**: Traditional progression through all phases
- **Iterative Cycles**: Multiple rounds of intervention and reflection
- **Parallel Tracks**: Simultaneous work on different phases
- **Adaptive Flow**: Phases activated as needed based on emerging insights

The framework maintains clear information connections regardless of flow pattern chosen.

## Navigation Patterns

### For Framework Users
- Start with core documents to understand approach
- Set up directory structure for your documentation
- Progress through phases based on your engagement's natural flow
- Use supporting resources as needed for additional guidance

### For Framework Contributors
- Review information flow documentation for system understanding
- Examine all document types to understand relationships
- Test user experience through the complete setup process
- Document improvements and adaptations for community benefit

### For Knowledge Seekers
- Browse completed case studies in synthesis folders
- Review patterns and insights in supporting resources
- Examine specific phase approaches that match your interests
- Contribute your own experiments to the knowledge commons

## Common Usage Scenarios

### Consultation Documentation
- Focus on Discovery and Intervention phases
- Use compressed templates for essential insights
- Create summary synthesis for knowledge sharing

### Project Documentation
- Complete all four phases with detailed documentation
- Multiple reflection cycles throughout engagement
- Comprehensive case study contributing to knowledge commons

### Partnership Documentation
- Iterative phases with continuous learning
- Regular synthesis contributions as insights develop
- Long-term relationship and knowledge building

*This framework succeeds when it enables better knowledge capture and sharing while remaining invisible enough not to constrain natural collaborative work. It should feel like a helpful structure that supports your engagement rather than an additional burden.*
