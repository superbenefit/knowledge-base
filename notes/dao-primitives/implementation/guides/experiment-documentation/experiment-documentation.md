# Experiment Documentation Framework

*Main navigation hub for the progressive documentation system*

## Getting Started

**New to the framework?** Start here:
1. **[[notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/experiment-documentation/readme]]** - System overview and quick start guide
2. **[[framework-guide.md]]** - Philosophy and approach explanation  
3. **[[notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/experiment-documentation/discovery/discovery]]** - Begin with understanding context and challenges

## Framework Overview

### Core Documents
- **[[notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/experiment-documentation/readme]]** - Primary entry point with system overview and information flow diagram
- **[[framework-guide.md]]** - Detailed explanation of progressive documentation philosophy and best practices
- **[[information-flow.md]]** - How information moves between phases, decision points, and optimization strategies

### Phase Documentation (Sequential Process)

The framework uses a numbered system to indicate the typical sequence of documentation phases, while remaining flexible for iterative and parallel approaches.

- **[[discovery-workflow]]** - Process guidance for conducting Discovery work

#### 02-intervention/ - Mapping Possibilities
**[[02-intervention/_intervention.md]]** - Phase overview and navigation
- **[[intervention-specification]]** - Required elements and quality criteria for Intervention Maps
- **[[intervention-worksheet]]** - Planning tool for intervention design and stakeholder readiness assessment
- **[[intervention-template]]** - Structure for final Intervention Map documentation
- **[[intervention-workflow]]** - Process guidance for intervention planning and design

#### 03-reflection/ - Capturing Learning
**[[03-reflection/_reflection.md]]** - Phase overview and navigation
- **[[03-reflection/reflection-specification.md]]** - Required elements and quality criteria for Retrospectives
- **[[03-reflection/reflection-worksheet.md]]** - Learning capture tool for outcomes, challenges, and stakeholder feedback
- **[[03-reflection/reflection-template.md]]** - Structure for Retrospective documentation (multiple uses)
- **[[03-reflection/reflection-workflow.md]]** - Process guidance for reflection activities and learning capture

#### 04-synthesis/ - Creating Knowledge
**[[notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/experiment-documentation/synthesis/synthesis]]** - Phase overview and navigation
- **[[synthesis-specification]]** - Required elements and quality criteria for Case Studies
- **[[synthesis-worksheet]]** - Integration tool for identifying patterns and transferable insights
- **[[synthesis-template]]** - Structure for comprehensive Case Study documentation
- **[[synthesis-workflow]]** - Process guidance for synthesis work and knowledge commons contribution

### Supporting Materials

#### 05-supporting-resources/ - Optional Tools and Guides
**[[z-resources]]** - Supporting materials overview and navigation
- **[[progressive-documentation-principles]]** - Core concepts and theoretical foundations
- **[[tools-guide]]** - Optional tools and platform recommendations (maintains tool agnosticism)
- **[[05-supporting-resources/examples/]]** - Anonymized examples and case study samples (when available)

#### 06-legacy/ - Archived Materials
- Contains previous versions and outdated documents maintained for reference
- **[[drafts/pdf-old/readme]]** - Explanation of archived materials and migration notes

## Document Types Explained

### Folder Notes (_*.md)
Navigation hubs for each directory that explain purpose, provide links to contents, and offer contextual guidance. The underscore prefix ensures they appear at the top of folder listings in most systems.

### Specifications (*-specification.md)
Define the "what" - required elements, quality criteria, and completeness standards for each phase's primary output. Ensure consistency while remaining flexible about methods.

### Worksheets (*-worksheet.md)  
Provide the "capture" - practical information gathering tools designed for progressive completion. Build on insights from previous phases and carry forward relevant information.

### Templates (*-template.md)
Offer the "structure" - document organization patterns that align with specifications and incorporate worksheet information. Include guidance comments and customization prompts.

### Workflows (*-workflow.md)
Guide the "how" - process instructions for moving through each phase effectively. Provide options for different engagement styles rather than rigid procedures.

## Quick Reference - Outputs by Phase

| Phase | Primary Output | Information Gathered | Builds Toward |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Discovery** | Discovery Report | Organizational context, challenges, stakeholder perspectives, system mapping | Intervention design possibilities |
| **Intervention** | Intervention Map | Intervention options, resource requirements, success criteria, implementation planning | Implementation and learning capture |
| **Reflection** | Retrospective(s) | Outcomes, lessons learned, stakeholder feedback, process insights | Pattern identification and synthesis |
| **Synthesis** | Case Study | Integrated insights, transferable patterns, knowledge commons contribution | Shared learning and future experiments |

## Folder Numbering System

The numbered prefixes (01-, 02-, 03-, 04-) indicate the typical sequence for documentation phases:

- **01-discovery** - Usually first, establishing context and understanding
- **02-intervention** - Builds on Discovery insights to map possibilities  
- **03-reflection** - Captures learning from intervention attempts and process
- **04-synthesis** - Integrates insights from all phases into transferable knowledge

**Important:** This numbering represents a common flow pattern, not a rigid requirement. Phases can overlap, iterate, or run in parallel based on engagement needs. The framework supports various flow patterns while maintaining clear information connections.

## Navigation Patterns

### For Framework Users
- Start with core documents to understand approach
- Set up directory structure for your documentation
- Progress through phases based on your engagement's natural flow
- Use supporting resources as needed for additional guidance

### For Framework Contributors
- Review information flow documentation for system understanding
- Examine all document types to understand relationships
- Test user experience through the complete setup process
- Document improvements and adaptations for community benefit

### For Knowledge Seekers
- Browse completed case studies in synthesis folders
- Review patterns and insights in supporting resources
- Examine specific phase approaches that match your interests
- Contribute your own experiments to the knowledge commons



## Common Usage Scenarios

### Consultation Documentation
- Focus on Discovery and Intervention phases
- Use compressed templates for essential insights
- Create summary synthesis for knowledge sharing

### Project Documentation
- Complete all four phases with detailed documentation
- Multiple reflection cycles throughout engagement
- Comprehensive case study contributing to knowledge commons

### Partnership Documentation
- Iterative phases with continuous learning
- Regular synthesis contributions as insights develop
- Long-term relationship and knowledge building

*This framework succeeds when it enables better knowledge capture and sharing while remaining invisible enough not to constrain natural collaborative work. It should feel like a helpful structure that supports your engagement rather than an additional burden.*
