# Experiment Documentation Framework

A collection of tools for capturing insights from organizational experiments and collaborative work. Each phase offers questions and templates that help transform lived experience into shareable wisdom.

## Phases
- [[discovery/discovery|Discovery]] - Understanding context and challenges
- [[intervention/intervention|Intervention]] - Exploring possible approaches
- [[reflection/reflection|Reflection]] - Capturing what was learned
- [[synthesis/synthesis|Synthesis]] - Creating case studies to share

## Where to Start
Jump into whichever phase matches where you are right now. If you're just beginning to understand a situation, try Discovery. If you're in the middle of trying something new, Reflection might help capture insights as they emerge.
