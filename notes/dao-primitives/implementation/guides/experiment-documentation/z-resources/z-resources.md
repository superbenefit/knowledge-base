# Supporting Resources

## Purpose

This folder contains optional resources that enhance the use of the Experiment Documentation Framework without prescribing specific methods or approaches. These materials support users in adapting the framework to their unique contexts while maintaining quality documentation standards.

## Available Resources

### [Progressive Documentation Principles](progressive-documentation-principles.md)
Theoretical foundations and core concepts underlying the framework's design. Explains how progressive documentation reduces duplication, builds knowledge systematically, and maintains flexibility across diverse experimental contexts.

### [Tools Guide](tools-guide.md)
Optional tools and platforms that can support documentation activities. Remains platform-agnostic while providing selection criteria for different contexts. Includes both digital and analog options.

### [Implementation Plan Template](implementation-plan-template.md)
Customizable template for creating project-specific implementation plans. Helps users adapt the framework to their timeline, stakeholders, and objectives while maintaining progressive documentation principles.

### Examples (Coming Soon)
Anonymized examples from completed experiments demonstrating how the framework works in practice. Will include diverse organizational contexts and experimental approaches.

## Using Supporting Resources

These resources are entirely optional and should be used only when they add value to your documentation process. The core framework (Phases 1-4) provides everything needed for comprehensive experiment documentation.

**When to Use These Resources**:
- **Principles**: When you need deeper understanding of why the framework works as it does
- **Tools Guide**: When selecting platforms or tools for your documentation process
- **Implementation Plan**: When coordinating complex experiments with multiple stakeholders
- **Examples**: When seeking inspiration or validation for your approach

**Key Reminders**:
- The framework remains method-agnostic - these resources support but don't prescribe
- Choose only what serves your specific context
- Adapt freely while maintaining progressive documentation principles
- Quality documentation can be achieved with simple tools

## Contributing Resources

As the framework evolves through use, new supporting resources may be added based on community needs and learnings. Contributions that maintain the framework's flexibility and accessibility are welcome.

Potential future additions:
- Visual documentation templates
- Stakeholder engagement strategies
- Pattern matching guides
- Quality review checklists

## Relationship to Core Framework

Supporting resources enhance but never replace the core four-phase documentation process:

1. **Discovery** → Understanding context and challenges
2. **Intervention** → Documenting strategic approaches
3. **Reflection** → Capturing learnings and impacts
4. **Synthesis** → Creating comprehensive case studies

These resources help you implement the phases more effectively while respecting your existing organizational processes and approaches.
