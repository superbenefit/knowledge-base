# Intervention Documentation Workflow

This workflow guides you through using the Intervention phase documents to create a comprehensive Intervention Map.

## Understanding the Value

The Intervention Map transforms Discovery insights into strategic possibilities for organizational change. It documents multiple pathways forward, helping organizations understand their options and make informed decisions. This workflow shows how to systematically develop intervention documentation using the framework tools.

## Document Sequence

1. **Review readme.md** → Understand intervention documentation purpose
2. **Reference Discovery Report** → Ground interventions in identified challenges
3. **Use intervention-worksheet.md** → Explore possibilities systematically
4. **Apply intervention-template.md** → Structure strategic options
5. **AI-assisted synthesis** → Transform explorations into clear pathways
6. **Quality review** → Ensure strategic coherence

## Step 1: Review Requirements

Start by reading the Intervention phase readme.md to understand:
- How Discovery findings inform intervention design
- What elements make effective intervention documentation
- How this information guides implementation
- Expected deliverables

## Step 2: Ground in Discovery

Before using the worksheet:
- Review your Discovery Report
- Identify key challenges to address
- Note stakeholder interests and concerns
- Understand organizational readiness

## Step 3: Strategic Exploration with Worksheet

Use intervention-worksheet.md to systematically explore possibilities:
- Connect each exploration to Discovery findings
- Document multiple pathway options
- Assess resources realistically
- Consider stakeholder implications
- Note success indicators

Work through all worksheet sections to ensure comprehensive exploration of strategic options.

## Step 4: AI-Assisted Synthesis

Transform worksheet content into structured documentation using these prompts:

### Executive Summary
```
Create an executive summary for the Intervention Map:

Discovery connections: [paste key challenges being addressed]
Intervention areas: [paste from worksheet section 2]
Strategic approach: [paste from worksheet section 7]
Resource considerations: [paste from worksheet section 3]

Write 200-300 words that convey strategic possibilities while acknowledging constraints.
```

### Strategic Context
```
Develop the strategic context section:

Discovery insights addressed: [paste from worksheet section 1]
Organizational readiness: [paste from worksheet section 3]
External factors: [paste relevant context]

Create narrative showing why these interventions make sense given the Discovery findings.
```

### Intervention Areas
```
For each intervention area, create comprehensive documentation:

Area: [paste from worksheet section 2]
Challenge addressed: [paste connection to Discovery]
Power dynamics: [paste from worksheet section 4]
Resources needed: [paste from worksheet section 3]

Present as a clear strategic option with rationale and requirements.
```

### Implementation Pathways
```
Transform pathway explorations into structured options:

Pathway name: [paste from worksheet section 7]
Approach: [paste description]
Activities: [paste key steps]
Resources: [paste requirements]
Risks: [paste from worksheet section 5]

Create clear description helping readers understand this as a genuine strategic choice.
```

### Success Framework
```
Develop success criteria from worksheet content:

Success indicators: [paste from worksheet section 6]
Evidence to track: [paste measurement ideas]

Create framework with both quantitative and qualitative indicators.
```

### Stakeholder Engagement Plan
```
Create stakeholder section from worksheet notes:

Stakeholder considerations: [paste from worksheet section 4]
Engagement approaches: [paste from worksheet section 8]

Develop plan showing how different groups would be involved and affected.
```

### Next Steps
```
Transform next steps into actionable documentation:

Immediate actions: [paste from worksheet section 8]
Decision points: [paste key choices]

Create specific, measurable next steps with clear ownership.
```

## Step 5: Template Population

With synthesized content:
1. Open intervention-template.md
2. Paste content into appropriate sections
3. Ensure connections to Discovery are explicit
4. Add transitions for flow
5. Review for strategic coherence

## Step 6: Quality Review

Enhance your Intervention Map using these prompts:

### Strategic Alignment Check
```
Review this Intervention Map for strategic coherence:

[Paste document]

Assess whether:
- Each intervention clearly addresses Discovery findings
- Pathways represent genuinely different approaches
- Resource assessments are realistic
- Success criteria align with interventions

Suggest improvements for strategic clarity.
```

### Completeness Review
```
Check this Intervention Map against requirements:

[Paste document]

Verify:
- All template sections completed
- Multiple pathways documented
- Resources clearly assessed
- Risks acknowledged
- Next steps actionable

Identify gaps or weak sections.
```

### Stakeholder Perspective Review
```
Review from different stakeholder viewpoints:

[Paste document or section]

For each stakeholder group, check:
- Benefits clearly articulated
- Concerns addressed
- Involvement explained
- Impact understood

Suggest improvements for stakeholder clarity.
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Too many intervention possibilities
**Solution**: Use impact/effort analysis to prioritize 2-4 key areas

**Issue**: Vague resource estimates
**Solution**: Provide ranges; separate essential from optional resources

**Issue**: Weak Discovery connections
**Solution**: Explicitly reference Discovery findings for each intervention

**Issue**: Overly technical language
**Solution**: Use AI to simplify while maintaining precision

## Deliverable: Intervention Map

Your completed Intervention Map should:
- Present multiple strategic pathways
- Connect clearly to Discovery findings
- Include realistic resource assessments
- Define success criteria
- Provide actionable next steps

The document typically runs 8-12 pages, presenting options clearly for organizational decision-making.
