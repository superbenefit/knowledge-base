# Intervention Phase Documentation

## Purpose

The Intervention phase transforms insights from Discovery into strategic documentation of potential system changes. This phase captures how organizations might employ decentralized coordination patterns to address identified challenges, documenting decision-making processes and strategic choices without prescribing specific methodologies.

## Phase Outcomes

**Primary Output**: Intervention Mapping Document
- Strategic documentation of intervention possibilities
- Pattern connections to decentralized approaches
- Resource and stakeholder considerations
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Success criteria and evaluation frameworks

**Value for Multiple Stakeholders**:
- **Organizations**: Clear documentation of strategic options and pathways
- **Facilitators**: Structured approach to intervention planning
- **Knowledge Commons**: Reusable patterns and adaptation strategies

## Documents in This Phase

### [Intervention Specification](intervention-specification.md)
Defines the required elements and quality criteria for intervention mapping documents. Establishes what constitutes a complete and useful intervention strategy documentation.

### [Intervention Worksheet](intervention-worksheet.md)
Progressive tool for gathering strategic information about potential interventions. Builds directly on Discovery findings to identify opportunities, assess resources, and document decisions.

### [Intervention Template](intervention-template.md)
Structured format for organizing intervention mapping content. Provides consistent sections for documenting strategies, pathways, and implementation considerations.

### [Intervention Workflow](intervention-workflow.md)
Process guidance for moving from Discovery insights to intervention documentation. Includes AI-assisted synthesis prompts and flexible approaches for different contexts.

## Relationship to Other Phases

**Building on Discovery**:
- Uses systemic issues identified in Discovery as starting points
- References stakeholder analysis and organizational context
- Connects challenges to potential intervention areas

**Preparing for Reflection**:
- Documents strategic decisions for later evaluation
- Establishes success criteria for reflection activities
- Creates baseline for measuring change

**Contributing to Synthesis**:
- Provides strategic context for case study development
- Documents pattern selection and adaptation rationale
- Captures decision-making processes for learning

## Key Principles

1. **Method-Agnostic Documentation**: Captures strategic thinking without prescribing specific intervention approaches
2. **Pattern-Oriented Thinking**: Connects challenges to decentralized coordination patterns
3. **Multi-Stakeholder Perspective**: Documents considerations for all affected parties
4. **Resource Realism**: Honest assessment of capabilities and constraints
5. **Progressive Building**: Directly references and builds on Discovery findings

## Common Intervention Patterns

While each organization's context is unique, common areas for intervention documentation include:

- **Governance and Decision-Making**: How power and authority might be redistributed
- **Information and Knowledge Flows**: Systems for enhanced collective intelligence
- **Resource Coordination**: Mechanisms for more effective resource allocation
- **Community Engagement**: Approaches to meaningful participation
- **Technology Integration**: Strategic use of decentralized tools

## Getting Started

1. Review your completed Discovery Report
2. Use the Intervention Worksheet to explore possibilities
3. Reference the Specification for completeness
4. Follow the Workflow for synthesis guidance
5. Organize findings using the Template

Remember: This phase documents strategic possibilities, not prescriptive solutions. The goal is to capture thoughtful analysis of how decentralized patterns might address identified challenges while respecting organizational context and constraints.
