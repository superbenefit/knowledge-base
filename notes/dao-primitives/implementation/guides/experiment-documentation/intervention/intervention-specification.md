# Intervention Mapping Specification

## Overview

An Intervention Mapping document strategically connects Discovery insights to potential system transformations using decentralized coordination patterns. This specification defines the required elements and quality criteria for comprehensive intervention documentation.

## Required Elements

### 1. Executive Summary (200-300 words)
- Brief overview of strategic intervention approach
- Connection to key Discovery findings
- Primary intervention areas identified
- High-level resource and timeline considerations

### 2. Strategic Context
- **Discovery Connections**: Direct references to systemic issues from Discovery Report
- **Organizational Readiness**: Assessment based on Discovery findings
- **Environmental Factors**: External considerations affecting intervention possibilities
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Summary of stakeholder interests and concerns

### 3. Intervention Areas (2-4 areas)

For each intervention area, document:

**Problem-Solution Mapping**:
- Specific systemic issue being addressed (from Discovery)
- How the issue currently impacts the organization
- Potential for positive change through intervention

**Power Dynamics Analysis**:
- Current distribution of decision-making authority
- Opportunities for redistribution of power
- Implications for different stakeholder groups

**Pattern Connections**:
- Relevant decentralized coordination patterns
- How patterns address the specific challenge
- Examples from other contexts (if available)

### 4. Implementation Pathways (2-3 pathways)

For each pathway, include:

**Pathway Description**:
- Overall approach and philosophy
- Key activities or phases
- Stakeholder involvement strategy

**Resource Analysis**:
- Human resources needed (roles, skills, time)
- Technical resources (tools, platforms, infrastructure)
- Financial resources (budget estimates, funding sources)
- Knowledge resources (training, documentation, support)

**Risk Assessment**:
- Technical risks and mitigation strategies
- Social/cultural risks and approaches
- Resource risks and contingencies
- External risks and responses

### 5. Pattern Application Strategy

**Pattern Selection Rationale**:
- Why specific patterns were chosen
- How patterns align with organizational culture
- Adaptation requirements for context

**Integration Approach**:
- How patterns work together
- Sequencing and dependencies
- Technical and social integration points

### 6. Success Framework

**Success Criteria**:
- Quantitative metrics (specific, measurable)
- Qualitative indicators (observable changes)
- Timeline for achievement
- Evaluation methods

**Monitoring Approach**:
- How progress will be tracked
- Feedback mechanisms
- Adaptation processes

### 7. Stakeholder Considerations

**Stakeholder Impact Analysis**:
- How each group is affected by interventions
- Benefits and challenges for each group
- Support and resistance factors

**Engagement Strategy**:
- Communication approaches
- Participation mechanisms
- Capacity building needs

### 8. Next Steps and Decision Points

**Immediate Actions**:
- First steps to begin implementation
- Quick wins or pilot opportunities
- Preparation requirements

**Key Decisions**:
- Critical choices requiring stakeholder input
- Timeline for decisions
- Decision-making processes

## Quality Criteria

### Completeness
- ✓ All required sections present and substantive
- ✓ Clear connections to Discovery findings throughout
- ✓ Multiple perspectives considered
- ✓ Both opportunities and challenges addressed

### Clarity
- ✓ Strategic thinking is well-articulated
- ✓ Technical concepts explained accessibly
- ✓ Visual aids used where helpful
- ✓ Jargon minimized or defined

### Actionability
- ✓ Pathways are concrete enough to guide action
- ✓ Resources realistically assessed
- ✓ Next steps are clear and achievable
- ✓ Success criteria are measurable

### Flexibility
- ✓ Multiple pathways provided
- ✓ Adaptation points identified
- ✓ Contingencies considered
- ✓ Learning mechanisms built in

## Length and Format Guidelines

**Target Length**: 3,000-5,000 words (8-12 pages)

**Essential Components**:
- Executive summary for quick understanding
- Visual diagrams for complex relationships
- Clear headers and navigation
- Consistent terminology from Discovery

**Optional Enhancements**:
- Appendices with detailed analysis
- Case study references
- Technical specifications
- Budget breakdowns

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Prescriptive Solutions**: Document possibilities, not mandates
2. **Technical Solutionism**: Balance technical and social considerations
3. **Stakeholder Blindness**: Include all affected groups
4. **Resource Optimism**: Be realistic about constraints
5. **Pattern Forcing**: Only use patterns that genuinely fit

## Connection to Other Phases

**From Discovery**:
- Every intervention area must link to Discovery findings
- Stakeholder analysis informs engagement strategies
- Organizational context shapes pathway selection

**To Reflection**:
- Success criteria become reflection benchmarks
- Risk assessments guide monitoring focus
- Stakeholder considerations shape feedback collection

**To Synthesis**:
- Strategic rationale provides case study context
- Pattern selections contribute to knowledge commons
- Decision documentation enables learning extraction
