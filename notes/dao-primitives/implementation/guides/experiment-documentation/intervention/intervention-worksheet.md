# Intervention Exploration Guide

This guide helps you explore possible approaches to address the challenges and opportunities discovered. Think of it as a space for imagining "what if" rather than creating a fixed plan. Capture possibilities in whatever format helps you think creatively.

## Connecting to Discovery

*Why this matters: Grounding interventions in real challenges and genuine curiosity ensures efforts address what actually matters to people.*

Consider:
- Which challenges from Discovery feel most ready for change?
- Where did people express the most curiosity or energy?
- What patterns or leverage points emerged that suggest intervention opportunities?
- How do stakeholder interests align around certain issues?

## Exploring Possible Approaches

*Why this matters: Having multiple pathways to consider helps organizations choose what fits their culture and capacity rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all solution.*

For each possibility, consider:
- What would this approach look like in practice?
- How might it address the identified challenges?
- What makes this exciting or concerning to different stakeholders?
- What would need to be true for this to work?

## Understanding Resources

*Why this matters: Being realistic about what's available - not just money but time, energy, and attention - helps design interventions that can actually happen.*

Consider exploring:
- What resources (broadly defined) are available?
- Where might resources come from that aren't obvious?
- What's the minimum needed to try something meaningful?
- How do different approaches vary in resource intensity?

## Power and Decision-Making

*Why this matters: Many interventions shift how decisions get made and who has influence. Being explicit about these shifts helps people understand what change really means.*

Consider:
- How might different approaches change who makes decisions?
- Where would authority or influence shift?
- What would be gained and what might feel like loss?
- How do various stakeholders feel about these shifts?

## Risks and Concerns

*Why this matters: Acknowledging what could go wrong isn't pessimistic - it's realistic planning that helps build trust and prepare for challenges.*

Consider exploring:
- What keeps people up at night about trying new approaches?
- Where might resistance or friction emerge?
- What could genuinely go wrong (vs. just fear)?
- How might different risks be addressed or mitigated?

## Success and Evidence

*Why this matters: Being clear about what success looks like helps everyone understand what you're working toward and know if you're making progress.*

Consider:
- What would be different if interventions succeed?
- How would various stakeholders experience success?
- What evidence would show progress is happening?
- What would be worth celebrating along the way?

## Pathways and Choices

*Why this matters: Organizations need real choices that reflect different values, resources, and appetite for change. Creating distinct pathways helps people see trade-offs clearly.*

Consider developing different pathways like:
- A "start small" approach for testing ideas
- A "go deep" approach for transformation
- A "broad engagement" approach for inclusion
- Or whatever framings emerge from your context

## Next Steps and Experiments

*Why this matters: Moving from ideas to action requires concrete next steps that feel doable and help test assumptions before bigger commitments.*

Consider:
- What small experiments could test key assumptions?
- Which stakeholders are ready to try something now?
- What would help build confidence for bigger steps?
- How will you learn from whatever happens next?

*Remember: The best interventions emerge from dialogue between possibilities and constraints. Use this guide to explore openly, then let realistic pathways emerge from what you learn.*
