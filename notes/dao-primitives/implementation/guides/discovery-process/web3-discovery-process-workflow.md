# Web3 Discovery Process Workflow

## Purpose

This Discovery Process Workflow supports the exploration of web3 technologies and decentralized governance approaches with partner organizations. It focuses on mapping current systems and identifying systemic issues as a foundation for potential experimentation.

## Objectives

The discovery process aims to produce a **discovery report** that covers:

1. Mapping the state of the current system
2. Identifying systemic issues in the current system

## Framing

This framework loosely follows the Estuarine Mapping process for systems change. There is an emphasis on beginning by mapping a granular understanding of the current state of the system, agreed upon by everyone participating in the mapping. From here the map of the current system can yield different aspects of the system that hold the potential for change and the level of cost/difficulty in changing them. From this point of clarity and agreement it is then relatively straight-forward to agree on what to do next.

> This approach assumes that systems (and solutions) will be in the realm of complexity, where experimentation and observation is needed to see how a system responds to change (emergent properties), rather than traditional approaches that assume that the results of an intervention can be predicted based solely on inputs to the system as in non-complex systems. Because we are working with concepts like network intelligence we have to assume that these systems are complex and act accordingly.

## Discovery Process Steps

### Phase 1: Preparation

1. **Identify Diverse Stakeholders**
   - Determine who needs to be included in the discovery process
   - Ensure diverse perspectives from across the system being mapped
   - Consider conducting preliminary research with stakeholders who cannot participate directly
   - Ideal group size is 6 or less for effective workshops

2. **Setup and Planning**
   - Prepare collaborative tools (e.g., shared whiteboarding tools like Figjam)
   - Create templates for system mapping
   - Schedule workshop sessions
   - Share background information with participants if needed

### Phase 2: System Mapping Workshop

**Map the state of the current system**

Gather stakeholders who want to participate in the design of the experiment into a workshop setting to work through the mapping process. This can be done in a single workshop with all stakeholders present.

In the workshop:

1. **Map the organizational systems that you want to explore**
   - Describe the particular systems using diagrams as starting points
   - Understand how capital/resources move through layers in the system
   - Trace how information moves between layers to inform decision-making
   - Note that the system you are mapping may not have the same structure as examples - aim to accurately map what the current system looks like

2. **Document Different System Layers**
   - Create separate maps for different systems, even within the same organization
   - Focus on understanding the different functions that each layer contributes
   - Ensure all participants agree on the accuracy of the maps

### Phase 3: Systemic Issues Identification

**Identify systemic issues in the current system**

The deeper the exploration into the issues in the system, the richer the opportunity space for intervention will become.

1. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Identify patterns in the current system that cause the system to produce poor outcomes
   - Specifically, explore where systems of power impede the system's ability to be collectively intelligent
   - Map the facets of the system that cause these issues to arise

2. **Systems Analysis**
   - Look to understand how these facets interact through the different layers
   - Explore why the system works this way
   - Identify what risks are being mitigated by the current composition of the system
   - Determine what forces are at work to keep the system in this state

3. **Power Dynamics Review**
   - Analyze how negative power dynamics might be the result of lack of network intelligence
   - Examine how systems of power have emerged as a consequence of attempts to safeguard against risks caused by insufficient information
   - Consider how information flows and systems of power might be redesigned together

### Phase 4: Areas of Interest Exploration

Building on the system mapping and issues identification, explore potential areas of interest:

1. **Collaborative Exploration Session**
   - Facilitate discussions around areas where web3 approaches might address identified issues
   - Use "How might we..." framing to explore possibilities
   - Document questions that emerge for further exploration

2. **Connect to Web3 Patterns**
   - Introduce relevant web3 patterns that might address systemic issues
   - Explore how specific web3 approaches could transform identified problem areas
   - Consider existing examples and case studies of similar applications

### Phase 5: Synthesis & Report Creation

**Discovery Report**

Produce a report that documents the discovery process, mapping of the current system and systemic issues that can be shared with stakeholders.

1. **Synthesize Findings**
   - Compile system maps and identified issues
   - Document areas of interest that emerged through discussions
   - Connect findings to relevant web3 patterns and communities

2. **Create Discovery Report**
   - Draft comprehensive report following the established template
   - Include visual representations of system maps
   - Ensure the report reflects the perspectives of all stakeholders

3. **Review & Refine**
   - Review draft with key participants for accuracy
   - Incorporate feedback and additional insights
   - Finalize report for sharing with broader stakeholder group

## Adapting the Process

This workflow can be adapted based on several factors:

**Process Depth**
- If much of the sense-making around issues in the system has already been done, the systemic issues identification can be relatively straightforward
- If approaching afresh, this step may benefit from a deeper sense-making process facilitation

**Time Constraints**
- For faster processes, system mapping and issues identification can be combined
- For thorough exploration, separate sessions for each major step may be beneficial

**Stakeholder Availability**
- When key stakeholders can't participate directly, consider alternatives for capturing their perspectives
- For distributed teams, adapt workshop formats for digital collaboration

The discovery process is complete when you have a clear understanding of the current system and its systemic issues, documented in a discovery report. This forms the foundation for identifying potential intervention areas and designing experiments in subsequent phases.
