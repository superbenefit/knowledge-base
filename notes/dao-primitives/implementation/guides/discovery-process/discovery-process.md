# Web3 Discovery Process: From Workflow to Report

This guide explains how to transform the outputs from your discovery workflow into a comprehensive discovery report. It provides section-by-section instructions for populating the report template based on activities conducted during the discovery process.

## Using This Guide

This document connects the activities you'll conduct during the discovery process (as outlined in the workflow) with the sections of the final report template. Use it to understand:

1. Which workflow activities generate content for specific report sections
2. How to structure and organize information for each section
3. How to ensure consistency between the process and documentation

## Section-by-Section Guide

External Pressures:

- Describe market or funding ecosystem challenges
- Note regulatory or compliance issues
- Document community or stakeholder tensions

Opportunity Areas:

- Highlight underutilized assets or capabilities
- List unmet needs that were identified
- Note potential leverage points for system change

### 5. Areas of Interest for Web3 Approaches

**From the Workflow:**

- Draw from Phase 4: Areas of Interest Exploration
- Use outputs from Collaborative Exploration Sessions
- Reference questions documented during workshops

**For the Report:**

- Identify 3-5 primary areas where the organization expressed interest
- For each area, include 3-5 "How might we..." questions that emerged
- Ensure questions connect to identified systemic issues

### 6. Connections to Web3 Patterns

**From the Workflow:**

- Use outputs from "Connect to Web3 Patterns" activities in Phase 4
- Draw from discussions about relevant web3 approaches
- Include patterns introduced during workshop discussions

**For the Report:**

- Document 2-4 web3 patterns relevant to the areas of interest
- For each pattern, provide an accessible explanation
- List common practices associated with each pattern
- Connect each pattern to specific organizational interests

### 7. Potential Paths for Exploration

**From the Workflow:**

- Draw from discussions in Phase 4 and synthesis in Phase 5
- Include paths that garnered interest during synthesis
- Reference patterns from "Connect to Web3 Patterns" activities

**For the Report:**

- Outline 2-4 potential approaches for further exploration
- For each path, provide implementation details
- Where possible, reference organizations with similar approaches
- Present options in order of accessibility/feasibility

### 8. Relevant Patterns Observed

**From the Workflow:**

- Use outputs from Pattern Identification in Phase 5
- Draw from synthesis discussions
- Include patterns that connect to identified systemic issues

**For the Report:**

- Document 2-3 specific patterns that align with the organization's context
- For each pattern, include:
    - A brief description
    - Its relevance to the organization
    - Examples of implementation elsewhere
    - Considerations for exploration

### 9. Next Steps in the Learning Journey

**From the Workflow:**

- Draw from Phase 5: Synthesis & Report Creation
- Include questions noted throughout the discovery process
- Reference potential paths identified during synthesis

**For the Report:**

Learning Opportunities:

- List specific resources relevant to areas of interest
- Include a mix of introductory and advanced materials
- Focus on practical, accessible starting points

Questions for Further Exploration:

- Document questions that emerged but weren't fully addressed
- Include questions that would benefit from deeper investigation
- Note areas where additional stakeholder input might be needed

Possible Collaborations:

- Suggest potential partnerships or community connections
- Include organizations working on similar challenges
- Note potential learning communities to join

### 10. Additional Resources

**From the Workflow:**

- Review notes from all discovery activities
- Include terms and concepts discussed during workshops
- Draw from facilitator knowledge of relevant resources

**For the Report:**

- Define key terms that arose during discussions
- List articles, books, or other resources related to areas of interest
- Suggest communities exploring similar questions

## Report Finalization Process

1. **Draft Review**
    
    - Share draft report with key participants
    - Gather feedback on accuracy and completeness
    - Make necessary adjustments
2. **Final Check**
    
    - Ensure all sections connect logically to one another
    - Verify that systemic issues and areas of interest are clearly linked
    - Confirm that next steps are appropriate to the organization's capacity
3. **Delivery**
    
    - Present the report to stakeholders
    - Walk through key findings and potential paths forward
    - Discuss immediate next steps based on the report

## Important Considerations

- **Balance between detail and readability:** Include enough detail to be useful without overwhelming readers with excessive information
- **Consistent voice:** Maintain a consistent, neutral tone throughout the report
- **Visual elements:** Include system maps and other visual artifacts where they add value
- **Direct quotes:** Use participants' own language where appropriate to maintain authenticity
- **Actionability:** Ensure next steps are concrete and feasible given organizational context
