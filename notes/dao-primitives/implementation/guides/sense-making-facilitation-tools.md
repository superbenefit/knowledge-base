## Causal Layered Analysis

**Name of tool:** Causal Layered Analysis

**Description:** A sense-making tool that walks a group through progressive layers of analysis to understand systems at increasing depth. The framework moves from surface-level symptoms to systemic causes, then to the worldview that underpins the system, and finally to the metaphors and myths (social narratives) that form the collective foundation for that worldview. The intent is to understand causation deeply enough to design change across multiple layers. The tool follows elements of Theory U methodology as it works through the system layers.

**Strengths and considerations:** This tool is valuable when you have a group willing to invest in deep exploration of systemic issues. The group and its supporting context must value this depth to justify the necessary time and resource investment. It requires participation from across the system being analyzed to build a comprehensive picture and design effective solutions.

## Estuarine Mapping

**Name of tool:** Estuarine Mapping

**Description:** A process developed by Dave Snowden designed for sense-making in complexity, related to the Cynefin framework. The framework guides groups through mapping the current state of a system by defining three different types of actors (actants) based on their ability to be changed (amount of energy and time required to change them). This mapping of current state and quantification of change possibilities allows groups to identify opportunities to intervene in parts of the system that could lead to emergent change in the system as a whole.

**Strengths and considerations:** This is a rigorously researched and tested system with documented effectiveness data. It has been primarily applied in larger organizations with traditional structures, so it doesn't require extensive buy-in to new ways of working that might be required by other modern sense-making practices. However, it may bypass some benefits that could be derived from more transformational group processes.

## Theory U

**Name of tool:** Theory U

**Description:** A sense-making methodology developed by Otto Scharmer to help groups develop solutions free from past patterns of thinking. The process moves through a "U" shaped journey: downloading, seeing, sensing, presencing, crystallizing, prototyping, and performing. It aims to transcend standard strategy processes that are limited by preconceived, habitual, and institutionalized ideas about solutions. Through deep group process and collective sense-making, the methodology seeks to unlock novel solutions that emerge from deeper understanding of underlying systems.

**Strengths and considerations:** This process originates from MIT research and has solid research foundations. It requires significant commitment of time and resources from participants and their supporting context to conduct necessary research and facilitated activities. Success depends on participants being genuinely committed to the process, making it challenging if buy-in is insufficient.

## Liberating Structures

**Name of tool:** Liberating Structures

**Description:** A collection of facilitation practices designed to help groups achieve specific goals. These structures are particularly effective at overcoming habitual and institutionalized group patterns that lead to poor outcomes. The library contains patterns that can be selected based on the particular needs of the group, with many ideally suited for various aspects of sense-making processes.

**Strengths and considerations:** Individual patterns can be implemented without lengthy training or extensive experience. They don't need to be part of a complete facilitation system and can be used in isolation to serve specific purposes as needed. This flexibility makes them accessible for facilitators with varying experience levels.

## The Value Flow Compass

**Name of tool:** Value Flow Compass

**Description:** Inspired by the business model canvas, this tool (currently in development) maps how value is produced, delivered, managed, and recovered across value-creating networks or organizations. It provides a business model framework for entities that don't fit typical business modeling structures, making it suitable for complex multi-stakeholder initiatives.

**Strengths and considerations:** The focus on mapping value flows allows use with web3-based models where value flows extend beyond simple monetary transactions. This creates flexibility for use with networks and non-traditional organizational structures that are common in decentralized systems.
