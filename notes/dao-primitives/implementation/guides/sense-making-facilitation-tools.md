This document is a work in progress. It contains tools and frameworks that can be used to facilitate sense-making processes. It is initially being created to as a resource for the RPP to develop facilitate the development of experiments but will form generic resource for sense-making tools that can be used in any sense-making context.

### Causal Layered Analysis

`Name of tool:` **Causal Layered Analysis**

`Description:` A sense-making tool that walks a group through a set of layers of analysis that dig deeper into the system in progressive steps. From a surface level of understanding, to the systemic causes, to the worldview that underpins the system, to the metaphors and myths (social narratives) for the collective foundation for the worldview. The intent is to understand causation in the system deep enough to be able to see design change across these multiple layers. The tool follows a version of [Theory U](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_U) as it works through the layers in the system.

`Strengths and considerations:` This tool is useful when you have a group who have the desire to go deep on an issue. The group (and its supporting context) must value this in order to put in the necessary time and resources into the process. It requires participation from across the system being analysed to build a true picture of it and be able to design solutions.

### Estuarine Mapping

`Name of tool:` **Estuarine Mapping**

`Description:` This is a process developed by Dave Snowden and is designed for sense-making in complexity and is related to the Cynefin framework. It walks a group through a process of mapping the current state of a system. It focuses on defining 3 different types of actants in the system which are mapped based on their ability to be changed (amount of energy & time required to change them). This mapping the current state and quantifying the possibility of changing aspects of the system allows a group to identify opportunities to experiment on parts of the system that could lead to emergent change in the system as a whole.

`Strengths and considerations:` This is is a rigorously researched and tested system with hard data on is effectiveness. It has been mostly applied in larger orgs with traditional structures and therefore does not require the same level of buy-in to new ways of working and relating that may be required by other modern sense-making practices. But also bypasses some of the benefits that might be derived from more "transformational" group processes.

### Theory U

`Name of tool:` Theory U

`Description:` This is a sense-making tool developed by Otto Scharmer. It used to help a group to develop solutions in way that is free from past patterns of thinking. It moves through a "U" process of downloading, seeing, sensing, presencing, crystallising, prototyping and performing. It aims to upend the standard strategy process that is limited by people's preconceived, habitual and institutionalised ideas about solutions design. By moving through a deep group process where collective sense-making can arrive at possible solutions to test the process hopes to unlock novel solutions that emerge from a deeper understanding of the underlying system.

`Strengths and considerations:` This process came out of MIT and has a good research underpinnings. It does require a commitment of time and resources from a group (and its enabling context) in order to do the necessary research and facilitated activities. It also requires people to commit to the process and is difficult if participants are not sufficiently bought-in to the process.

### Liberating Structures

`Name of tool:` Liberating structures

`Description:` Liberating structures are a set of practices to help groups to achieve particular goals. They are particularly good at overcoming habitual and institutionalised group patterns that lead to poor outcomes. There is a library of patterns that can be chosen from based on the particular need of the group. Many of which are ideally suited to aspects of sense-making

`Strengths and considerations:` The different patterns can be picked up and implemented without the need for lengthy training and experience. They don't have to be part of a complete facilitation system and just can be grabbed and used in isolation to serve a specific purpose as needed.

### The Value Flow Compass

`Name of tool:` Value Flow Compass

`Description:` Inspired by the business model canvas, the tool (which is still in development) can be used to map the ways that value is produced, delivered, managed and recovered across a particular value creating network or organization. Essentially a business model for something that does not fit into a typical business modelling structure.

`Strengths and considerations:` A focus on mapping value allows for use with more interesting web3 based models where value flows beyond simple money flows are important. This creates the flexibility to be used with networks and other non-typical organizational structures.
