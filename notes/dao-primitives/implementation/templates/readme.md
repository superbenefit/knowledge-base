# Case Study Development Templates

This directory contains templates for the three-stage case study development process. Each template provides structured formats for documenting different phases of web3 intervention development, from initial discovery through implementation outcomes.

## Template Overview

### Discovery Report Template (`discovery-report.md`)
**Purpose**: Documents collaborative learning journey with partner organizations exploring web3 approaches

**Key Sections**:
- Current system mapping with organizational structure, processes, and flows
- Systemic issues identification including structural challenges and opportunity areas  
- Areas of interest that emerged organically through stakeholder conversations
- Connections to relevant web3 patterns and communities
- Potential paths for further exploration with practical next steps

**Output**: Comprehensive report that serves as foundation for intervention mapping

### Intervention Mapping Template (`intervention-mapping.md`)  
**Purpose**: Strategic planning document that identifies realistic intervention areas and implementation pathways

**Key Sections**:
- System intervention points where web3 approaches could address identified issues
- Implementation pathways with detailed steps, resources, and risk assessments
- Success metrics for both quantitative and qualitative outcomes
- Clear scope definition including exclusions and future considerations

**Output**: Detailed implementation plan that guides practical technology adoption

**Builds On**: Discovery Report findings and stakeholder engagement insights

### Implementation Retrospective Template (`implementation-retrospective.md`)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation of implementation outcomes, challenges, and lessons learned

**Key Sections**:
- Background and context connecting to earlier discovery work
- Detailed implementation journey through multiple phases with activities and outcomes
- Impact assessment including power redistribution analysis and ecosystem changes
- Challenges, solutions, and recommendations for future implementations
- Supporting materials and stories that articulate impact

**Output**: Thorough retrospective that addresses stakeholder requirements and captures learning

**Builds On**: Both Discovery Report and Intervention Mapping as foundation and reference

## Template Relationships

The templates are designed to build on each other systematically:

```
Discovery Report
    ↓ (informs system understanding)
Intervention Mapping  
    ↓ (guides implementation)
Implementation Retrospective
    ↓ (provides material for)
Case Study Synthesis
```

### Connecting Information Across Templates

**From Discovery to Intervention Mapping**:
- System maps inform intervention point identification
- Systemic issues become focus areas for intervention design
- Stakeholder interests guide pathway selection
- Web3 pattern connections suggest implementation approaches

**From Intervention Mapping to Retrospective**:
- Implementation pathways become the actual journey documented
- Success metrics provide framework for outcome assessment  
- Risk assessments connect to challenges encountered
- Resource planning informs actual resource investment analysis

**From All Three to Case Study**:
- Discovery provides background and context foundation
- Intervention Mapping explains approach and methodology
- Retrospective supplies implementation journey and outcomes
- Combined, they create comprehensive case study following SuperBenefit format

## Template Design Principles

### Stakeholder Requirements Integration
All templates specifically address funder and stakeholder reporting requirements:
- **Most significant change**: Captured prominently in retrospective executive summary
- **Power redistribution**: Dedicated analysis section in retrospective  
- **Ecosystem evolution**: Environmental changes documented throughout implementation
- **Supporting materials**: Appendices designed to collect impact stories and artifacts

### SuperBenefit Knowledge Base Integration  
Templates include metadata and structure that integrates with:
- **Pattern documentation**: References and connections to existing patterns
- **Playbook development**: Structure that supports extraction for implementation guides
- **Study format**: Retrospective follows established case study format (Background & Context → Approach → Implementation Journey → Outcomes & Reflections → Appendices)

### Practical Application Focus
Templates emphasize practical implementation over theoretical exploration:
- **Intervention language**: Focus on realistic system updates rather than experimental approaches
- **Implementation pathways**: Clear steps and resource requirements for practical adoption
- **Risk assessment**: Honest evaluation of challenges and mitigation strategies
- **Stakeholder engagement**: Practical approaches to building support and managing change

## Usage Guidelines

### Template Adaptation
While templates provide comprehensive structure, they should be adapted based on:
- **Organizational context**: Different types of organizations may emphasize different sections
- **Implementation scope**: Larger interventions may require more detailed documentation
- **Stakeholder requirements**: Different funders or partners may have specific reporting needs
- **Timeline constraints**: Some implementations may have compressed documentation requirements

### Quality Standards
All template outputs should meet SuperBenefit standards for:
- **Clarity and accessibility**: Clear language that serves both technical and non-technical audiences  
- **Educational value**: Documentation that helps others learn from the experience
- **Evidence-based insights**: Claims supported by specific examples and data
- **Integration readiness**: Format and metadata that enables knowledge base integration

## Connection to Workflows

Each template is supported by corresponding workflows in the `/workflows/` directory:
- **Discovery Report** → supported by Discovery Process Workflow
- **Intervention Mapping** → supported by elements of Discovery Process Workflow and Case Study Synthesis Workflow
- **Implementation Retrospective** → supported by Case Study Synthesis Workflow

The workflows provide step-by-step guidance for populating templates effectively, including facilitation approaches, stakeholder engagement strategies, and synthesis methodologies.

## Getting Started

1. **Review existing examples**: Study completed case studies like RPP Governance Design to understand expected depth and style
2. **Understand stakeholder needs**: Identify specific reporting requirements and success criteria before beginning
3. **Plan template sequence**: Ensure each template builds appropriately on previous work
4. **Customize appropriately**: Adapt templates to specific organizational context while maintaining core structure
5. **Use supporting workflows**: Leverage detailed workflow guidance for effective template completion
