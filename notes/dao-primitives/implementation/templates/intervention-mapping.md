## Summary

This intervention mapping document identifies realistic intervention areas and system update pathways based on the systemic issues identified in the discovery process. It provides guideposts for practical technology adoption opportunities that can address identified challenges while building on organizational strengths and stakeholder alignment.

## Purpose & Goals

### Primary Objectives
- Identify intervention areas where systemic issues could be addressed
- Map practical pathways for web3 technology adoption
- Assess feasibility and stakeholder alignment for potential interventions
- Define scope and boundaries for implementation efforts

### Success Criteria
- [Specific measurable outcomes for successful intervention]
- [Stakeholder engagement and adoption metrics]
- [System improvement indicators]

## System Intervention Points

Based on the discovery process, the following intervention points have been identified where web3 approaches could address systemic issues:

### Intervention Area 1: [e.g., Decision-Making Processes]

**Current System Issues:**
- [Specific problems identified in discovery]
- [Power dynamics or bottlenecks affecting this area]

**Intervention Opportunity:**
- How agency, voice, and power could be distributed differently
- Potential for increased collective intelligence
- Connection to stakeholders closer to impact

**Web3 Approaches:**
- [Specific web3 patterns or tools that could address these issues]
- [Examples of similar implementations in other organizations]

### Intervention Area 2: [e.g., Resource Allocation]

**Current System Issues:**
- [Specific problems identified in discovery]
- [Inefficiencies or barriers in current resource flows]

**Intervention Opportunity:**
- Potential for more direct resource coordination
- Transparency improvements in allocation processes
- Community signaling mechanisms for preferences

**Web3 Approaches:**
- [Specific web3 patterns or tools that could address these issues]
- [Examples of similar implementations in other organizations]

### Intervention Area 3: [e.g., Information Sharing]

**Current System Issues:**
- [Information silos or access barriers identified]
- [Knowledge management challenges]

**Intervention Opportunity:**
- Enhanced knowledge commons approaches
- Improved accessibility and sharing mechanisms
- Recognition systems for contributions

**Web3 Approaches:**
- [Specific web3 patterns or tools that could address these issues]
- [Examples of similar implementations in other organizations]

## Implementation Pathways

### Pathway 1: [e.g., Learning Circle Approach]

**Description:** [Brief description of implementation approach]

**Implementation Steps:**
1. [Step 1 with timeline]
2. [Step 2 with timeline]
3. [Step 3 with timeline]

**Resource Requirements:**
- Human resources: [specific roles and time commitments]
- Technical resources: [tools, platforms, infrastructure needed]
- Financial resources: [budget estimates]

**Risk Assessment:**
- Low risk: [aspects with minimal organizational disruption]
- Medium risk: [areas requiring careful change management]
- High risk: [significant challenges that need mitigation strategies]

### Pathway 2: [e.g., Small-Scale Implementation]

**Description:** [Brief description of implementation approach]

**Implementation Steps:**
1. [Step 1 with timeline]
2. [Step 2 with timeline]
3. [Step 3 with timeline]

**Resource Requirements:**
- Human resources: [specific roles and time commitments]
- Technical resources: [tools, platforms, infrastructure needed]
- Financial resources: [budget estimates]

**Risk Assessment:**
- Low risk: [aspects with minimal organizational disruption]
- Medium risk: [areas requiring careful change management]
- High risk: [significant challenges that need mitigation strategies]
