# Protocols

Protocols provide detailed operational mechanisms that define specific steps, roles, and interactions required to achieve consistent coordination outcomes in decentralized organizations. Unlike patterns which provide conceptual frameworks, protocols offer the procedural specificity that enables reliable coordination without central authority.

Drawing from OpenCivics' protocol framework, SuperBenefit's protocols are categorized across eight operational domains: membership, membranes, decision-making, sensemaking, coordination, resource allocation, learning, and culture. Each protocol includes clear step-by-step procedures, defined roles and responsibilities, and guidance for adaptation across different contexts.

## Decision-Making Protocols

Protocols that structure how collective choices are made and implemented across different contexts and scales:

### [Consent Decision Protocol](consent-decision-protocol.md)
Detailed operational mechanism for making team decisions efficiently while protecting against group anti-patterns through consent-based procedures. Designed for autonomous teams that need to balance speed with quality decision-making.

### [Resource Allocation Decision Protocol](resource-allocation-decision-protocol.md)
Structured process for making decisions about financial resources, assets, and treasury management that balances stakeholder input with efficient execution while maintaining alignment with organizational purpose.

## Coordination Protocols

Protocols that enable effective coordination between autonomous teams and entities while preserving independence:

### [Inter-Cell Coordination Protocol](inter-cell-coordination-protocol.md)
Operational mechanisms for coordinating activities, resources, and decisions between autonomous teams while preserving cell autonomy and ensuring network coherence through structured communication and shared state documentation.

## Agreement Protocols  

Protocols that systematize the formation, negotiation, and management of agreements in collaborative contexts:

### [Working Agreement Formation Protocol](working-agreement-formation-protocol.md)
Systematic process for creating, negotiating, and formalizing agreements that establish shared expectations and operational parameters for teams and networks, ensuring clarity and alignment while preserving space for evolution.

## Using Protocols

Protocols provide the operational bridge between conceptual understanding and practical implementation. They work in conjunction with:

- **Patterns**: Conceptual frameworks that inform which protocols might be appropriate
- **Primitives**: Fundamental building blocks that protocols help organize and coordinate
- **Playbooks**: Comprehensive guides that combine multiple protocols for complex implementations

Each protocol includes detailed implementation considerations, technical and social requirements, adaptation guidelines, and success indicators to support effective deployment across different organizational contexts.

## Contributing to Protocol Development

Protocol development follows an iterative process of documentation, implementation, evaluation, and refinement. New protocols should address specific coordination challenges, provide clear operational guidance, and integrate effectively with existing organizational systems.

For guidance on creating new protocols or adapting existing ones, see the [protocol template](tools/templates/protocol.md) and [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
