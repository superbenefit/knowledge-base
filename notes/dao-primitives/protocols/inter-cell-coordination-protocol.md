# Inter-Cell Coordination Protocol

_Operational mechanisms for coordinating activities, resources, and decisions between autonomous teams while preserving cell autonomy and ensuring network coherence through structured communication and shared state documentation._

## Context

Cell-based organizations achieve scale through networks of autonomous teams that coordinate effectively without sacrificing their independence or decision-making authority. However, as networks grow and become more complex, the challenge of maintaining alignment while preserving autonomy becomes increasingly difficult without explicit coordination mechanisms.

This protocol addresses the coordination challenge faced when multiple Cells need to collaborate on shared objectives, exchange resources, or align their activities without requiring centralized management. It's designed to enable effective inter-cell coordination while maintaining the benefits of autonomous team operations and distributed decision-making.

## Operational Mechanism

The Inter-Cell Coordination Protocol establishes structured interaction patterns that enable autonomous teams to coordinate effectively through transparent communication, shared state management, and clear handoff procedures:

### Step 1: Coordination Need Identification
- **Any Cell member** can identify a coordination need with another Cell or multiple Cells
- **Coordination triggers**: Resource sharing needs, overlapping objectives, interdependent deliverables, conflicting priorities
- **Documentation**: Brief description of coordination need, affected Cells, and desired outcomes
- **Initial outreach**: Informal contact with relevant Cell(s) to gauge mutual interest

### Step 2: Coordination Scope Definition
- **Affected Cells** jointly define the scope and objectives of coordination
- **Scope elements**: 
  - Specific activities or projects requiring coordination
  - Resources that need to be shared or allocated
  - Decision points that require input from multiple Cells
  - Timeline and milestone interdependencies
- **Coordination boundaries**: What remains within each Cell's autonomous authority
- **Success criteria**: Measurable outcomes that indicate effective coordination

### Step 3: Communication Framework Establishment
- **Primary communication channel**: Designated platform/method for coordination discussions
- **Communication rhythm**: Regular check-in schedule (weekly, bi-weekly, or milestone-based)
- **Information sharing protocols**: What information gets shared, when, and in what format
- **Decision escalation**: Process for handling coordination decisions that can't be resolved at working level
- **Documentation standards**: Shared format for tracking coordination progress and decisions

### Step 4: Shared State Documentation
- **Coordination state document**: Living document accessible to all participating Cells containing:
  - Current status of shared activities and deliverables
  - Resource allocation and sharing agreements
  - Decision log for coordination-related choices
  - Issue tracking for coordination challenges
  - Contact points and communication history
- **Update responsibilities**: Clear ownership for maintaining different sections of shared documentation
- **Access permissions**: Appropriate access levels for different Cell members

### Step 5: Resource Coordination Mechanisms
- **Resource sharing agreements**: Formal or informal agreements about sharing team members, tools, budget, or assets
- **Allocation procedures**: How shared resources get allocated and reallocated based on changing needs
- **Conflict resolution**: Process for handling resource conflicts or competing priorities
- **Resource handoff protocols**: Procedures for transferring resources between Cells cleanly

### Step 6: Decision Coordination Process
- **Decision categorization**: 
  - **Cell-autonomous decisions**: Made independently with information sharing to other Cells
  - **Consultation decisions**: Made by one Cell with input from coordinating Cells
  - **Joint decisions**: Made collectively by participating Cells using agreed process
- **Joint decision mechanism**: Adapted consent protocol for multi-Cell decisions
- **Implementation coordination**: How decisions get implemented across multiple Cells

### Step 7: Handoff and Transition Management
- **Work handoff protocols**: Standardized procedures for transferring deliverables between Cells
- **Quality standards**: Shared criteria for work products being handed off
- **Review and acceptance process**: How receiving Cells review and accept handoffs
- **Issue resolution**: Process for addressing problems with handoffs or deliverable quality

### Step 8: Coordination Review and Evolution
- **Regular coordination reviews**: Scheduled evaluation of coordination effectiveness
- **Process improvement**: Mechanisms for adapting coordination protocols based on experience
- **Coordination completion**: Procedures for concluding coordination relationships
- **Learning documentation**: Capture insights for future inter-Cell coordination efforts

## Protocol Categories

### Coordination Protocols

**Communication Patterns**: Structured information flows between autonomous teams including status updates, resource requests, decision consultation, and issue escalation

**Synchronization Points**: Regular coordination meetings, milestone reviews, resource allocation cycles, and decision checkpoints

**Handoff Procedures**: Standardized processes for transferring work products, resources, and responsibilities between teams

**Conflict Resolution**: Escalation paths for addressing resource conflicts, priority misalignment, and coordination breakdowns

### Membrane Protocols

**Boundaries**: Clear definition of what remains within each Cell's autonomous authority versus what requires coordination

**Permeability**: Structured mechanisms for information, resources, and decisions to flow appropriately between Cells

**Interface Standards**: Consistent formats and protocols for inter-Cell communication and documentation

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Requirements
- **Shared documentation platform** accessible to all participating Cells
- **Communication tools** that support both synchronous and asynchronous coordination
- **Resource tracking systems** for monitoring shared asset allocation and usage
- **Calendar integration** for coordination meeting scheduling and milestone tracking
- **Notification systems** for important coordination updates and decision points

### Social Requirements  
- **Coordination liaison training** for Cell members who take on inter-Cell coordination responsibilities
- **Shared understanding** of coordination principles and autonomous team boundaries
- **Conflict resolution skills** for addressing inevitable coordination challenges
- **Documentation culture** that values transparent sharing of relevant information

### Integration Points
- **Cell state documentation** should reference ongoing coordination relationships and responsibilities
- **Strategic planning processes** that identify coordination needs and opportunities
- **Resource allocation systems** that account for inter-Cell resource sharing
- **Performance evaluation** that considers coordination effectiveness alongside autonomous achievement

### Adaptation Guidelines
- **Coordination intensity** can be adjusted based on project complexity and interdependency level
- **Communication frequency** may be increased during critical coordination periods or reduced for stable relationships
- **Documentation requirements** can be lightened for simple coordination or enhanced for complex multi-Cell initiatives
- **Decision processes** can be streamlined for routine coordination or made more robust for strategic coordination

### Success Indicators
- **Coordination efficiency**: Inter-Cell activities completed on time with minimal friction
- **Autonomy preservation**: Cells maintain independent decision-making for non-coordination issues
- **Shared outcomes**: Coordination results in better outcomes than individual Cell efforts
- **Relationship health**: Participating Cells view coordination as beneficial and sustainable

const ext = dv.pages('"tools/types"')
    .where(t => t.extends === "primitive")
    .map(t => t.file.name);

dv.table(
    ["Primitive", "Description"],
    dv.pages()
        .where(p => 
            p.type && 
            (p.type.includes("primitive") || ext.some(n => p.type.includes(n))) &&
