# Consent Decision Protocol

_A detailed operational mechanism for making team decisions efficiently while protecting against group anti-patterns through consent-based procedures, enabling rapid progress while maintaining quality safeguards._

## Context

Teams operating at collaboration scale need efficient decision-making mechanisms that balance speed with quality while avoiding common group dysfunction patterns like endless debate, premature consensus, or decision paralysis. Traditional consensus-seeking approaches can be time-intensive and vulnerable to blocking, while authority-based decisions may not leverage collective intelligence or ensure buy-in from team members.

This protocol addresses the coordination challenge of making decisions quickly while ensuring that substantial concerns are heard and addressed. It's particularly valuable for autonomous teams (Cells) that need to maintain momentum while preserving the benefits of collective decision-making.

## Operational Mechanism

The Consent Decision Protocol follows a structured sequence that moves from proposal to implementation while creating specific checkpoints for input and objection handling:

### Step 1: Proposal Presentation
- **Proposer** presents the decision that needs to be made with sufficient context
- **Time limit**: 2-3 minutes for initial presentation
- **Information required**: Problem statement, proposed solution, expected outcomes
- **Format**: Clear, concise explanation without advocacy or lengthy justification

### Step 2: Clarifying Questions
- **All participants** can ask questions to understand the proposal
- **Questions only**: No opinions, suggestions, or reactions during this phase
- **Proposer** provides factual clarification without defending the proposal
- **Time limit**: 5 minutes maximum
- **Facilitation**: Any participant can help redirect discussion back to clarifying questions

### Step 3: Quick Reactions Round
- **Each participant** shares immediate gut reaction in one sentence
- **Round-robin format**: Everyone speaks once without discussion
- **No responses**: Participants do not respond to others' reactions
- **Purpose**: Surface initial emotional/intuitive responses before reasoned analysis

### Step 4: Discussion Phase
- **Open discussion** of the proposal's merits, concerns, and alternatives
- **Time limit**: 10 minutes maximum (can be extended by consent)
- **Focus**: Substantive analysis rather than positional advocacy
- **Facilitation**: Anyone can redirect conversation toward constructive analysis

### Step 5: Objection Round
- **Each participant** explicitly states whether they have reasoned objections
- **Objection criteria**: Must articulate specific harm to team's purpose or member's ability to fulfill their role
- **Format**: "I object because..." or "I consent" 
- **No debate**: Objections are stated without immediate discussion

### Step 6: Objection Integration
- **For each objection**: Proposer and team work to modify proposal to address the concern
- **Integration options**: 
  - Modify the proposal to address the objection
  - Create safeguards or monitoring mechanisms
  - Identify ways to test the proposal with less risk
  - If objection cannot be integrated, proposal fails
- **Time limit**: 15 minutes per objection

### Step 7: Final Consent Round
- **Each participant** confirms consent or raises remaining objections
- **Decision outcome**: 
  - If no objections remain: Decision is adopted
  - If objections remain: Process returns to integration or proposal fails
- **Documentation**: Decision and key reasoning recorded for team reference

## Protocol Categories

### Decision-Making Protocols

**Decision Types**: Operational choices, resource allocation, process improvements, role assignments, and strategic direction changes at team level

**Decision Makers**: All team members participate in the consent process, with specific roles:
- **Proposer**: Person bringing forward the decision for consideration
- **Facilitator**: May be the proposer or another team member ensuring process adherence
- **Participants**: All team members affected by the decision

**Decision Process**: The seven-step sequence described above, emphasizing structured progression from presentation through integration to final consent

**Approval Mechanisms**: Consent-based validation where decisions proceed when no participant raises reasoned, substantial objections that would harm the team's purpose or prevent role fulfillment

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Requirements
- **Documentation system** for recording decisions and reasoning
- **Time-keeping mechanism** (physical timer or digital tool)
- **Decision log template** for consistent documentation
- **Communication platform** for distributed teams to conduct the protocol virtually

### Social Requirements  
- **Training** in consent principles and objection criteria
- **Practice sessions** with low-stakes decisions to build familiarity
- **Cultural agreement** on the value of rapid decision-making with protection against harm
- **Facilitation skills** distributed across team members

### Integration Points
- **Cell state documentation** should reference this as the team's standard decision protocol
- **Weekly planning meetings** can use this protocol for operational decisions
- **Project planning sessions** can employ this for resource allocation and timeline decisions
- **Role allocation discussions** can leverage this protocol for task distribution

### Adaptation Guidelines
- **Time limits** can be adjusted based on decision complexity and team size
- **Objection criteria** may be refined based on team experience and organizational context
- **Documentation requirements** can be lightened for routine decisions or enhanced for strategic choices
- **Remote facilitation** adaptations may include written rounds or structured chat-based discussion

### Success Indicators
- **Decision speed**: Routine decisions completed within 30 minutes
- **Quality outcomes**: Decisions result in effective action without major unforeseen problems
- **Participation**: All team members engage actively in the process
- **Learning**: Team improves at identifying potential issues and integrating objections over time

## References and Resources

### Examples

**Resource Allocation Decision**: A team uses this protocol to decide how to allocate a quarterly budget between different project priorities, with objections leading to safeguards around monitoring spending and adjusting allocations based on results.

**Process Improvement Decision**: A team employs the protocol to decide whether to adopt a new project management tool, with concerns about learning curve leading to a modified proposal including training time and gradual rollout.

### Related Protocols

- **Resource Allocation Decision Protocol**: Specialized version for financial and asset decisions
- **Working Agreement Formation Protocol**: Used when teams need to establish new operating agreements
- **Conflict Resolution Protocol**: Employed when objections reveal deeper disagreements requiring additional process

### Supporting Primitives

```dataviewjs
const ext = dv.pages('"tools/types"')
    .where(t => t.extends === "primitive")
    .map(t => t.file.name);

dv.table(
    ["Primitive", "Description"],
    dv.pages()
        .where(p => 
            p.type && 
            (p.type.includes("primitive") || ext.some(n => p.type.includes(n))) &&
            dv.current().primitives && dv.current().primitives.includes(p.file.name) &&
            !p.file.path.startsWith("tools/") && 
            !p.file.path.startsWith("drafts/")
        )
        .sort(p => p.title, 'asc')
        .map(p => [
            `**[${p.title}](${p.file.path})**`,  
            p.description
        ])
);
```

### Case Studies

```dataview
LIST description
WHERE (
    (contains(protocols, this.file.name) OR protocols = this.file.name)
) 
AND (
    contains(type, "study") OR type = "study"
)
AND (
    !contains(file.path, "tools/") 
    AND !contains(file.path, "drafts/")
)
```

It bridges the gap between understanding consent as a principle and implementing it as a reliable operational mechanism for autonomous teams. -->
