The Completion Phase marks the final [group-phase](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/group-phase.md)  of group development, focusing on the thoughtful conclusion of groups that no longer effectively serve the network, it follows the completion of the [coordination phase](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/coordination.md). Just as biological organisms shed unnecessary structures, organizations and networks must remove groups that have served their purpose.


Every group consumes resources - whether that's team members' time, financial assets, or communication bandwidth. When a group's purpose is fulfilled, a clear process for winding down operations ensures these resources can be redirected where needed. Without such processes, organizations accumulate organizational debt, becoming rigid and inefficient. This directly undermines the flexible decision-making and resource allocation that these structures aim to achieve.


## Key Characteristics

* **Decision to Wind Down:** This could be made by the team itself or by a coordinating entity in the structure that has responsibility for the team.
* **Document Domain Learning:** It is crucial that knowledge and insights that have been generated by the group based on the work it has done are captured in line with the standards and practices of the larger network that the group has been operating in. 
* **Document Organizational learning:** It is also important that any organizational insights are captured. Decentralized organizations must ensure that the wider network are learning and evolving based on experience and knowledge that bubbles up from the individual teams who are doing the work of the network.  
* **Transfer Responsibilities:** [[tags/roles]], [[tags/tasks]] and other formal authorities and responsibilities that the group holds need to be transferred to other individuals and entities to ensure that the larger organization can continue to function effectively. 
* **Distribute Treasury Funds** Any funds or other asset held the group's treasure need to be distributed appropriately, e.g back to the organization, to departing group members, donated etc  
* **Clear Communication** Communicate the fact that the group is winding down to the network within which the group sits. This will help the rest of the network understand how its structure is changing. It also creates the opportunity for others to suggest alternatives to closing the group. 
* **Formal Closure** Archiving group documents and communication channels in accordance with organizational practices. Closing down and canceling software subscriptions and other ongoing commitments etc. Creating a final written completion document is recommended so that there is a clear articulation of the finished state of the group. 

### Challenges

* **Knowledge Loss:** Often crucial knowledge can be lost when a group finishes with key insights remaining only in the heads of departing team members. Decentralized organizations rely on the formal communication/archiving of this knowledge so that this knowledge loss doesn't not occur
* **Orphaned Funds:** As group structures change in decentralized organizations often funds can become trapped in treasury wallets. E.g if several multisig signers disappear and the treasury can no longer be accessed  
* **Loss of Access Credentials:** As groups change, specific authorities granted to groups or members of groups can become confused and potentially lost. E.g login access to an organizations social accounts or software subscriptions can be lost. There needs to be a clear handover of these credentials to prevent this happening.
