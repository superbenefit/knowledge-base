## Partnership Governance Model for the Reimagining Power Project

_==Note - this outline is designed to forward the stakeholder engagement for the RP project. We'll need to generalise it for the playbook==_
_==Note - this outline describes the interactions and relationships between members of the Stakeholder group and the Operational governance of the project. This does not describe the tooling or practices that will facilitate this relationship. These will be developed via a facilitated process where the Stakeholder group and Operational governance will make choices about the details of how they want to organise themselves.  ==_

## **Summary / TL;DR**
- The above partnership governance model creates a way for a group of stakeholders to come together to support and fund a project using web3 composable governance tooling.
- It is built on the concept of _DAOs as purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams_
- The model separates stakeholder stewardship of the project from the operational execution of the project. This allows for stakeholders to direct the purpose and high-level goals of the project but not have granular control over its strategy and execution. This in-turn, allows autonomy for the operational structure.
- The model leverages the _DAO Primitive_ design patterns to build the operational structure in a way that allows insights and intelligence from the operational levels of the project to flow into project-wide decision-making.
- This _two house_ governance model (stakeholder + operational) provides protections for both stakeholders and members of the operational structure and affords them agency to influence the project in positive ways, without either having undue control over the project. This is an experiment in reimagining power in the relationship between 1. capital providers and 2. those with high-context who are actively working on the problems to be solved. 
- ==Note - see below for a glossary of key terms used in this outline==

## Overview
- This governance model is designed to leverage web3 design patterns to produce composable forms of project governance that make new dynamics possible. It describes and facilitates a set of relationships between a **Stakeholder Group,** which represents high-level governance in the project, and an **Operational Governance** (represented by the Top Level Cell) that executes on the project. Each delivers one of two crucial functions for the project:
	1. The **Stakeholder Group** defines its shared purpose which guides the overall direction of the project. The stakeholder group also protects against operational governance decisions that would take the project away from this shared purpose.
	2. The** Operational Governance **(through the** Top Level Cell**)**, **develops the strategy and coordinates the operational activities of the project through its network of Cells. 
- The model maintains a separation between these two functions to ensure:
	1. **Stakeholder stewardship** - stakeholders, who have money, reputations, networks (and their own stakeholders) _at stake_ in the project - have the power to:
		1. Define the high-level purpose for the project. 
		2. Agree any initial starting terms for the project with the TLC. 
		3. Participate in Optimistic Governance - in unusual circumstances the Stakeholder Group can step in to prevent the operational governance from making decisions that they think will be harmful to the project. 
	2. **Operational autonomy** - power is distributed throughout the operational structure of the project.
		1. The TLC defines the strategy for the project and has autonomy to develop the operational structure as it sees fit. 
		2. Cells within the operational structure are also autonomous and are not beholden to a traditional power structure. 
		3. This allows for the operational governance to compose a governance structure that best suits the goals of the project. One where collective intelligence can emerge in the project as small teams with the most relevant context across the project make their own decisions and push decision-making up through the organisational structure.
- The partnership model includes: 
	- **Primitives** - These are the basic building blocks of DAOs, Cells, Tasks & Roles, out of which the operational structure can easily be built. 
	- **Governance design** - the guides and facilitation on how the stakeholder group and operational governance might choose to organise themselves and make decisions (policies and practices) to design the way governance will work in the project. 
	- **Tooling** - specific software tools and modules that can be used to implement the above in ways that are transparent and secure, as well as simple enough to not be a burden to operate.
- ==Note - this governance model will be one of the design patterns outlined in a more generic form in the governance playbook so that other projects and DAOs can easily pick up and use this combination of primitives, policies/practices and tools to implement their own versions of stakeholder governance.==


## Reimagining Power specific outline
## **The Stakeholder Group (SHG)**
- ### **Activities:**
	1. Defining the Stakeholder Group’s own practices (meetings, decision making etc) plus roles within the SHG - do this with support from SuperBenefit governance facilitation.
	2. Defining the SHG's shared purpose and high-level goals for the project
		1. This can be supported by SB governance facilitation.
		2. The SHG also agrees on any other requirements that it needs to specify to the TLC.
	3. The SHG then votes to approve the Cell State proposed by the TLC. This includes:
		- The TLC's own purpose and strategy (based on what the SHG has provided). 
		- Lists agreements that satisfy the requirements outlined by the SHG.
	4. Reviewing and optimistically approving operational proposals from the TLC
		1. The SHG agrees on a process for reviewing operational proposals from the TLC. 
			- The ability for members to raise concerns for discussion within the SHG before the deadline for optimistic approval. 
			- Having a process for deciding whether to block an operational proposal that is deemed dangerous.
	5. Participating in some sort of regular meeting with the TLC to understand progress, support and share ideas.


- ### Other ways that members of the Stakeholder Group can participate in the project
	- Stakeholder Group members will have very limited ability to participate in the operational side of the project. This is by design to protect against the negative coordination patterns associated with traditional models of project governances. Stakeholder Group members can however choose to participate more actively in the project by engaging in the following ways:  
		- **Become a core team member of a Cell **-** **join either the TLC or another operational Cell in the project. This will give SHG organisation members the ability to participate in operational decision-making and activities (but from the context of being a team member).
		- **Become a contributor to a Cell** - this will give SHG members the ability to participate in specific work that a Cell is doing without needing to take responsibility for the Cell as a whole (and without decision-making rights in the Cell).
		- **Make a proposal **- make either an Operational Proposal or a Stakeholder Group Proposal (if these are set up) to push forward a specific piece of work in the project.
- >
	- ## **Next steps: ****Tasks for the Reimagining Power Stakeholder Group **
		- Meet build relationships
		- Decide how it will meet and make decisions for the project (on proposals etc) 
		- Engage in a facilitated process for developing their purpose and high-level goals for the project 
		- Share their purpose and high-level goal plus requirements with the TLC
		- Approve/agree to the TLC's initial Cell State document

## **Operational governance - via the Top Level Cell (TLC)**
- The operational governance structure connects to the SGH via the Top Level Cell (TLC) 
	- ==Note - an outline of the operational Cell structure is outlined in the Key Terms section below==
- ### **Activities:**
	1. Develop the purpose and initial strategy for the project (based on what is provided by the SHG)
	2. Propose this (as part of the initial Cell State) up to the SHG for approval as the start of the partnership
	3. Make ongoing strategy and operational decisions:
		1. Decide on project priorities and budgets.
		2. Vote on proposals that come up through the operational structure.
	4. Put ongoing project budget proposals up to the SHG for optimistic approval.
	5. Providing facilitation support to the SHG.
	6. Manage the high-level compliance of the project - e.g operating agreement, legal entity etc 

## **Key terms**
1. **Partnership Governance Model - **the overarching term to describe the design pattern that uses a set of stakeholders to steward the high-level governance of a project - while the execution of the project is carried out by an operational structure. The Partnership Governance Model includes primitives, guidelines (for policies and practices) and technical implementation _(note - this was previously referred to as the "Stakeholder Module")_
2. **Stakeholder group (SHG)** - the group of key people and organizations that have either a financial or some other partnership in the project. They perform a small-scale version of community governance, stewarding the project by providing purpose and high-level goals while also protecting the project from governance capture by backstopping the operational governance. The SHG can’t force operational governance to do anything, but they can stop them from doing something if it is deemed necessary.
3. **Operational governance** - the structure of Cells (operational teams) that execute on the project.
	1. **Top Level Cell (TLC)** - the highest Cell in the structure. The TLC coordinates the Cells in the network below it and interacts with the SHG
	2. **Cell** - an autonomous team of people who define and execute on work that the project needs to complete. Cells are autonomous, which means that they make their own decisions about their purpose, practice (how they organise themselves and make decisions) and what work they do. Cells can have:
		1. **A core team** - a team of fewer than 10 people who have shared responsibility and decision-making authority over the Cell
		2. **Contributors** - independent members of the network who the Cell can engage with to perform tasks on behalf of the Cell - but who do not have shared responsibility and decision-making authority over the Cell
		3. **Coordinating Cells** - Cells can also do the job of representing and coordinating clusters of others Cells that are working towards overlapping goals
4. **Operational autonomy - **describes the separation between operational governance and stakeholder/community governance
	1. The operational governance is independent from the Stakeholder group. The SHG can’t force the operational governance to do anything, but they can stop them from doing something if it is necessary.
	2. Operational autonomy is critical for reimagining power in these systems. Without it power will continue to flow down from the top in traditional (and less effective) ways.
5. **Operational Proposals - **decisions made by the operational governance structure. These occur at different scales depending on the type of decision. E.g:
	1. **At the Cell scale (collaboration scale)** - Core team members decide on their own structure, activities and budgets
	2. **At the Coordinating Cell scale (coordination scale)** - a Coordinating Cell can make decisions on behalf of a cluster of Cells e.g setting budgets and allocating tasks to be carried out by Cells 
	3. **At the top level Cell scale (coordination scale) **- proposals made at the highest level of the project are optimistically approved by the Stakeholder Group. Optimistic approval means that proposals are assumed to pass unless the Stakeholder Group specifically chooses to block them  
6. **Stakeholder group proposals** - decision-making in the stakeholder group. This needs to be defined by the stakeholder group themselves:
	1. **At the stakeholder group scale (collaboration or coordination scale)** - develop/select simple decision-making protocols for clear, accountable, transparent decision-making
	2. **At the community/network scale (constituency scale)** - if the stakeholder group chooses, they can solicit the community/network for proposals as part of how they define the purpose and direction of the project or for specific activities to support and fund. Over time the SHG may choose to decentralise their governance beyond being a stakeholder group and becoming more of a broader community governance layer. This could transform the project into more of a full DAO structure with decentralised constituency scale governance at its highest level. 
7. **Optimistic governance** - Operational proposals from the TLC to the SHG are assumed to pass unless they are actively blocked by the SHG. There will be a defined mechanism for the TLC to notify the SHG of a new proposal and a timeframe within which the SHG can assess any proposal before it automatically passes (unless the SHG chooses to block it). This governance mechanism recognises that the TLC are best placed to make the strategic and operational decisions for the project, but the optimistic governance mechanism utilises the SHG as a final protection against fundamentally misaligned or malicious proposals. 


## _Notes on how this governance design manages risk while reimagining power_
- ### For the Stakeholder Group Members:
	1. **The ability to vote down operational proposals:**
		1. When operational activities are grossly out of alignment with the stated purpose of the project. 
		2. When actions in the operational governance are in breach of operating (and other) agreements that are core to the safe running of the project. 
		3. When there is a risk that governance capture is occurring and a proposal is deemed malicious. 
	2. **The right of exit /voting with one’s feet** - members of the SHG can leave at any time withdrawing uncommitted funds. __
		- _Funds and other resources should be committed to the project in relation to cycles where at the end of a cycle if a member is not happy with how the project is going they can withdraw without creating undue instability for the people working on the project._
	3. **Operational participation** - the ability to influence the project by getting involved as core team members or contributors in the operational structure of the project. 
	4. **Proposing new activities** - the ability to create proposals to fund new operational activities separate from existing operational plans.
- ### For the operational participants in the project:
	1. **Autonomy of one’s own Cell - **means that the Cell can plan around the specific needs of the core team members of the Cell. The fact that a Cell is autonomous means that they are not at the mercy of a traditional hierarchy.
	2. **The right of exit - **the ability to participate in multiple Cells across the project and across other projects in the network creates anti-fragility for individual contributors. This gives people the ability to leave Cells when either the Cell dynamics or larger multi-Cell coordination dynamics are not satisfactory (the ability to vote with one's feet). Multiple projects in the same DAO network give people the ability to safely opt out of projects that are not meeting their needs. 
	3. **The ability to make operational proposals to the TLC - **such as proposing the creation of new Cells and to make other changes to the operational structure
	4. **The ability to make a community proposal** directly to the stakeholder group (if implemented by the SHG)
