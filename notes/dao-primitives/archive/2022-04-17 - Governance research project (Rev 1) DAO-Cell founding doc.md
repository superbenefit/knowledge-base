# Governance research project (Rev 1) DAO-Cell founding doc




_This document is an experiment in minimum viable set up of a DAO-Cell. It is designed to cover the important primitives of governance and operations that are needed to give a cell a basic structure that provides coherence, transparency and a foundation to build in more complex governance and management as it is needed.  #[[227 Project - governance design experiment #1]] _
## Purpose & Insight
This is outlined in the original proposal #222 Proposal for Governance Research Project (Rev1) 
#[[222 Proposal for Governance Research Project (Rev1)]] 
## Decision making: governance & treasury
### Coordination protocols & tools
- **Relationship and Responsibilities to SuperBenefit **- This project is set up to work as an internal project for SB and will be working closely with the rest of the SB network. But the core team of this project has full autonomy over all activities and decisions. SuperBenefit governance only exerts decision-making power over this project via approving any future funding requests.
- **Governance principles** - starting out referring to the [SuperBenefit governance design principles](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/work/55) 
- **Governance structure **- starting with simple structure of:
	- **Point person - **is the main point of contact for the project @Rowan
	- **Core team** - who vote on governance decisions and have shared responsibility for the project @Rowan @Heenal @MBaldwin
	- **Contributors **- who participate - @s
- **Decision-making **- to start with decisions will be made in person in the weekly meeting doc and a-synch in the discord channel. Decision format - [Fist-to-five](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/work/55) 

## Treasury
- **Wallet**
	- Multi-sig set up in GnosisSafe on the Polygon network
	- 3 signers with 2 needed to to approve a transaction
	- Signers are:
		- @Rowan  - yeoro.eth
		- @heenal  - heenal.eth
		- @MBaldwin - michellebaldwin.eth****
	- Starting budget 10,000 $SPRB - approved in snapshot vote [here](https://snapshot.org/#/superbenefit.eth/proposal/0x163c2bd331d5063dd72a7448108c06994c21a6fb2c3b6bb649e2a19f6bea50cf) 
- **Financial record keeping**
	- Using a google spreadsheet as a starting point to link decisions made in discord and clarity to on-chain transactions in a version controlled way
- **Rewarding contributors **
	- We will allocate $SPRB 1k per core team at the start of the project. 
	- We will allocate micro-bounties to contributors via proposals in meetings/discord. 
	- We will run a coordinape at appropriate inflection points to allocate tokens to reward core contributors (we will ask for additional budget from SB to fund this if needed)
- ### Tokens 
	- This cell will not have its own token to begin with. It will use $SPRB for rewarding contributions and non-token governance for decision-making

## Project management 
- **Weekly team meeting** - 45mins to sync up on progress and clear blocks
- **Revolutions** - the project will be planned around sprint style mini-revolutions 
- **Task management** - Tasks will be recorded in team meeting and Discord conversations. They will be self-managed by individual contributors to begin with
