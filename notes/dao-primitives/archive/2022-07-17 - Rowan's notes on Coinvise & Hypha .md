	- Tools for projects to create their own social tokens. 
		- A platform where creators and communities can:


			- **Create their own social token:** on a fixed supply, bonding curve or vesting schedule, where the creators gets to **own** full custody of tokens minted. Additionally, there's no cuts for tokens minted on Coinvise.
			- **Open Social Graph for Creator DAOs / Tokenized Communities:** Discover & grow your community, communicate and contribute towards other creators. Earn rewards for joining communities, and more.
			- **Airdrop social tokens:** send and receive social tokens on social media, private channels or in bulk to multiple people, through a unique claimable link.
			- **Create an NFT:** We envision NFTs as a gateway to utilize social tokens. NFTs aren't limited to digital art, it can be a way to fundraise, bootstrap liquidity for your social token, create incentive mechanisms and so much more.
			- **Rewards & Bounties:** Reward your community for contributions & adding value through social tokens.
		- Who's it for

			- **For Creators:** Provide exclusive access to events, early access to NFTs/drops, content, discounts, fundraise directly from fans, merchandise, status and a sense of loyalty and retroactive airdrops as rewards.

			- **For Communities:** Governance, voting rights (transparent decision making), incentive mechanisms for community members to hold and contribute value going forward.

			- **For Platforms:** Programmable assets, governance, and value generated buy individuals on the platform.

		- Why Coinvise?

			- **Platform agnostic:** Share tokens on any social media platform, on Ethereum main network or side chains including Matic Network.

			- **Low barrier to entry + pseudo anonymity:** no long waiting times, unnecessary forms/clicks, get started within 30 seconds.
			- **Creator first:** No cuts on tokens minted on Ethereum or Polygon.

			- **Platform Design:** we don't take a cut off your tokens, creators have full control over their social tokens, owning a 100% in your custody. (SAFE)

			- **Security:** We're a team of developers building a social platform with high standards for security and taking necessary measures (smart contract audits).
		- Notes thoughts 
			- They Coinvise are focused on social tokens. They aim to have developers integrate their tooling into projects via APIs as a building block for running the token dynamics of a project. 
			- It looks like it is designed to be user friendly and aims to give people an easy way to get started
			- They are being used by a lot of projects some of them quite high quality.... although I see that they mention superBenefit as part of their community (and as a creator) so I don't know how many of these are actually using their tooling.  
			- Without having a decent go I can't see how easy and/or how much "vendor lock-in" is likely. I.e how easy it would be to go beyond using them as a starting point to get something started and migrate to a more customisable tooling approach
