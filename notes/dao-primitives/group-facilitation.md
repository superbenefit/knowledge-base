The DAO primitives facilitation framework is a work in progress. It is designed to provide a structure for designing organisational forms based on the DAO primitives that can be implemented using reliable organisational patterns from the Pattern Library.

The framework will help an external facilitator or a team themselves to work through a set of questions that will reveal the design of the core organisational structure (what the team, organisation is designed to be and do) and the basic agreements that will govern its members and relationships.

From design and set of agreements we can choose from the pattern library the different social processes and technical tool-sets that the organisational structure (team, DAO etc) will use to implement the above design and agreements.

## Modeling Group State

### Foundational Agreements

Based on the properties discovered during evaluation, determine what types of basic agreements your group will need right now.

### Working Agreements

As a starting point for the facilitation process we can use a process like **[The Ready's OS canvas](https://www.theready.com/os-canvas).** This provides a simple starting set of questions to outline the desired set organisational relationships and functions. From here the appropriate patterns from the pattern library can be chosen to implement these.
