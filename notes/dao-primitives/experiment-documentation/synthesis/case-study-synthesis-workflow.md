# Case Study Synthesis Workflow

This workflow provides comprehensive guidance for synthesizing Discovery Reports, Intervention Mapping documents, and Implementation Retrospectives into compelling case studies that demonstrate practical web3 adoption for community resilience and power redistribution.

## Overview

The case study synthesis process transforms three distinct documentation stages into integrated narratives that serve multiple stakeholder needs:

- **For Funders**: Demonstrating impact, power redistribution, and return on investment
- **For Communities**: Providing replicable models and practical guidance
- **For SuperBenefit Ecosystem**: Enriching pattern libraries and knowledge commons
- **For Broader Web3 Community**: Contributing to collective understanding of practical adoption

The synthesis process preserves the richness of each stage while weaving them into coherent stories that highlight key insights, patterns, and lessons learned.

## Three-Stage Synthesis Process

### Stage 1: Cross-Document Analysis and Pattern Extraction

The first stage involves systematic analysis across all three source documents to identify recurring themes, successful interventions, and emergent patterns.

#### Core Analysis Framework

**Narrative Thread Development**
Begin by mapping the journey from initial discovery through final outcomes:

1. **System State Evolution**: Track how the organizational system evolved from initial discovery through intervention to final outcomes
2. **Stakeholder Journey**: Document how different stakeholders experienced and participated in the transformation
3. **Intervention Pathway**: Trace the logical progression from identified challenges through intervention design to implementation results
4. **Learning Arc**: Capture how understanding evolved throughout the process, including unexpected insights and course corrections

**Pattern vs Context Identification**
Distinguish between reusable solutions and context-specific adaptations:

- **Reusable Patterns**: Solutions, approaches, or frameworks that could be applied in other contexts
- **Adaptation Strategies**: How patterns were modified for specific organizational contexts
- **Context Dependencies**: Factors that significantly influenced implementation (organizational culture, resources, external constraints)
- **Innovation Points**: Novel solutions or approaches that emerged during implementation

**Impact Synthesis**
Integrate quantitative and qualitative outcomes across all three stages:

- **Power Redistribution Evidence**: Specific instances where decision-making authority, resource control, or information access shifted toward communities
- **System Resilience Improvements**: Ways the intervention strengthened the organization's capacity to respond to challenges
- **Community Capacity Development**: Skills, capabilities, or resources that were developed within the community
- **Ecosystem Changes**: Broader impacts on partner networks, related organizations, or sector practices
