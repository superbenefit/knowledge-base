title: Commitment to Accountability Implementation Guide
description:
---

Your Commitment to Accountability defines how community members interact day-to-day. These are shared behavioral expectations that all members commit to -- the culture you're actively building together.

Unlike the Code of Conduct (non-negotiable safety), these are negotiable, subject to interpretation, and evolve with your community. When breaches or disagreements occur, you use the Conflict Response Plan to work through them.

## Creating Your Commitment to Accountability

Ask your community:

- "What makes this space work well?"
- "What behaviors help us collaborate effectively?"
- "What values do we want to embody?"

Transform responses into **"We commit to..."** statements that combine values with concrete behaviors.

**Structure:** Value + How we practice it

**Examples:**

- "We commit to direct communication. When we have concerns, we raise them with the people involved."
- "We commit to learning in public. We share our mistakes and questions."
- "We commit to distributed leadership. We take initiative and support others who do the same."

Balance aspirational (values/intentions) with practical (specific behaviors). Keep the list focused enough that people can remember and use them.

## Example Commitments

**Communication:**

- We commit to assuming good intent while naming impact. When someone's actions affect us negatively, we approach them believing they didn't mean harm while still being honest about how it affected us.
- We commit to asking clarifying questions before making assumptions. When we're confused or concerned about someone's words or actions, we ask them directly what they meant rather than filling in the blanks ourselves.

**Collaboration:**

- We commit to making our work visible so others can engage. We share drafts, works-in-progress, and thinking processes so people can contribute and learn alongside us.
- We commit to crediting others' contributions. When we build on someone else's ideas or work, we name them and acknowledge their role.

**Conflict:**

- We commit to addressing tensions directly and early. When something bothers us, we bring it up sooner rather than letting it build.
- We commit to participating in the Conflict Response Plan when needed. When direct conversation doesn't resolve things, we engage with mediation or other processes.

**Power and Access:**

- We commit to noticing who's not in the room. We ask whose voices are missing from decisions and conversations.
- We commit to making space for quieter voices. We notice who's dominating conversations and actively create openings for others to contribute.

## Key Principles

Use clear, active language. "We commit to listening" is clearer than "We value good listening."

Include both aspirational and practical commitments. Without some concrete behaviors, commitments become empty platitudes.

Always include: **"We commit to participating in the Conflict Response Plan when conflicts arise."**

Post them visibly, reference them explicitly in practice, and review regularly. These are alive -- they should evolve as your community learns.

## Implementation

1. Facilitate community discussion about what makes the space work well
2. Draft "We commit to..." statements combining values and behaviors
3. Keep the list focused
4. Present to community for consent and refinement
5. Post visibly and reference in practice
6. Review and update regularly

Remember: breaching a commitment isn't shameful. It's information that signals someone needs support, clarification, or that the commitment itself needs adjustment.
