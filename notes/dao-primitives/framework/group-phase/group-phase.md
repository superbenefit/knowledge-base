Groups evolve through distinct phases, each demanding unique tools and approaches. Understanding these phases is crucial for effective group function and coordination. Clearly defining a group's phase allows for the design of an appropriate set of tools and constraints for the group, affording it both internal coherence and coherence in the network within which it exists.  

The DAO Primitives Framework identifies five phases of group development. Understanding these phases is a key component of designing decentralized structures that leverage a network of autonomous teams. This group phase framework can enable the creation of a governance design that can balance autonomy and structure throughout a group's lifecycle.

For example, an emerging idea being explored by a small team may require nothing more than basic communication channels for discussion and ideation. In contrast, a team allocated significant resources to perform core functions within a DAO will need robust organizational structures to safely and transparently fulfill its responsibilities.

A clear phase framework serves two critical functions: it helps groups understand what structural elements they need at any given point in their development, and it enables broader network participants to identify what organizational standards a group must meet to be considered trustworthy for engagement, resource allocation, and collaboration.

The specific implementation of group phases will vary based on the network's nature and values. For instance, a highly permissionless network might impose minimal structure requirements especially during early group formation stages, while a different network might establish specific criteria for groups at each developmental phase. These design choices should reflect the network's core requirements, principles, and governance approach.

The five group phases are: 

- [Conversation Phase](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/conversation.md)
- [Formation Phase](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/formation.md)
- [Organization Phase](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/organization.md)
- [Coordination Phase](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/coordination.md)
- [Completion Phase](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/completion.md)

**1. [Conversation/Ideation Phase:](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/conversation.md):** This initial phase focuses on open exploration and idea generation.  It's a period of brainstorming, sharing perspectives, and identifying potential synergies *before* formal structures or processes are established.  The primary goal is to establish a shared vision and understanding, laying the groundwork for future phases.  *Key characteristics* include open exploration, shared vision development, relationship building, and informal processes.  *Challenges* include maintaining momentum, managing diverse perspectives, and avoiding premature closure. 

**2. [Formation Phase](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/formation.md):** Building upon the Conversation Phase, this stage transitions to establishing basic structure and roles.  Early engagement with minimal formal structure is key, emphasizing trust-building and defining initial procedures. The primary goal is to create a functional framework for the group to operate within. *Key characteristics* include early engagement, role definition, trust-building, minimal structure, and procedure establishment. *Challenges* include defining roles, managing conflict, maintaining momentum, and balancing structure and flexibility.

**3. [Organization Phase](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/organization.md):**  The Organization Phase builds on the Formation Phase, transitioning from a basic framework to a fully established, formal structure with defined processes and governance mechanisms. This phase is characterized by the implementation of clear systems, procedures, and decision-making frameworks, enabling the group to operate efficiently and effectively. The primary goal is to create a sustainable and scalable organizational structure.  *Tools and practices* include governance documents, DAO tooling, project management software, and communication protocols.

**4. [Coordination Phase](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/coordination.md):** This phase focuses on integrating the group into networks and collaborating with other groups.  It builds upon the Organization Phase, shifting from internal focus to external collaboration, resource sharing, and alignment with broader network goals. The primary goal is to maximize the group's impact and effectiveness within a larger ecosystem. [Learn more](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-scale/coordination.md)

**5. [Completion Phase](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/completion.md):** 
This final phase focuses on the intentional conclusion of groups that have fulfilled their purpose or are no longer effectively serving the network. The primary goal is to properly redistribute resources, preserve valuable knowledge, and formally close operations. *Key characteristics* include documenting learnings, transferring responsibilities, distributing remaining funds, and clear communication about the closure. Without effective completion processes, networks accumulate "organizational debt" as outdated structures persist, undermining the flexibility and efficiency that DAOs aim to achieve.
