# Coordination Phase

---

The Coordination Phase represents the mature [group-phase](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/group-phase.md) where [[tags/groups|groups]] transition from establishing their structures and processes in the [organization phase](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/organization.md) to focused execution on their [[tags/purpose|purpose]] and goals. In this phase, a group leverages its fully implemented operational capabilities and [[tags/governance|governance]] systems to deliver maximum value and impact. The emphasis shifts from internal development to effective delivery, with [[tags/coordination|coordination]] becoming a key mechanism for accessing necessary [[tags/resources|resources]], capabilities, and support from the broader [[tags/networks|network]] or ecosystem.

The coordination phase is where a group, as an autonomous (or semi-autonomous) entity, both leverages and contributes to the power and collective intelligence of the decentralized [[tags/networks|network]] it inhabits (or in the case of a DAO, is creating).

When the Coordination phase is complete, a group may either evolve into a [[tags/governance|governance]] or operational structure or enter a [completion phase](completion.md) as its [[tags/purpose|purpose]] is fulfilled.

## Key Characteristics

- **Purpose-Driven Execution:** The group's activities are tightly aligned with its core [[tags/purpose|purpose]], with clear prioritization of high-impact initiatives that advance its goals.
- **[[tags/resources|Resource]] Sharing:** The group optimizes the use of its internal [[tags/resources|resources]] while accessing and/or contributing resources externally through [[tags/networks|network]] relationships.
- **Decentralized [[tags/coordination|Coordination]]:** The group fully implements the onchain tooling and [[tags/practices|practices]] that allow its [[tags/governance|governance]] and operational structure to leverage decentralization in effective ways.
- **Operational Excellence:** Internal systems and processes function smoothly, allowing focus to shift from setup and maintenance to optimization and results.
- **Evolution:** The group evolves its [[tags/governance|governance]] and operational structure and [[tags/practices|practices]] over time in response to its evolving context.
- **Measurable Impact:** The group consistently delivers and documents concrete outcomes that advance its [[tags/purpose|purpose]] and provide value to the broader [[tags/networks|network]].

## Functional Elements

### Activities

The activities of a Coordination phase group are outlined in their [group state](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-state.md) documentation. Broadly these include:

- **Internal [[tags/governance|Governance]]:** Execution of the group's ongoing governance structure and [[tags/practices|practices]]. Including keeping group state documentation up to date and accessible to participants in the [[tags/networks|network]].
- **Network [[tags/governance|Governance]]:** Participating in external decentralized governance processes within coordinating [[tags/networks|networks]].
- **Strategic Execution:** Implementing the group's strategy through coordinated action that delivers on key objectives and milestones.
- **Operational [[tags/coordination|Coordination]]:** Strategic planning, [[tags/resources|resource]] allocation, contributor and partner coordination, etc.
- **External Partnerships:** Establishing and executing on partnerships with other autonomous entities in the decentralized [[tags/networks|network]] or other stakeholders from outside the network.
- **Impact Measurement:** Tracking and communicating the outcomes and value created by the group's activities.
- **Feedback Integration:** Systematically gathering and responding to feedback from users, stakeholders, and [[tags/networks|network]] participants.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Documenting and sharing learnings, tools, and approaches that could benefit others in the [[tags/networks|network]]. Including consistently updating and sharing its [group state](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-state.md) documentation.

### Navigating Challenges

- **Maintaining Momentum:** Sustaining energy and [[tags/progress|progress]] toward goals despite obstacles and competing priorities.
- **Balancing Flexibility and Focus:** Adapting to changing circumstances without losing sight of core objectives and priorities.
- **Principled Evolution:** Ensuring that as the group evolves, it grows in principled ways, avoiding centralization, governance capture, bureaucratic bloat, etc. Leveraging decentralized tooling and [[tags/practices|practices]] to ensure [[tags/governance|governance]] and operations stay true to design.
- **Maintaining Alignment with Coordinating Entities:** Ensuring that new opportunities and partnerships remain aligned with the group's fundamental [[tags/purpose|purpose]] and with the purpose of the [[tags/networks|network]] that the group is participating in.
- **Consistently Communicating [[tags/progress|Progress]]:** Ensuring that the [[tags/networks|network]] that the group is coordinating with can see and understand the progress it is making and trust that it is a good [[tags/coordination|coordination]] partner.

### Signs of Readiness for Evolution

A coordination phase group may be ready to evolve to a new form or enter completion when:

- The group's [[tags/purpose|purpose]] has been substantially fulfilled or has evolved significantly
- The operational context has changed in ways that require fundamental restructuring
- New capabilities or approaches have emerged that would better serve the purpose
- The group's work has been effectively systematized or automated
- The group can no longer maintain the energy and commitment of team members and contributors in order to do its work

## Tools and Practices

### State Documentation

During the Coordination Phase, the group's [group state](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-state.md) documentation is the critical interface between the group and the [[tags/networks|network]] it inhabits. It contains the [[tags/agreements|agreements]] between the group and other coordinating entities, as well as references to web3 tooling and onchain information that allows for effective decentralized [[tags/coordination|coordination]] between the group and its network.

At coordination phase, if a group fails to maintain their state documentation, or to communicate it clearly and transparently, this should be a red flag for any entity or [[tags/networks|network]] coordinating with the group.

**[[tags/purpose|Purpose]] Elements:**

- Evolution of the group's strategy and goals in line with its purpose
- Evolution of its relationship with/to other entities in its [[tags/networks|network]] and the network itself

**[[tags/practices|Practice]] Elements:**

- Updated [[tags/governance|governance]] practices that evolve as the group grows and changes
- Maintaining [[tags/agreements|agreements]] and internal and external [[tags/coordination|coordination]] processes
- Evolving contributor engagement and coordination mechanisms
- Maintaining [[tags/treasury|treasury]] and [[tags/resources|resource]] allocation practices
- Ongoing retrospectives and feedback processes and ongoing governance and operational evolution
- Records of major group [[tags/decisions|decisions]] and transactions

**[[tags/progress|Progress]] Elements:**

- Implementation of onchain tools where practical
- Collaborative project management tools tracking group activities and deliverables
- Communication platforms - meetings, group channels, broadcast channels
- Shared workspaces, documentation, and data platforms
- Documentation of learnings and group evolution
- Impact metrics that track progress toward key objectives - clear articulation of how activities connect to broader [[tags/networks|network]] goals

### Technical Implementation

Coordination Phase groups typically employ various technical tools to support execution and [[tags/coordination|coordination]]. At this phase these should, where practical, be onchain tools. This promotes the decentralized properties that are designed into the group's [[tags/governance|governance]]. Using onchain tools is especially important for:

- Governing the group's [[tags/treasury|treasury]] and allocation of [[tags/resources|resources]].
- Managing changes in the overall [[tags/governance|governance]] structure of the group, i.e., who has [[tags/decisions|decision-making]] authorities.
- Information for external stakeholders. [[tags/coordination|Coordination]] partners need to have trust in the group's processes at a glance.

There is always a balance to be struck between the flexibility of a lightweight minimal organizational structure, and the need for solid tools, [[tags/practices|practices]], processes, and policies to support a group to function successfully. At coordination phase, the group should have its structure fully implemented with technical tooling, in line with what it needs to deliver on its stated [[tags/governance|governance]] and operational design.

## Success Indicators

A coordination phase has been successful when:

- **[[tags/purpose|Purpose]] Advancement:** The group consistently delivers outcomes that meaningfully advance its purpose
- **[[tags/resources|Resource]] Effectiveness:** Available resources are deployed efficiently to create maximum impact
- **[[tags/networks|Network]] Support:** The group maintains ongoing support from the networks that it inhabits
- **Contributor Engagement:** The group successfully attracts and retains contributors with aligned skills and interests to deliver on its strategy
- **Clear [[tags/governance|Governance]]:** The group executes on its governance practices in an effective and [[tags/transparency|transparent]] way
- **Operational Fluidity:** The group's ability to create and manage operations via tools like [[tags/roles|roles]] and [[tags/tasks|tasks]] can scale coherently to meet the operational needs of the group
- **Adaptive Capacity:** The group effectively executes on retrospectives and other feedback processes, and translates insights generated through these processes into changes in the governance and operational structure of the group
- **Documented Impact:** Clear evidence demonstrates the value and outcomes created by the group's activities

The coordination phase represents the period when a group's full potential is realized through effective execution on its [[tags/purpose|purpose]]. To do this, it effectively coordinates with the decentralized [[tags/networks|networks]] it inhabits.

When successful, the group creates tangible value for itself and for the broader [[tags/networks|networks]] while building a foundation for sustainable impact and evolution.
