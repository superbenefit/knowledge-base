The Formation Phase represents the critical transition from open exploration to structured commitment within decentralized networks. Following the ideation and relationship-building of the [Conversation Phase](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/conversation.md), groups in Formation begin establishing clear boundaries, formalizing agreements, and developing the minimal viable structure needed for coordinated action. This phase transforms emerging potential into concrete initiatives while creating the foundation for more sophisticated organizational forms to evolve. 

The formation phase usually culminates in a proposal or some other ask from the community or governance structure that the group is forming within. This is often in order to gain funding/resources, partnerships, legitimacy etc to allow the group to fulfill the purpose that it has outlined for itself.

When the formation phase is complete, a group is ready to move on to the [organization phase](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/organization.md).

## Key Characteristics

* **Purpose Definition:** The group articulates a clear, specific purpose statement that defines its reason for existence and intended contribution to the broader network. 
* **Structured Decision-Making:** Simple but formal decision processes begin to replace purely informal consensus, enabling clearer accountability and execution. 
* **Initial Agreements:** Members make explicit commitments about participation, contributions, and shared expectations, establishing the basis for mutual accountability. 
* **Lightweight Documentation:** The group develops basic documentation of its purpose, practices, and progress through an initial [cell state](notes/dao-primitives/patterns/collaboration-scale-patterns/cell-state.md) or nucleus document. 
* **Resource Planning:** Initial budgets, timelines, and resource needs are identified and documented to support formal proposals for funding or support. 
* **Minimal Role Definition:** Core roles and responsibilities emerge and are assigned, though these remain somewhat fluid and may evolve substantially. 
* **Team Formation:** The self-selected group solidifies into an identifiable team with shared commitments, moving beyond loose association.



## Functional Elements 

### Activities
- **Purpose Crystallization:** Refining broad interests into a specific, actionable purpose that provides clear direction. - 
- **Proposal Development:** Creating formal proposals to seek community endorsement, funding, or permission when needed. - 
- **Initial State Documentation:** Documenting the group's purpose, practices, and plans in an early [nucleus](notes/dao-primitives/patterns/collaboration-scale-patterns/cell-state.md) document. This outlines vision and practical implementation of the group.  
- **Commitment Establishment:** Members explicitly commit to specific future contributions, roles, or responsibilities. - 
- **Resource Mapping:** Identifying needed skills, knowledge, and resources for successful execution. 
- **Boundary Definition:** Clarifying what is and isn't within the group's scope and authority. 
- **Integration Planning:** Establishing how the group will connect and coordinate with the broader network or community.




### Challenges

- **Achieving Specificity:** Moving from broad aspirations to precise, actionable objectives without losing alignment with deeper purpose.
- **Balancing Structure and Emergence:** Creating enough structure to enable effective action without prematurely constraining evolution and adaptation.
- **Maintaining Momentum:** Keeping energy and engagement high while shifting from open exploration to more structured commitment.
- **Formalizing Without Bureaucratizing:** designing useful structures without creating unnecessary processes that hinder action.
- **Establishing Credibility:** Demonstrating sufficient capability and seriousness to earn support from the broader community.

### Signs of Readiness for Evolution 

A formation phase group may be ready to evolve to a more structured [organization phase](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/organization.md) when:

- A clear purpose and scope of activities has been defined and documented 
- Key roles have been established and filled with committed individuals 
- Basic decision-making processes are being consistently followed 
- The group has begun execution of initial activities and can demonstrate progress
- There is a need for more sophisticated coordination mechanisms to manage increasing complexity 
- Initial community support and resources have been secured via a proposal or similar
- The group's [group state](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-state.md) document is sufficiently developed to outline the structure to be implemented in the organization phase

## Tools and Practices 

### State Documentation 

Creating a lightweight but clear [group state](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-state.md) document is a critical practice during the Formation Phase.

The development of the group state document helps the group to get clear and precise about the group's goals and how it is planning to achieve them. It also communicates this to others in the community or operational network, forming the basis for a proposal or other mechanism for community or operational endorsement, funding, partnership etc. 

#### Essential Components for Formation Phase State Documents: 

**Purpose Elements:** 
- Clear purpose statement connecting to broad community goals 
- Specific problem or opportunity being addressed 
- Initial goals and success criteria 
 
 **Practice Elements:** 
- Key team members and their roles 
- Basic decision-making protocols 
- Simple meeting structures and communication channels 
- Initial resource needs and treasury management approach 

**Progress Elements:** 
-Initial roadmap or timeline 
- First planned deliverables 
- Basic tracking mechanisms for activities

### Proposal Development 

Formation often requires creating one or more proposals to secure support, resources, or formal recognition from the broader community or governance system. Effective proposals typically include: 

Proposal development can centre around the group state document outlined above, combined with whatever specific asks that the group my have of the community or governance system. For example:

- Establishment funding
- Ongoing funding
- Access to community assets
- Formal recognition within the governance structure 
- Mandate to act on the community's behalf


### Support resources 
- **Governance design support:** Accessing specific guidance and resources for governance design can save a lot of time and result in better overall governance design. This knowledge garden has a wealth of resources to support this work including governance patterns, frameworks, guides and case studies. 
- **Group Facilitation** Accessing governance facilitation support can assist with helping the group to get to agreement on exactly how they want to define the groups [group state](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-state.md). and which governance primitives and practices the group wants to adopt. 
- **Technical support** Once the fundamentals of the group's governance design is established, sourcing specific support to select the right technical tools to implement it is hugely beneficial.

## Success Indicators 

A formation phase has been successful when: 

A proposal to the larger network or to the community 
A design for the entity being created that can be executed on when the proposal is passed 

- **Documented Purpose:** A clear, compelling purpose statement has been articulated and documented 
- **Shared Commitments:** Team members have made explicit commitments to specific contributions 
- **Operational Structure:** Basic operational structures and processes have been outlined ready for implementation  
- **Resource Access:** Initial resources needed for execution have been secured or identified 
- **External Recognition:** The group has been acknowledged and endorsed by relevant stakeholders 
- **Execution Readiness:** The group has everything needed to begin executing on its purpose

The formation phase establishes the foundation for effective collective action by translating inspiration into structured commitment. It bridges the gap between exploration and execution, creating the conditions for a group to deliver meaningful value while maintaining alignment with network purpose.
