## Definition

DAOs within the DAO Primitives Framework defined as **purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams** that coordinate through transparent agreements, rather than hierarchical management structures. They represent the highest-scale organizational primitive that encompasses and coordinates other primitives (Cells, Roles, Tasks) to create coherent collective action. They can also coordinate at network scale with other DAOs, organizations and stakeholders. 

## Core Characteristics

Contain a network: DAOs contain a network of groups operating at different levels of [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-scale/group-scale|group-scale]] and stages of[[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/group-phase|group-phase]]. By coordinating this network a DAOs create flexible, adaptive organizational forms that can evolve organically without requiring a top-down structure.

**Purpose-Aligned Coordination**: DAOs maintain coherence through shared network purpose that enable autonomous teams to coordinate and make aligned decisions without central authority. Purpose serves as the gravitational center that guides decentralized DAO decision-making.

**Emergent Collective Intelligence**: By distributing authority and enabling permissionless innovation, DAOs aim to harness collective intelligence and potentially outperform traditional organizational models, while maintaining adaptability to changing conditions.

**Transparent Operations**: DAOs operate through documented state, visible agreements and clear interfaces that build trust and enable coordination across autonomous teams without requiring traditional management hierarchies. This allows the DAO to manifest as a coherent whole, while allowing for autonomy for the entities that make it up. 

## DAO State 

DAOs create coherence and make successful coordination possible through maintaining a comprehensive DAO-state. 

**Purpose**: DAOs document their foundational "why" and high-level goals - this shared vision creates network coherence and guides decision-making throughout the DAO at different scales. Purpose agreements establish the boundaries within which teams can operate independently while maintaining alignment with collective aims.

**Practice**: DAOs establish transparent governance and coordination protocols - how decisions are made, how resources are allocated, how conflicts are resolved, and how new teams and the larger operational structure of the DAO is formed. These agreements are where innovative new governance and operational designs become reality. 

**Progress**: DAOs maintain visible documentation of network activities, resource flows, team formation, and collective achievements. This transparency enables members of the network to understand, trust, as well as participate in DAO governance. 

## Phase & Scale Considerations

**Phase Evolution**: DAOs typically begin as a collection of individuals/early community in Conversation/Formation phases, then evolve through Organization (establishing governance frameworks) to Coordination (operating and evolving) and potentially Completion (transforming or dissolving when purpose is achieved).

**Multi-Scale Operation**: DAOs coordinate across the framework's four scales - from Collaboration Scale (harnessing individual teams) through Coordination Scale (networks of teams) to Constituency Scale (large stakeholder communities) and Network Scale (inter-DAO collaboration).

**Flexible Configuration**: DAOs can configure their entities and agreements for different phases and scales depending on the purposes that they serve - some teams/networks of teams could be structured for operational efficiency, others for creative exploration, with governance mechanisms appropriate to their current phase and scale needs.

## Network Relationships

**Cell Coordination**: DAOs serve as the convening context for coordinating Cells, providing shared infrastructure, resource flows, and governance frameworks that enable independent teams to work together effectively.

**Role Integration**: DAOs establish the governance context within which Roles operate - defining how roles are created, assigned, held accountable at the highest level of the network, while creating flexibility for specific role definition at smaller scales in the network.

**Task Orchestration**: DAOs coordinate Tasks across teams through transparent workflows, resource allocation mechanisms, and accountability systems that enable complex collective action without centralized micromanagement.

**Delegation:** DAOs at the highest level of the network (constituency scale) often opt to delegate operational activities to a network of Cells (coordination scale). This can provide a good foundation for strategy development and efficient management of operations, while keeping the network decentralized and purpose aligned at the highest level. 

**Inter-DAO Networks**: DAOs can connect with other DAOs, networks and organizations to form larger networks, enabling resource sharing, knowledge exchange, and coordinated action across organizational boundaries while maintaining their distinct purposes and governance.

## Implementation Patterns

**Group State Documentation**: DAOs implement systematic documentation of Purpose/Practice/Progress across all constituent teams, creating the transparency needed for decentralized coordination and accountability. See [[dao-state]]

**Facilitation Frameworks**: DAOs often employ structured approaches to group development and organizational design, helping teams navigate phases and scales while maintaining network coherence. See [[governance-design]]

**Governance Primitives**: In the DAO Primitives Framework, DAOs utilize the other 3 [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/group-primitives|group-primitives]] to implement their governance and operational design:
- [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/cells|Cells]] - The autonomous teams that comprise DAO networks
- [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/roles|Roles]] - Specialized functions within DAO coordination systems
- [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/tasks|Tasks]] - Coordinated actions across DAO networks

**Permissionless Innovation**: DAOs establish lightweight processes for new team formation, experimental initiatives, and proposal development that enable innovation without requiring centralized permission or oversight. But then have decentralized mechanisms for approving permissions and resource allocation to these new teams as they evolve.  

## Examples in Practice

**All in for Sport**: The DAO primitives framework has been applied to design the AIFS governance model and partnership with SuperBenefit. More can be read about this example here: [[all-in-for-sport]]. 

**RPP Governance**: This project is a good example of how a larger DAO structure (SuperBenefit) can support multi-stakeholder partnerships within its broad community governance umbrella. This shows how complex governance and operations can be made simple and effective while maintaining appropriate levels of high-level governance. See [[rpp-governance-design-study]]
