## Definition

Tasks within the DAO Primitives Framework function as **agreement primitives** that establish formalized commitments about specific [[tags/actions|actions]], deliverables, and coordinated activities that need to be accomplished within [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/daos|DAO networks]]. As defined in [[tags/tasks|our lexicon]], Tasks are "specific, coordinated actions or duties assigned to [[tags/roles|roles]] or [[tags/agents|agents]] within decentralized systems" - serving as the operational [[tags/agreements|agreements]] that define **what** specific work needs to be accomplished, while [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/roles|Roles]] define **who** has the [[tags/responsibilities|responsibility]] and [[tags/authorities|authority]] to coordinate that work.

## Core Characteristics

**Operational Agreement Primitive**: Unlike [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/cells|Cells]] and [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/daos|DAOs]] which function as entities (network nodes), Tasks serve as [[tags/agreements|agreements]] (network edges) that define specific [[tags/actions|actions]] and deliverables that need to be accomplished to advance network [[tags/purpose|purpose]] and maintain [[tags/coordination|coordination]].

**Action-Oriented Infrastructure**: Tasks create the operational foundation for network activity by establishing clear [[tags/agreements|agreements]] about specific deliverables, timelines, and outcomes while enabling autonomous execution without requiring centralized micromanagement.

**Complementary to Roles**: Tasks work in conjunction with [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/roles|Roles]] to operationalize network [[tags/coordination|coordination]] - [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/roles|Roles]] defining "who" has [[tags/responsibilities|responsibility]] and [[tags/authorities|authority]], while Tasks define "what" specific [[tags/actions|actions]] and deliverables need to be accomplished.

**Distributed Execution**: Tasks enable coordinated [[tags/actions|action]] across network entities while preserving [[tags/autonomy|autonomy]] in how work is accomplished, creating structured workflows that can operate across multiple [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/cells|Cells]] and contexts.

## Task State

**Task State** documentation enables Tasks to function effectively as [[tags/agreements|agreements]] primitives across [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/daos|DAO networks]]. Each Task maintains transparent state documentation that captures the essential information needed for both task execution and network [[tags/coordination|coordination]].

This [[tags/transparency|transparent]] task state makes tasks addressable and understandable across the wider network, not just internally to the [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/cells|entity]] that created them. By documenting task state in accessible formats, other [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/cells|Cells]], [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/roles|Roles]], and network participants can discover, understand, and coordinate with ongoing work directly, enabling the distributed execution that characterizes effective [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/daos|DAO]] networks.

Task State consists of three core components:

**[[tags/purpose|Purpose]]**: Documents the specific deliverables, outcomes, and [[tags/goals|goals]] that the task is designed to accomplish within the network context. This creates clarity about the task's contribution to broader objectives and enables other network participants to understand how to coordinate with or build upon the work.

**[[tags/practices|Practice]]**: Establishes the operational [[tags/agreements|agreements]] about how the task will be executed, what [[tags/resources|resources]] are needed, who is [[tags/responsibilities|responsible]] for completion, and how the task interfaces with other tasks and network activities.

**[[tags/progress|Progress]]**: Maintains documentation of task execution status, milestones achieved, and deliverables produced. This creates [[tags/transparency|transparency]] that enables network-wide [[tags/coordination|coordination]] and allows other participants to assess task status and identify opportunities for collaboration or dependencies.

Together, these three dimensions create comprehensive task documentation that enables tasks to function as effective [[tags/agreements|agreements]] primitives while maintaining the [[tags/transparency|transparency]] needed for network-wide [[tags/coordination|coordination]] and execution.

## Phase & Scale Considerations

Tasks are a flexible primitive that can be used across all scales, phases and timeframes in a network. 

**Task Scope**: can vary greatly depending on the goal being sought and where this occurs in the network.
- Scale - super task vs sub task. 
- Phase
- Timeframe -  
- Governance target
- 

**Cross-Phase Adaptability**: Tasks evolve through [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/group-phase|group phases]] as network activities mature - from informal task coordination in [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/conversation|Conversation Phase]] to structured task management in [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/organization|Organization Phase]] to cross-network task coordination in [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/coordination|Coordination Phase]].

**Multi-Scale Implementation**: Tasks operate across all [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-scale/group-scale|group scales]] - within [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-scale/collaboration|Collaboration Scale]] teams for direct execution, across [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-scale/coordination|Coordination Scale]] networks for multi-entity workflows, and at [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-scale/constituency|Constituency Scale]] for network-wide initiatives and governance activities.

**Complexity Adaptation**: Task definition and coordination mechanisms adapt to scale requirements - simple, relationship-based task coordination at collaboration scale versus formal, documented task workflows with explicit dependencies and [[tags/accountability|accountability]] systems at coordination and constituency scales.

## Network Relationships

**Entity-Task Integration**: Tasks provide the operational interfaces between [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/cells|Cells]] and [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/daos|DAOs]], enabling entities to coordinate work effectively by establishing clear [[tags/agreements|agreements]] about specific deliverables, timelines, and [[tags/accountability|accountability]] across the network.

**Role-Task Coordination**: Tasks work closely with [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/roles|Roles]] to operationalize network activity - [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/roles|Roles]] defining "who" has [[tags/responsibilities|responsibility]] and [[tags/authorities|authority]], while Tasks define "what" specific [[tags/actions|actions]] and deliverables need to be accomplished to advance network [[tags/purpose|purpose]].

**Network-Wide Workflow**: Through documented task [[tags/agreements|agreements]], the network creates [[tags/transparency|transparency]] about ongoing work and dependencies that enables distributed execution while maintaining overall coherence and [[tags/accountability|accountability]].

## Implementation Patterns

**Cell-Internal Tasks**: [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/cells|Cells]] coordinate internal tasks to manage their operational activities and deliverables while maintaining clear interfaces about their work with other Cells and the broader network.

**Cross-Cell Task Workflows**: Tasks that span multiple [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/cells|Cells]] or require coordination between different network entities, enabling complex workflows without hierarchical project management structures.

**Contributor Coordination Tasks**: Tasks used by [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/cells|Cells]] to engage external contributors, often working in conjunction with [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/roles|Roles]] to create clear [[tags/agreements|agreements]] about specific contributions and deliverables.

**Network-Level Initiatives**: Tasks that coordinate activities across the broader [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/daos|DAO]] network, enabling collective action on shared objectives while preserving entity [[tags/autonomy|autonomy]] in execution approaches.

## Examples in Practice

**Cell Deliverable Tasks**: Specific deliverables that [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/cells|Cells]] commit to producing for the broader network, with clear task state documentation that enables other entities to coordinate and build upon the work.

**Cross-Network Coordination Tasks**: Tasks that facilitate collaboration between multiple [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/cells|Cells]] or between different [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/daos|DAO]] networks, often involving shared [[tags/resources|resources]] or coordinated timing.

**Contributor Engagement Tasks**: Tasks that enable [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/cells|Cells]] to coordinate with external contributors, creating clear [[tags/agreements|agreements]] about specific contributions while maintaining network [[tags/transparency|transparency]] and [[tags/accountability|accountability]].
