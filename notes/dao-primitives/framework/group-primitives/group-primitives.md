These primitives are the fundamental building blocks that we use to create purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams. 

The term "primitive" is used in many different contexts to mean slightly different things. In this context we use "primitive" to describe these 4 fundamental building blocks out of which network governance and operational structures can be build. 

## Entities & Agreements
Network theory defines networks as being made up of nodes (the entities or objects in the network) and edges (the relationships or interactions between those nodes). 

For designing governance and operational structures we define nodes and edges as Entities and Agreements. Entities being the structures within the DAO (or other decentralized network) and agreements being relationship infrastructure, the commitments and responsibilities that are agreed upon between autonomous actors in the network. 

## Primitives

- [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/cells|Cells (Primitive)]]
- [[daos|DAOs (Primitive)]]
- [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/roles|Roles (Primitive)]]
- [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/tasks|Tasks (Primitive)]]

To allow for governance system to be easily designed we lean on these 4 structures. Each one has enough definition to be useful in design, but can be configurable in a multitude of ways to allow for many different governance approaches and patterns to be implemented. 

## Phase & Scale
The primitives are designed to evolved through the different stages of [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/group-phase|group-phase]] and also deliver on different [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-scale/group-scale|group-scale]] requirements of the governance and operational system being designed. 

## State

Each primitive has a concept of state, an internally documented, externally visible description of the entity or agreement's Purpose, Practice and Progress, so that this can be seen and understood independently by anyone in the network. 

This transparency allows for decentralized coordination across the network. At any point in time the whole of the governance and operational structure (all of its entities and agreements) can be seen and understood. This allows the network to manifest as a coherent whole, while allowing for autonomy for the entities that make it up.
