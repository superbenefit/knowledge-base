These primitives are the fundamental building blocks that we use to create purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams. 

This is a network - the network has nodes and edges. The primitives we list here are entities and relationships. 

As we build networks we need to design in entities and relationships - we are using these primitives as descriptions for these entities and relationships
