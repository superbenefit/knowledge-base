# Framework Directory

This directory houses the practical application of the DAO Primitives conceptual framework, guiding you through the phases and scales of organizational development. The theoretical model is described in [`framework.md`](notes/dao-primitives/framework/framework.md).

## Understanding Organizational Context: Phase, Scale, and State

This framework helps you understand and navigate the complexities of organizational development by focusing on three key aspects:

* **Phase:** The stage of development your group is currently in.  This influences the tools, practices, and approaches that will be most effective.  The phases are: Conversation, Coordination, Formation, and Organization.  [`/phase/`](phase/) contains detailed documentation for each phase.

* **Scale:** The size and complexity of your organization.  Different scales require different strategies and approaches.  The scales are: Collaboration, Constituency, Coordination, and Network.  [`/scale/`](scale/) provides detailed analysis for each scale.

* **State:** The overall properties and characteristics of your organization at a given point in time.  Understanding your organization's state is crucial for making informed decisions and planning for future growth.  [`state.md`](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-state.md) provides a comprehensive overview of group states and transitions.

## Using the Framework: A Practical Roadmap

This framework offers a practical roadmap for building and managing effective organizations. It guides you through:

1.  **Diagnosing Your Current State:** Identifying your group's current phase and scale.
2.  **Selecting Appropriate Tools:** Choosing the primitives and patterns best suited to your context.
3.  **Planning for Growth:** Anticipating and planning for upcoming transitions.
4.  **Maintaining Coordination:** Ensuring effective coordination as your organization evolves.


### Example: Contextualizing Phase and Scale

A group in the *Conversation Phase* at a *Collaboration Scale* will have vastly different needs and priorities than a group in the *Organization Phase* at a *Network Scale*. This framework helps clarify these distinctions, guiding you towards the most effective strategies and tools.
