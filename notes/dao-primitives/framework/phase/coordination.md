The Coordination Phase builds upon the [organization phase](notes/dao-primitives/framework/phase/organization.md), transitioning from a focus on internal structure and processes to integration with external networks and collaboration with other groups. This phase is characterized by active collaboration, resource sharing, and alignment with broader network goals. The primary goal is to maximize the group's impact and effectiveness within a larger ecosystem.

## Key Characteristics

* **Network Integration:**  The group actively participates in and contributes to broader networks.
* **Collaboration:**  The group collaborates with other groups to achieve shared goals.
* **Resource Sharing:**  Resources, information, and expertise are shared across networks.
* **Interoperability:**  Systems and processes are designed to ensure interoperability with other groups.
* **Alignment:**  The group's activities are aligned with the goals and priorities of the broader network.

### Challenges

* **Managing Interdependencies:**  Coordinating activities and managing dependencies across multiple groups can be complex.
* **Resolving Conflicts:**  Disagreements may arise between groups regarding goals, priorities, or resources.
* **Maintaining Alignment:**  Ensuring that the group's activities remain aligned with broader network goals can be challenging.
* **Communication:**  Effective communication across multiple groups is crucial.

## Tools and Practices

* **Interoperability Protocols:**  Protocols and standards for communication and data exchange between groups.
* **Shared Data Platforms:**  Platforms for sharing information and resources across networks.
* **Collaborative Project Management Tools:**  Tools for coordinating activities and tracking progress across multiple groups.
* **Communication Channels:**  Established communication channels for effective communication across networks.

### Coordination Phase Patterns

```dataviewjs
$= dv.list(
    dv.pages()
    .where(p => 
        (p.type === "pattern" || (Array.isArray(p.type) && p.type.includes("pattern"))) &&
        (p.phase === "coordination" || (Array.isArray(p.phase) && p.phase.includes("coordination"))) &&
        !p.file.path.startsWith("tools/") &&
        !p.file.path.startsWith("drafts/")
    )
    .map(p => `[[${p.file.path}|${p.title}]]`)
)
```

### Coordination Phase Primitives

```dataviewjs
const ext = dv.pages('"tools/types"')
  .where(t => t.file.frontmatter?.extends === "primitive")
  .map(t => t.file.name);

$= dv.list(
  dv.pages()
    .where(p =>
      (p.type === "primitive" || (Array.isArray(p.type) && p.type.includes("primitive"))) &&
      (p.phase && p.phase.some(s => s.includes("coordination"))) &&
      (p.type.includes("primitive") || ext.some(n => p.type.includes(n))) &&
      !p.file.path.startsWith("tools/") &&
      !p.file.path.startsWith("drafts/")
    )
    .map(p => `[[${p.file.path}|${p.title}]]`)
);
```

## Successful Coordination Phase Outcomes

A successful Coordination Phase results in:

* Effective collaboration with other groups.
* Efficient resource sharing and utilization.
* Alignment with broader network goals and priorities.
* Enhanced impact and effectiveness within the larger ecosystem.

The Coordination Phase is crucial for maximizing the group's impact and achieving its goals within a larger context.  A well-managed Coordination Phase ensures the group can effectively collaborate and contribute to the broader network.
