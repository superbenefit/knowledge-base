# DAO Primitives Group Facilitation Guide

# Purpose of this Guide
This guide helps facilitators navigate to use the DAO Primitives Framework to support a group develop a decentralized governance and operational structure. It follows steps to assess group context, design appropriate governance and operational structures, and them implement and operationalize these systems. It serves as a roadmap to navigate the through the existing DAO Primitives framework resources, showing facilitators how to sequence and apply the tools developed here.

# I. Introduction: Facilitating Using the DAO Primitives

This guide draws from the DAO Primitives Framework and utilizes many of the documents and tools in the framework. I works through 3 basic steps in the facilitation flow; Discover, Design & Implement:

1. **Discover** learn about the group and understand the starting context 
2. **Design** governance and operational structure using organizational primitives and patterns
3. **Implement** the design using the structured processes from implementation guides

This process will very and its depth and rigor based on the scale and phase of the group that is being facilitated. For example, setting up a single cell within an existing tile structure could be a relatively fast process because you are dealing with a small collaboration scale team making mostly internal decisions about how it will structure and govern itself. At the other end of the spectrum however, if you're dealing with a large group looking to establish a DAO, this process group facilitation process will be much more involved with a much more complex structure needing to be designed and broader sense-making and design needing to be sourced from a much larger group of stakeholders. 

1. **Assessing Context**: Understanding the group's current phase, scale, and state
2. **Identifying Needs**: Determining the most pressing challenges and opportunities
3. **Selecting Patterns**: Choosing appropriate organizational patterns from the [Pattern Library](notes/dao-primitives/implementation/patterns/patterns.md)
4. **Implementing Solutions**: Adapting and applying these patterns to the specific context
5. **Evolving & Iterating**: Continuously refining the approach based on feedback

# I. Discover 

**Explore Existing Context**
Explore the existing context by developing a simple first outline of the group's [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-state|group-state]]. 
The [[group-state-template|group-state-template]] can be used as a way to capture this existing context. 

1. **Purpose** 
	- What is the existing purpose for the group?
	- Is there a clear well defined purpose statement?
	- Are there clear goals defined?
	- Is there a larger organization or network purpose or impact model that the group is working towards?
2. **Practice** 
	- Who is participating in the group and what roles to they hold?
	- What internal agreements are already in place within the group?
	- What dependencies and commitments exist between the group and its wider network?
	- What resources does the group have access to and how are these managed
3. **Progress**
	- What work has the group been engaging in and what progress has it made?
	- What tools is the group using for managing communications, project management, decision-making etc?
	- What group budgets or implementation plans exist?
4. **Phase**: What group phase is the group at?
5. **Scale**: What group scales are represented in the group's activities
6. **Other Context**: What other context is relevant to the groups governance and operational design?

# II. Design 
**Design Governance & Operational Structures**

## 1. Define Purpose and High-Level Goals
*If they have not already been defined*
### Activity: Purpose Statement Development

  - Gather key stakeholders to define essential purpose
  - Identify values that governance must uphold
  - Document high-level goals for governance structure
  - Create impact model if needed 

## 2. Define Requirements

### Activity: Requirements Mapping

- **Governance** 
	  - Decision scope - what types of decisions need governance
	  - Stakeholder inclusion - who needs representation
	  - Scale - what different group scales need to be included in governance
	  - Time horizons - what timeframes must governance address
	  - Resource considerations - what resources governance will manage
	  - Technical constraints - what factors shape implementation
- **Operational**
	- Activities - how will the group operationalize its purpose to achieve its goals
	- Autonomy - the level of decentralization of authority and responsibilies needed for operations to succeed
	- Information systems - how does information need to flow through the operational structure for it to work effectively
	

## 3. Design Governance & Operational Model

### Activity: Choose a Governance Approach

Based on the above purpose and requirements, narrow in on a particular governance approach. There are many different ways to think about decentralized governance. The [[community-governance]] pattern outlines several that might be worth considering. The choice will depend on many factors such as the specific needs of the group and the work that it will do, and the structure and culture of the existing networks that the group will be coordinating with.


### Activity: Compose a Governance & Operational Model

Based on the chosen approach build out a governance and operational model based on the [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/group-primitives|group-primitives]] as a starting point:

- [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/daos|daos]] - for purpose-aligned networks
- [[drafts/framework backup/group-primitives/cells|cells]] - for small autonomous teams
- [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/roles|roles]] - for ongoing responsibilities and permissions
- [[notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-primitives/tasks|tasks]] - for specific work deliverables

Examples of using these primitives to compose governance and operational model can be found in [[case-studies]] e.g [[rpp-governance-design]].

Technical 







- **Purpose**: Choose building blocks that match the requirements of the group's design. 
- **Application**: Guide group through primitive selection:


### D. Choose Implementation Approach
- **Resource**: [Implementation Guides](notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/)
- **Purpose**: Select the appropriate detailed implementation process
- **Application**: Choose based on governance type needed:
  - [Community Governance](notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/implementation-guide-community-governance.md) - for constituency-scale governance
  - [Operational Governance](notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/implementation-guide-operational-governance.md) - for coordination-scale operations
  - [Multi-Stakeholder Governance](notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/implementation-guide-multi-stakeholder-governance.md) - for network-scale partnerships

## IV. Step 3: Implement Using Framework Structure

### A. Follow Implementation Guide Process
- **Context & Orientation**: Review problem space and principles with group
- **Design Governance Model**: Use patterns to design specific structure
- **Implementation Steps**: Follow phased implementation approach
- **Launch & Evolution**: Establish feedback and adaptation processes

### B. Apply Group Phase Implementation Sequence
- **Resource**: Use phase descriptions from chosen implementation guide
- **Process**: Follow the four-phase implementation:
  1. **Conversation Phase**: Shared understanding and alignment
  2. **Formation Phase**: Basic agreements and initial structures
  3. **Organization Phase**: Formalized systems and processes
  4. **Coordination Phase**: Ongoing operations and evolution

### C. Document Group State Throughout Process
- **Resource**: [Group State Framework](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-state.md) and patterns
- **Purpose**: Create transparency for internal coherence and external coordination
- **Application**: Maintain documentation of:
  - Purpose evolution and refinement
  - Practice development and formalization
  - Progress tracking and communication

### D. Select and Implement Patterns
- **Resource**: [Pattern Library](notes/dao-primitives/patterns/patterns.md)
- **Purpose**: Apply proven solutions for specific implementation needs
- **Application**: Choose patterns organized by scale:
  - [Collaboration Scale Patterns](notes/dao-primitives/patterns/collaboration-scale-patterns/collaboration-scale-patterns.md)
  - [Coordination Scale Patterns](notes/dao-primitives/patterns/coordination-scale-patterns/coordination-scale-patterns.md)
  - [Constituency Scale Patterns](notes/dao-primitives/patterns/constituency-scale-patterns/constituency-scale-patterns.md)
  - [Network Scale Patterns](notes/dao-primitives/patterns/network-scale-patterns/network-scale-patterns.md)

## V. Integration Points and Facilitation Tips

### A. Using Framework Phases as Facilitation Stages
- Each [Group Phase](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-phase/group-phase.md) description contains guidance for what the group needs
- Use phase characteristics to structure facilitation sessions
- Help groups understand their natural progression through phases
- Reference implementation guides for detailed phase-specific activities

### B. Scaling Facilitation Approach
- Apply [Group Scale](notes/dao-primitives/framework/group-scale/group-scale.md) insights to facilitation methods
- Adjust participation and decision-making processes to match group size
- Prepare for scale transitions as groups grow
- Select patterns appropriate for current and projected scale

### C. Common Integration Challenges
- **Phase Transitions**: Help groups recognize readiness to move between phases
- **Scale Changes**: Anticipate governance needs as groups grow
- **Pattern Selection**: Guide choice of patterns that support group evolution
- **Documentation**: Maintain group state through changes and transitions
