Different groups go through specific phases in their development. The more these phases can be understood, mapped and then tools and practices can be provided to facilitate each phase, the more coherent, useful and efficient the function of a group can be and the more effectively it can coordinate with other groups.Â   

For applying the DAO primitives we consider groups to have 5 distinct phases:

- [Conversation/ideation](notes/dao-primitives/groups/phase/conversation.md) - no constraints.
- [Formation](notes/dao-primitives/groups/phase/formation.md) - early engagement with minimal process.
- [Organisation](notes/dao-primitives/groups/phase/organization.md) - formal structure/state.
- [Coordination](notes/dao-primitives/groups/phase/coordination.md) - integration into operating networks.
- Completion - graceful closing down when no longer needed.

In the context of team development, group phase tends to parallel some stages of the [5 stages of development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman's_stages_of_group_development).
