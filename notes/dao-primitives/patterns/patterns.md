# DAO Primitives Pattern Library

The Pattern Library provides reusable solutions to common organizational challenges in decentralized systems. These patterns combine primitives into practical implementations, showing how to effectively integrate the core concepts from the DAO Primitives framework.

The patterns are organized into categories to facilitate discovery based on your organization's specific needs:

## Pattern Categories

- **[Cell Patterns](notes/dao-primitives/patterns/collaboration-scale-patterns/collaboration-scale-patterns.md)**: Patterns related to implementing and managing Cells (small autonomous teams) in DAO networks
- **[DAO Patterns](dao-patterns/dao-patterns.md)**: Patterns related to implementing and managing DAOs as networks of autonomous teams
- **[Decision Patterns](decision-patterns/decision-patterns.md)**: Patterns related to decision-making processes in decentralized organizations
- **[Coordination Patterns](notes/dao-primitives/patterns/coordination-scale-patterns/coordination-scale-patterns.md)**: Patterns related to coordination between teams and entities in decentralized networks

## Using the Pattern Library

To effectively leverage the Pattern Library:

1. **Assess Your Context:** Use the Group Facilitation Framework to determine your group's current phase and scale. This assessment will highlight the challenges you face and the types of solutions you need.

2. **Identify Relevant Patterns:** Navigate the Pattern Library using the categories above. Focus on patterns that address the challenges identified in step 1, considering the specific needs of your group's phase and scale.

3. **Review and Adapt:** Carefully review the selected patterns to understand their underlying principles and implementation details. Adapt the patterns to your specific context, ensuring they align with your group's goals and constraints.

4. **Implement and Iterate:** Implement the chosen patterns and monitor their effectiveness. Iterate on your implementation based on feedback and experience, refining your approach as needed.
