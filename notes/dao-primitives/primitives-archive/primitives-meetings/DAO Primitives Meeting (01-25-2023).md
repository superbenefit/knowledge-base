# DAO Primitives Meeting - 25/1/23

1. UNA set up 
	- The community governance needs to be sufficiently decentralised and are recommended to have a separate entity - e.g a ricardian LLC
2. Moloch / Kali / DAO Hause - Leaning towards Kali because it is designed to create the Ricardian LLC entity. 
3. Telegram / Discord ? - is there a better way? - Clarity and Sobol require discord to be useful
	- Perhaps have a very simple set up in discord - we would need to make sure that the set up and management of the discord. Discord permissions are very granular if needed
	- Rather has a discord template - we can spin one up and hack on it. 
	- Just have Community Experience section with events and navigation and then CELLS with a community and a core channel for each. And then a channel for each team of teams.
