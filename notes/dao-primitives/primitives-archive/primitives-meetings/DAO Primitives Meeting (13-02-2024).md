# Meeting Agenda

## Updates

- Allocation and distribution of $energy token complete

- 

## Discussion Items

- (Rowan) Review session plan and set up 

- (Rowan) Ideas for developing the community engagement 

  - Look at the usecases outside of the largescale western usecases. There are a tonne of usecases that are very different from the centralised western usecases

  - We need a coherent internal narrative. There are 2 distinct pieces. 1. the western high scale model. 2. the broader more diverse opportunity in the global south 

  - At the next WP meeting discuss with the stewards the possibility of the broader community being developed vs the more narrow western usecase being tested in Durham. How might we think about the funding of the prototype and also fund the broader community activities and then projects that emerge from it. 

  - Notes from conversation with  

    - No expectation for the community to raise the funding or build the protocol

    - How do we turn the community into a generative space 

    - Content strategy - Overview video, Litepaper draft, Publishing questions that come up as posts, 

    - Create a way for people to contribute and get rewarded immediately e.g - Harvest ideas around attestations and incentives that would work for them
