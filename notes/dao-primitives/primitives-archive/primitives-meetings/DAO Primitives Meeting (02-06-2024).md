## Discussion Items

- **_Longer Items:_**

  - (Rowan) Work on the strategy for the DAO primitives workstream in the RPP

    - Possible pieces

1. Develop the core high-level model into something that can be easily understood and shared

2. Identify several key patterns that we want to experiment with. Take these through:


1. Basic primitives

2. Facilitation - schemas, templates, tooling (hats, charmverse etc

3. Implementation - hands on experiments 

4. Playbook - documenting the the above and into a sharable pattern


1. Possible patterns


1. Creating and coordinating a Cell - Cell state, tasks, roles, creating new Cells etc


1. Possibly use this in an experiment with AIFS 


1. Partnership model/pattern - creating a partnership between a DAO and other orgs using the primitives (e.g the RPP)

2. The 2 house governance pattern 


1. Possibly use the revamp of SB governance as the usecase for this


1. For each pattern:


1. Build out primitives, facilitation and implementation

2. Experimental case study

3. Blog posts

4. Playbook entry
