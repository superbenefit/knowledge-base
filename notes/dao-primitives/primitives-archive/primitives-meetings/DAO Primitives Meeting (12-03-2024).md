# Meeting Agenda

## Updates

-  WP stakeholder deck nearing completion

- 

-  page requested by GC - How to populate?

## Discussion Items

-  

- Can we keep action items in their respective meeting pages? Putting other teams' action items here makes them hard to track. 

  - Keeping other work in other meetings would help too, unless there's a need to fill some primitives-specific function (thinking of WREEP here). We're packing a lot into these meetings

- Syncing up on DAO primitives and RPP strategy

- **_Longer Items:_**
