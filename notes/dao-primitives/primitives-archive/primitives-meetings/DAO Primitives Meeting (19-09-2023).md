- ## Discussion Topics
	- What structure do we need to put in place for RPP and EEP for contracting - specifically establishing the stakeholder/TLC structure? (Rowan)
		- The financial stewardship covers the bases of a contract
		- The stakeholder group (including the financial steward) can communicate any requirements that they need from the relationship. This (along with the purpose/direction is referenced in the TLC Cell State (and stored somewhere else). This is the basic starting point for the stakeholder and TLC partnership.
		- 
	- Review DSL in #[[P-257 DAO Primitives Framework]] (rather)
	- Can we surface the AIFS hats tree in Sobol so that we can demo it for RPP and stakeholders (rowan)
	- Sobol for visualising projects (rowan)
		- Setting up Sobol for SP as a way of demonstrating out governance structure 
		- Set up a role for every group in sobol
		- 
	- Review Heenal's comments on stakeholder doc (rowan)
		- Hey team, I looked through the Stakeholder Model doc on Clarity again and I wonder if "Stakeholder Model" is the best term to use. It seems confusing.
		- As it says in the doc's summary section, "[The Stakeholder Model] describes and facilitates a set of relationships between a **Stakeholder Group** which represents high-level governance in the project and an **Operational Governance** (represented by a Top Level Cell of Cells)."
		- To simplify slightly, the Stakeholder Model is about the relationships between both high-level governance and operational governance. I think a name that captures this duality would be clearer and easier to grasp (for stakeholders/other external parties) than Stakeholder Model (which puts the emphasis on the stakeholder side of things and not the operational side of things).
		- Maybe something to do with "two-house governance". "Two-house community governance" or "two-house stakeholder model" or something.... I think that that could resonate with people as they will understand what two houses means, and they will understand the separation between "legislative" and "executive" functions of the governance model. 
		- That sparked a thought for me - now that we've modelled the legislative and executive governance functions, what about the "judicial" functions? To put it another way - functions such as conflict resolution, accountability, restorative justice (?). Not saying we have to examine this deeply right now but it feels like the "judicial" piece needs to be acknowledged/included within the model - it's part of what holds the circle together (the circle around TLC and the Stakeholder Group) or, to put it more figuratively, it maintains the container. Or maybe there's another way to answer questions like: how is the system maintained? What happens if the system breaks (or someone tries to break the system)?
		- Just my two cents! Forgive me if I've got the wrong end of the stick or have missed something!
		- I have some thoughts about how to structure all the info in the doc to make it more accessible for new stakeholders, too, but wanted to clarify this first and make sure I'm on the right page! Thanks!
