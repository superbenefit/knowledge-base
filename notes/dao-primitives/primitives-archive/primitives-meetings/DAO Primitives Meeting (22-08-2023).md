- Topics for next week:
	- Systems transformation sunset feedback
		- Lacked:
			- An onboarding structure/process. I think it would be valuable to create a more clarified way to onboard new folks into the DAO.
			- Pre-informed, pre-advertised agenda for each meeting. Sometimes it felt like the meetings were on simply because it was part of the routine. I think it would be beneficial to develop a decision matrix on whether to meet/not and co-create + share the an agenda ahead of time
			- Incentives for new members to stay engaged and feel like they own a part of the process/DAO
			- Lacked clarity about when the cell's work was complete, even though it was clear that energy had shifted 
			- Lacked capacity to write one or more blogs to tell the story of the cell and its learnings
			- started with idea about creating a web3 library but shifted purpose because not a lot of projects/protocols
			- My biggest learning is about the concept of system transformation. its widely discussed, but not sure everyone is clear about it or have a shared definition - Ash
		- Longed For:
			- more of an artefact that captured the insights and learning
			- spent lots of time re-introducing concept to new people. how to have onboarding
			- More time!
			- Clear defined goals for each phase of the journey. I longed to know what milestones we were working towards ... sometimes it felt like the goal was fuzzy and I still do not know if we have “achieved” what we set out to do.
			- A minimalist, clear approach to accessing info. It felt like there were instances of information asymmetry and this might have come in the way of sustained collaboration.
