# DAO Primitives Meeting - 14/03/23

- Prep for posting proposal on snapshot
	- Setting up the snapshot - founder badge 
	- Get their addresses if they don't have a badge and pass to Ananth
	- Proposal - fist to five on using snapshot (Rowan)
- Next steps on cell primitive and cell of cells 
	- Cells will store their cell state in the DOA State repository 
	- To update this they will push a change request to the DAO state admins - each cell will have a person with Gitbook editor status. That way they can make the changes to their own Cell state
	- This will require some from the gov team to review the DAO state changes weekly to make sure that the changes are all okay.
- Plan for Gitcoin Allo stack and partnerships cell
	- Allo is expected to be live in April 
	- We are going to look to partner with Shanny on the gitcoin side of the first grants round
