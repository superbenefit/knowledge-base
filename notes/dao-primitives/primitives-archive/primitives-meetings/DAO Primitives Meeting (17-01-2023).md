# DAO Primitives Meeting - **17/01/23**

- Review timeline items - discuss, more to add? 
- Review Financial and Governance diagrams
- Discuss initial financial rewarding and governance mechanism
- Review Badging design
- Tasks to get to completion for:
	1. Github/gitbook state
		- Guides in Clarity - only editable by the Gov team
		- Rather hoping to have it done by Tuesday next week for feedback
		- Proposals, policy questions, rules for updating gov state - still needed
		- Guide with outline of CELL nucleus for working groups list (Rowan to add a guide to the CELL gov state to add to gitbook)
	2. Governance badging
		- @Ananth to create org, create badges, collet wallet addresses 
		- @Ananth will own the Badger org to start - with the intent of switching this to being an AIFS multisig. In the interim we will set up a fresh wallet and wrap this in some badging to give the Gov team access to the seed phrase to the wallet. 
	3. Proposal set up - discourse, snapshot
		- We will need an ENS - for snapshot
		- Set up the same wallet as for badger and set this up with ENZ for snapshot 
		- Hosting for discourse - @Ananth to figure out costs
			- We will need a credit card 
			- @Rowan  Rowan to have a chat with Shanny and Lewwwk about how to pay for things like Discourse - possibly use a crypto debit card 
		- Operational governance could go 100% through moloch - with badging on the governance layer
	4. Reward mechanism
		- We can use badger to give people vouchers - that they can redeem later - 
		- @rathermercurial@Ananth@Rowan  Set up a moloch and do some testing. On a screenshare.
	5. Sobol
		- We will hold off on this until we have more cells
	6. Multi-sigs
		- @Ananth to create the mainnet multisig and polygon - Ananth will go on as a signer and we will figure out who is going on the multisig following this. 
	7. UNA wrapper
		- Have a chat though the above with @Lewwwk and then decide on when to do this plus what entities to include etc. 
			- Use the operating agreement that's hosted on github. No official status but can get started
			- Then we can do the official processing of the UNA
			- Dellaware likely best option
			- May as well do this straight away
			- Then go to Endowment about becoming a fiscal sponsor - question do they need the official entity status. 
			- Let's put together the operating agreement and then do the UNA asap. 
- Dates added to timeline items
- Tasks set up in Clarity
