	- Interest around using Hypercerts
		- We should do more POAPs
		- Attesting to impact that is being created. Create a scope of impact and reward people with NFTs around who is creating the impact 
		- Facilitate follow on funding by directing people to fund the hypercert ( [https://hypercerts.org/](https://hypercerts.org/) )
	- Shanny is creating a statement describing AIFS <> KH relationship. Combined with Cell state, this could be a good basis for formalizing partner relationship 

## Decisions
Decision - Allocate 20k SPRB to Ananth and rather, 10K to Rowan, 3k To Heenal and reserve 2k to allocate to other historical contributors to the project.
