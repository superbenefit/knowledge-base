# Meeting Agenda

## Updates

-  checked in with GC re: Charmverse proposals. No objection to replicating the proposal workflow in Charmverse and using Discord mostly for proposal stage announcements.

-  checked in with treasury squad (Lewwwk) re: multisig management and surfacing all contracts/EOA's used by superbenefit. Open to redeploying safes if needed. Multichain portfolio (ie Zapper, etc.) desired.

- Reimagining Power needs Proposal db view & instructions (similar to tasks/IKC)

  - [https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/charmverse-proposal-workflow-setup-9453982362360167](https://app.charmverse.io/superbenefit/charmverse-proposal-workflow-setup-9453982362360167)

### Last Week's To-Do's

- [x] Rather will create follow-up email content for sessions

Stakeholder signups tagged and newsletter content drafted with ChatGPT; Ready to be edited and recording added after stakeholder session

- [ ] Rather will create Luma messaging for community sessions (still to-do)

Will add this content after confirming dates and setting up Community sessions in Discord (cleaner UI that way)

## Discussion Items

- (Updates) Bungie issues

- (Rowan) Check that everything is ready to go for first sessions:

  - Check timing for stakeholder and community meetings

  - Confirm instructions to go into engagement slide for WP presentation [https://app.pitch.com/app/presentation/f453ad33-ddfd-4e98-b245-342560b1190c/557b1ff7-9c53-4679-bfb3-524abd432d89/daf7c050-24fd-4963-a77a-9c31c193d471](https://app.pitch.com/app/presentation/f453ad33-ddfd-4e98-b245-342560b1190c/557b1ff7-9c53-4679-bfb3-524abd432d89/daf7c050-24fd-4963-a77a-9c31c193d471)

    - From here you don't have to do anything - email will do fin

    - If you would like to engage in conversation - join the discord - the stakeholder channel is private and they need permission to access it

      - If they don't have a wallet they can get a 90day guest pass

      - If they have a wallet they can receive a hat that gives them access 

      - We can talk them through, getting a wallet and then joining the discord joining process.  Fill out this form and we will set up an onboarding session. 

      - Or they can do a self service if they are proficient in web3. Provide them the links to do this. 

    - Invite them to join the community - this happens automatically when they join the discord - outline the community engagement overtime - jump into the chat/conversations in discord (future innovations etc) tokens (sourcecred), web3 governance, community quests etc.  

  - Timing and outreach for blogpost 

    - 

  - Outreach to Community

  - Gitbook

  - SourceCred walk through

- Anything to discuss from updates?

  - proposals, treasury, etc

- (Rowan) Review where the DAO primitives are at and plan next steps
