	- Re: States, PM/IM & Documentation:
		- How to move from "**There should be _xyz_ resource**" (relying on support staff to create something for me) to a culture of responsibility for clarifying our shared truth and understanding.
		- How to address coordination-scale ambivalence around norms, tooling, information-sharing, role clarity, etc.
			- Have a gov cell contributor attend CELL meetings to take notes & facilitate around cultural norms and CELL state development.
		- How to address ambivalence and/or lack of clarity around Membership Rules, CoC, Dispute Resolution and other "Soft Governance" topics.
			- Importance of creating a sensing & communication mechanism for calling out governance <-> operational divergence within comms
			- Facilitate conversations around social norms
			- hosting onboarding / navigating sessions
			- more humans needed in community experience
			- Incentives needed to further allocate time / coordination
		- Thanks to Michelle and Heenal for contributing to this discussion.
