[The Eightfold Path to DAOism
](https://orca.mirror.xyz/WVB26-PtNp8D_7A7DXNPhnOMEHnPrEP2NgJc0nRAqwo)
- Automation at the Center, Humans at the Edges
	- There are some tasks that a protocol cannot perform on its own. It will require a human user to feed it inputs, within the bounds of the protocol’s automated rules—humans at the edges. Where humans are required to click on buttons, governance becomes relevant. After all, which human gets to click on the buttons? These humans at the edges must deal with the jurisdictions and the relevant regulations.
- Open Source and Blockchain-Based
	- The infrastructure and tools should be composable with other tools in the DAO’s ecosystem to have staying power.
- Independent Parties
	- Participants in a DAO can work independently on projects that they think will bring the most value to the protocol.
- Internal Capital
	- In exchange for their contributions, participants are rewarded with the protocol’s token. There is a clear incentive to commit time and effort to working for the protocol.
- Governance
	- The governance function of the token promotes long-term value and growth. It gives token holders the power to change the rules of the system when necessary and allocate the resources of the ecosystem through a decision making process.
- Enable a Bottom-Up Structure
	- Bottom-Up does not mean leaderless. In fact, the system could be organized with a combination of bottom-up, modular and top-down processes—which is precisely what Orca Protocol enables. This does not rule out the inclusion of top-down design. Actually, it is an essential part of intention-setting within the community. Founders can share their vision of what the protocol can become, and entice and inspire the community to follow that vision. This initial vision is key for the development of fundamental infrastructure, which then drives the emergence of bottom-up participation from individuals.
- Membership is Open
	- Participating and contributing in a DAO is open and not limited to a select group of people. Mission critical aspects of the DAO, such as the main treasury, are not accessible to everyone but anyone could support or reject proposals, or write a proposal themselves.
- Collusion is A Bug
	- In a truly decentralized system, the common behavior of independent participants is to work for their own interests and profit instead of for a collective profit. This doesn’t mean that there are no collective values and missions that form a community. It just means that there is no common enterprise like in a traditional company.











[Pods: The DAOnfall of Token Voting](https://orca.mirror.xyz/Y2xvPmB4cJH51srGqY6Mm_g38lV-7cwvtyDePnyzfAE)
- What is Governance?
	- Governance is simply a tool an organization uses to decide where power should reside and who gets to click on what button.
	- Roughly defined, the ideal governance model is one that maximizes _meaningful __participation _and the organization’s _efficacy_.
- DAO Extremism
	- The unfortunate reality of DAO scaling is that it is very difficult to maintain a high degree of participation. As fewer people are willing to participate in the DAO’s coordination and governance, the higher the risk of centralized power. DAOs could integrate coordination tools, but the tool that works well for a DAO of 50 people might be very counterproductive for a DAO of 50,000 people, and vice versa.
- Token Troubles
	- gives rise to inequalities and incentive misalignment even in the absence of attackers. As mentioned earlier, whales can greatly influence the outcome of a vote, because small bag holders have an insignificant impact on the outcome.
	- even if participation rates were 100%, the outcome would only be representative of the wishes of token holders. 
	- Token voting is inherently at the expense of the interests of non-token holding stakeholders. 
	- can be attacked through various forms of vote buying. This is especially true if the governance token combines voting rights with some kind of economic interest in the protocol’s revenue; it is tempting for small holders to lend out governance tokens as their individual vote will not weigh heavily on the outcome.
	- Tools should be shaped to the needs of the DAO, so that it can best empower its community members to take ownership of their actions.
- The Answer: Pods
	- Pods are small working groups, usually centered around one expertise. In place of—or in addition to—one massive, centralized DAO treasury, each pod has its own multi-sig wallet that is controlled by the pod members.
	- Pods are flexible, malleable and modular. They can exist as neighbors, embed or be embedded in other pods, split, merge, etc.
	- To gain membership to a pod, the claimant must meet a set of rules. These restrictions can be almost anything and should be formed around the gravity of the pod’s responsibilities. Membership can also be slashed at any time if the member fails to comply with membership rules. In other words, pods can grow, shrink and extend to the needs of the DAO.
- Member-Based DAO
	- Instead of the DAO’s governance centering around token-based voting, actions are now governed through pod membership.
	- pod memberships will not make governance tokens disappear, nor take away their power; instead, some of its powers are delegated to pods to make governance more efficient and flexible to the needs of the specific protocol in question.
	- Once in a pod, these decision making processes only have to be as involved as they need to be. Some decisions can be made through simple verbal agreements, while others may require an approval process.
	- A DAO of one pod can easily add another pod when it becomes large enough, and it can continue to add pods as it grows. Any hierarchies that form in this process are localized, deliberate and impermanent. The DAO just grows organically from day one.

[Scaling Trust in DAOs: Trustware vs Socialware](https://orca.mirror.xyz/T70CmuhX95ubkw_JHOxSEy8d_EFeYXgtJnF13mPtaZE)
- Socialware in DAOs
	- Much of the organizational structure and governance in most DAOs exist at the social layer. Through codified documentation and processes that live on Notion and Discourse, we set rules about quorum, term limits, voting thresholds, etc then proceed to vote on Snapshot, and rely on a multisig to execute the terms of the snapshot vote as per the rules we set.
	- Although we had systemized our rules, we still relied heavily on human coordination. These rules only_mattered _if we had the awareness to follow them. And because humans are prone to error and forgetfulness, there were many times we did not abide by our own standards.
- Trustware in DAOs
	- Trustware in DAOs means bringing rules on-chain. Using blockchain and smart contracts, rules defined at the social layer can be brought on-chain and enforced without reliance on human coordination.
	- different from simply digitization. Digitization takes something analog and makes it digital, including all sorts of redundant human tasks. Trustware is a subset of digitization that focuses specifically on trust agreements that incur a social cost through coordination. 
- Trustware as a Spectrum
	- One important caveat to note is that trustware and socialware exist on a spectrum. The definitions above are relative to one another, they are not absolute.
- Balancing Trustware & Socialware
	- Trustware is not the end-all-be-all for DAOs. DAOs are inherently human organizations that will require systems that adapt to how humans relate and behave, not robots. But successful DAOs will have a combination of socialware and trustware, each with its own healthy balance depending on the needs of the DAOs.

[The Bull Case for Pods](https://orca.mirror.xyz/dpNi9dL-ARddwhFYvBrQfM-SVoNyZkzQgA_KLaHZZ78)
- **The atomic unit of a DAO isn’t people or projects – it’s small groups of people working together.**
- DAOs are groups of humans coordinating together to solve problems.
- We see this through the emergence of workstreams, working groups, guilds, or whatever else you choose to call the small teams that make up almost every DAO.
- Pods 101
	- pods are a lightweight permissions layer around a Gnosis Safe multi-sig wallet, used to create more flexible and composable working units. Access to a pod is authorized through membership NFTs. 
- Benefits of Pods
	- **1) Give the right people the right type of autonomy**
		- Pods give autonomy to the most fundamental unit of work happening in DAOs – groups of people focused on directed tasks.
		- Autonomy in this context could mean control of funds, governing rights, or even smart contract permissions.
		- Pods need autonomy to operate, otherwise, they risk getting stuck in a bureaucratic maze asking for permission to perform even the most basic tasks.
	- **2) Create flexible, on-chain structures**
		- Pods give DAOs the benefits of being on-chain, while also creating incredibly modular structures that can be shaped, shifted, and re-imagined without breaking the entire system.
	- **3) Make your DAO consumable by people and tools**
		- Because pods are on-chain and membership is granted via an NFT, they are consumable by any tool that reads on-chain data. For example, DAO tools can simply read pod structures and relationships to do things like map an organization, identify key members, understand token streams, and more. Pod consumption also applies to web3 social networks, defi protocols, and other products that leverage relational graphs of addresses.
	- **4) People come and go, but pods are forever**
		- it shouldn’t matter who comes and goes – the organization is still the organization. Pods make this true on-chain.
		- People come and go, pods are the container that lasts.

[Juicebox has been deployed](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/juicebox-deployed)
- Juicebox is a business-model-as-a-service and programmable treasury for community-owned Ethereum projects.
- The Juicebox protocol does this by allowing projects to make commitments about how its cashflow will be distributed _before _ever receiving payments, signaling to users how their money will be spent ahead of time_._
- It works really well as a payment terminal and programmable treasury for projects that have mostly predictable costs (like staff payouts, service subscriptions, donations, budgeted initiatives, etc.), and who want to automatically reward their community as they become successful.

[Is Juicebox for Whales 🐋? Apes 🦧? Punks 👾? Creators 🎨? Devs ⌨️? Every Etherean 🇪🇹?](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/is-juicebox-for-whales)
- The Juicebox protocol is meant to support small projects with big ambitions, alongside large projects that want to involve their day-to-day users/community in its growth efforts and outcomes.
- Meanwhile, it's meant to give patrons and investors of various risk profiles confidence over their spending and their financial positions.
- The answer is to just stick money in the protocol for the specific project. The system works the same for everyone.

[Juicebox Observations 8/3/2021](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/juicebox-observations-8-3-2021/)
- **Juicebox is flexible. **The protocol has the capacity to power several project operation styles. This is great, but can also be overwhelming to project owners exploring their options. It's very helpful for founders and communities to have a Juicebox "expert" that can help them translate their needs into a Juicebox config, along with a catalogue showcasing several examples of how their project might behave given certain choices.
- **Juicebox projects can be very much "alive".** Instead of baking in a token distribution schedule ahead of time, communities using Juicebox are given the freedom to experiment and refine their strategy together over time (they could also lock it in forever from the start if they want). 
- **Juicebox works really well for communities who build products.** There is no better way to fund a treasury than by piping in revenue from direct sales made off-site.
