# Playbooks Directory: Actionable Guides for Organizational Success

This directory contains in-progress work on playbooksâ€”actionable guides that combine organizational patterns and primitives into comprehensive, practical resources.  Playbooks are designed to help individuals and organizations implement effective strategies and solutions for various challenges.


## What is a Playbook?

A playbook is a living document that provides step-by-step guidance for achieving specific organizational goals.  Unlike static documentation, playbooks are designed to evolve and adapt as organizations learn and grow.  They bring together technical details, governance frameworks, and community insights into clear, actionable steps.


### Playbook Structure and Content

Each playbook in this directory follows a consistent structure, typically including:

* **Introduction:** An overview of the playbook's purpose, scope, and intended audience.
* **Key Concepts:**  Definitions of important terms and concepts.
* **Step-by-Step Guide:**  A detailed, sequential guide to implementing the strategy or solution.
* **Implementation Details:**  Technical specifications, code examples, or other relevant information.
* **Case Studies:**  Real-world examples of how the playbook has been successfully applied.
* **Community Input:**  Feedback and contributions from the community.
* **Appendix:**  Additional resources, templates, or supplementary materials.

### Querying Playbooks

Playbooks can be queried in a dataview query like this:
```
LIST description
WHERE 
    type AND
    (
        contains(type, "playbook") OR
        (type = "playbook")
    ) AND
    !contains(file.path, "tools/") AND
    !contains(file.path, "drafts/")
```

An example of this pattern in a dataviewjs query would be:
```
dv.list(
    dv.pages()
        .where(p => 
            (Array.isArray(p.type) 
                ? p.type.some(t => t.includes("playbook")) 
                : p.type?.includes("playbook")) &&
            !p.file.path.includes("tools/") &&
            !p.file.path.includes("drafts/")
        )
        .map(p => p.file.name)
);
```

%% Here is the bare query for fileclass field values:
```javascript
dv.pages()
    .where(p => 
        (Array.isArray(p.type) ? p.type.some(t => t.includes("playbook")) : p.type?.includes("playbook")) &&
        !p.file.path.includes("tools/") &&
        !p.file.path.includes("drafts/")
    )
    .map(p => p.file.name);
```
