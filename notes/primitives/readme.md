# Primitives Directory

This directory documents the basic building blocks of DAO organization. If patterns are like recipes and playbooks are like cookbooks, primitives are the core ingredients - the fundamental elements that make everything else possible.

## What's a Primitive?

A primitive could be:
- A basic governance mechanism like multi-sig voting
- A core operational function like role management  
- A foundational organizational structure like working groups
- A basic coordination tool like task tracking

The key is that primitives are simple, foundational elements that can be combined in different ways to solve organizational challenges.

## Directory Structure 

Our DAO primitive documentation is organized in three layers:

1. Core Concepts - Foundational building blocks of DAO organization
2. Framework - Tools for understanding context and application
   - Phase - Group development stages
   - Scale - Organizational scaling models
   - State - Group properties and transitions
3. Patterns - Proven combinations that solve common problems

Each layer builds on the previous - from basic elements to tested combinations to contextual guidance.

## Working With Primitives 

Start in `/drafts/` when documenting a new primitive. Focus on these key questions:
- What specific problem does this primitive solve?
- How does it work in its simplest form?
- What other primitives does it commonly combine with?
- Where has it been used successfully?

For example: Role rotation mechanics combined with weighted voting enables decentralized team coordination. The framework helps understand when these combinations make sense for your organization.
