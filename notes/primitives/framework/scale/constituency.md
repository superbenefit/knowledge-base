The Constituency Scale represents a broad-based level of group organization, encompassing a large and diverse group of stakeholders who share a common interest or benefit from the organization's activities.  

Unlike the Collaboration and Coordination Scales, which focus on smaller, more tightly coupled groups, the Constituency Scale emphasizes participation, representation, and collective decision-making across a wider community.  This scale is often necessary when decisions need to be made that affect a large and diverse population, requiring mechanisms for ensuring that the voices of all stakeholders are heard and considered.
