**Group Scale** is a [group property](tags/groups/index.md#^6009b0) referring to the relative size of an group's active membership, and is an important factor in the selection of [primitives](tags/primitives.md). ^624978

Human groups function in fundamentally different ways at different scales. When we design systems for groups to work together. The scale at which this happens is critical to how a particular group pattern will function.

Any frameworks we draw from to design human systems needs to account for scale to have any chance of success.Â

We use the above group scale model to inform how we combine the different primitives. It is based on modern organisational/anthropological models but very simplified to be easy to apply. It maps 3 basic group scales:

- **[Collaboration Scale](tags/groups/scale/Collaboration%20Scale.md)**
- **[Coordination Scale](tags/groups/scale/Coordination%20Scale.md)**
- **[Constituency Scale](tags/groups/scale/Constituency%20Scale.md)**

> [!NOTE]
> _It is important to note the size listed for the different scales is an upper limit but not a lower limit. For example, trying to collaborate at numbers greater than 10 is generally impossible, however it is possible for a small team of less than 10 people to operate in coordination or constituency scale governance structures._
