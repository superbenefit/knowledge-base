This framework organizes the foundational concepts used in [[tags/daos|DAO]] design and operation. It serves as a practical guide for understanding how these components interact within decentralized organizations.

## Key Concepts

Many concepts are used in relation to *primitives*, and the specific qualities which define a primitive may shift from one situation to another. In the context of DAO primitives, we're referring to the social practices, software modules and coordination protocols used in the design and implementation of platforms for purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams.

Since interacting with DAO Primitives can require us to navigate information-dense realms full of abstract memes and contextually-shifting jargon, it can be helpful to familiarize ourselves with some basic concepts, and how they can relate to one another in useful ways.

Below is a practical framework for using these concepts to inform our approach to DAO Primitives. You'll see these terms come up a lot in this realm, so here's one way to make sense of them. 

### Entities

Organizations [[tags/governance|govern]] and use [[tags/resources]] to [[power|empower]] agents to take action in 

*For practical purposes, these concepts are loosely organized in alignment with the [REA ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources%2C_Events%2C_Agents) for information systems. It's not that important, so feel free to remix them however you like.*

#### Resources
Resources form the foundation of all DAO operations, encompassing both tangible and intangible assets that can be managed and exchanged within the network. [[tags/resources]] are collectively managed through decentralized networks to achieve shared objectives.

[[Platforms]] create the underlying structure that enables DAO operations, combining technical and organizational frameworks to facilitate coordination:

* **Digital & Organizational Infrastructure**
    * Technical systems, Collaboration tools, Resource management
    * Governance structures, Operational processes, Cultural systems

The basic building blocks of DAO systems include:

* **Social [[Practices]] & Technical [[Protocols]]**
    * Community norms, Collaboration methods, Cultural patterns
    * Governance mechanisms, Resource allocation, Access control
* **Operational [[Modules]]**
    * Task management, Role definition, Value distribution
* **[[Policies]] & [[Permissions]]**
    * Operating procedures, Guidelines, Risk frameworks
    * Access rights, Role authorities, Resource controls

#### Actions
[[Actions]] represent all activities that create change within the DAO ecosystem. They range from simple transactions to complex governance decisions and are characterized by measurable outcomes, defined triggers, and clear ownership.

DAO actions include:
* **Core Operations**
    * Resource allocation, Task execution, Decision-making
* **[[Agreements]] & [[Transactions]]**
    * Explicit contracts, Network protocols, Value exchanges
    * Resource transfers, Information flows

#### Agents
[[Agents]] are the active participants who initiate and execute actions in the DAO ecosystem. They operate with specific capabilities and responsibilities that define their role in the network:

* **Individual & Collective Agents**
    * Community members, Contributors, Stakeholders
    * Working groups, Sub-DAOs, Partner networks
* **Automated Agents**
    * Smart contracts, Service bots, Oracle networks

Each agent type maintains:
* Decision rights and resource access
* Role assignments and accountability
* Performance tracking and outcome delivery

## Group Facilitation


### Group Properties

- **[Group Phase](notes/primitives/framework/phase/phase.md)**
  - [Conversation Phase](notes/primitives/framework/phase/conversation.md)
  - [Coordination Phase](notes/primitives/framework/phase/coordination.md)
  - [Formation Phase](notes/primitives/framework/phase/formation.md)
  - [Organization Phase](notes/primitives/framework/phase/organization.md)
- **[Group Scale](notes/primitives/framework/scale/scale.md)**
  - [Collaboration Scale](notes/primitives/framework/scale/collaboration.md)
  - [Constituency Scale](notes/primitives/framework/scale/constituency.md)
  - [Coordination Scale](notes/primitives/framework/scale/coordination.md)
  - [Network Scale](notes/primitives/framework/scale/network.md)
- [Group State](notes/primitives/framework/state.md)

## Integration Patterns
[[notes/primitives/patterns/patterns|Integration Patterns]] describe how these components work together to create cohesive, functional systems. The framework enables:

* **Structural & Operational Integration**
    * Nested hierarchies and network relationships
    * Workflow processes and decision pathways
    * Resource flows and communication channels
* **Implementation Objectives**
    * Progressive decentralization with coordination
    * Scalable operations with resource efficiency
    * Adaptive governance with clear boundaries

It's a good idea to work with your organization or community to select a pattern they'd like to follow at first.. But it can be hard to consider a broad range of complex possibilities with a large group. One important step in pattern selection is to narrow the selection to just the most relevant options before presenting them to the community.

We recommend following the [[notes/primitives/framework/group-facilitation|Group Facilitation Framework]] to identify the patterns, practices and primitives which might be relevant to your project.
