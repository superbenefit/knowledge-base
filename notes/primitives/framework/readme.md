# Framework Directory

This directory contains our conceptual framework for understanding how DAO primitives and patterns operate at different phases and scales of organization. While `framework.md` provides the theoretical model, this directory houses the practical documentation of how groups evolve and scale.

## Directory Focus

The framework helps answer critical questions about DAO organization:
- What phase is your group in? (conversation, coordination, formation, organization)
- What scale are you operating at? (collaboration, constituency, coordination, network)  
- How do these factors affect which primitives and patterns will be most useful?

## Directory Structure

- `/phase/` - Documentation of group development stages
- `/scale/` - Analysis of different organizational scales
- `state.md` - Understanding group conditions and transitions
- `group-facilitation.md` - Practical guidance for group development

We use this framework to help groups:
1. Identify their current phase and scale
2. Select appropriate primitives and patterns
3. Plan for growth and transitions
4. Maintain effective coordination as they evolve

## Practical Application

Think of this framework as a map - it helps you:
- Diagnose where your group is now
- Identify what tools and approaches fit your context
- Plan for upcoming transitions
- Avoid common pitfalls at each stage

For example, a group in the conversation phase at collaboration scale needs different primitives than one in the organization phase at network scale. This framework helps make those distinctions clear.

See `/tools/types/` for documentation standards when contributing to framework materials.
