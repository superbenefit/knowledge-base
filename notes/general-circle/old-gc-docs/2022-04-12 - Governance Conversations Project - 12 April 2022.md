## Questions
- Roles
	1. Alex help with facilitation & hosting, as well as scoping/designing. Can give more time if there is cross-over.
- How do we curate? What are the underlying frameworks... Ensuring that the conversations are different but complementary

## Themes
- Metagovernance
	- cutting edge digital native metagovernance (tokenized - gabagool, redacted, etc)
	- older models - indigenous perspectives, co-operatives, collective impact etc - how humans trying to hold and distribute power among people and environment-hybrid of two (samantha slade?)
	- hybrid between the two (SuperBenefit) - and how are we seeing some of what is emerging in web3 be useful to old and new world e.g. Indy Johar, Dark Matter Labs [https://radiclecivics.cc/](https://radiclecivics.cc/) 
- Other Notes
	- how create conditions for cross-sector multiple actors, some coherence around what is important to shift - (like collective impact) - no one has come up with a way for this to happen - but could put in metagovernance structure
- Possible Q's 
	- How is the notion of governance changing or being remembered at this time, and why? ("where are we...")
	- How do we design governance for a more pluralistic world and positive systems change? ("what might we...")
	- How might we think about and design governance for the current time and better futures?

Notes from @Lewwwk - fwiw the first set of questions feel like a series of toc aligned conversations that would be of interest to those interested in changing/making systems and the role and nature of governance. the latter feel like a set of panels/content that web3xsocial impact and Transition Innovation Groups audiences would want to attend/read/listen to - makes me think of a content series.
## Next Actions
- meeting schedule
- discord channel
- miro board

## Next meeting
- narrow down the scope - What's the key enquiry/framing?
	- one paragraph across all 3 spaces
	- specific questions for each space
- ready to invite people in?

## Framing
- Decentralized, pluralistic, regenerative structures
- Ecological framing
- Maybe new/old/in the middle is not the right way of thinking about it
- We know the kinds of things we want to cover, just need to craft the invitation...
- ⬜️ SUP-238 Craft v1 invitation + guiding questions (for panel + audience) 
- First conversation maybe 4-6 weeks from now. 2-3 weeks notice is sufficient. Got to get the framing right and attract the right people. 7 pm EST = 9 am Queensland
