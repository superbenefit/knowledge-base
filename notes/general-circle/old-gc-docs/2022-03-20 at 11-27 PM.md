Session @Lewwwk @heenal @MBaldwin @AlexH @Rowan   
1: Mapping pathways to the future. 

The goal of this conversation is to lay this out at a high level to inform the next round of conversations that Mike is having with players in the ecosystem. And get us organised around who is going to do what as we kick this project off.

Current work-streams to consider:
1. Michael's ongoing conversations with ecosystem players
	- @gabagooldoteth - $SUPERB - going to write a post around idea of having a metacurrency related to our t - that allows us to purchase up in stakes in core assets and other infrastructures (ethereum) on those protocols. How to interact it with real world governance? Initial index new to crypto instead of eth and bitcoin but more vaulable to participating in impact/ what are other things can do with pool of assets and invest with liquidity pools/lobbying and enabling gov't policy and encouraging a welcome receptive environment/governance mechanisms  - how to do in parallel in real world
	- [https://www.paladin.vote/](https://www.paladin.vote/)  - trend in defi, value in building mechanisms and infrastructure
	- layer on top of that - Dan Wu at Orca protocol - sub dao coordination tool  - [https://twitter.com/itsdanwu/status/1505528678465380355?s=20&t=Yb-ZwkQdToU9_RJxEqczJA](https://twitter.com/itsdanwu/status/1505528678465380355?s=20&t=Yb-ZwkQdToU9_RJxEqczJA)  - gets at how can we accelerate on governance innovation on governance mechanisms, web3 enables in ways have not had access to - if that is a focus point on a mini project - governance innovation and curating the approaches - is this something of value?
	- if we financialize governance, it will get gamed, because that's what financial systems do. if we want innovation in the space, what are the mechanisms for innovation? there is an openness to experimentation and the tools for it, so how do we engage with that. there tends to be a focus on mechanisms rather than on what underlies that. Now more conversations are happening around context, different types of hierarchy, appropriate levels for decisions. There's an opportunity to curate some of this material, get a sense of the landscape.
	- sense-making in its minimal form is us having conversations with people who are doing interesting things.
	- maybe we can host a series of conversations with people doing interesting things around governance in the old and the new world. with some kind of output capturing learnings. "who is doing the most interesting work in the field of governance? /  what is interesting you...?"
	- question of resourcing some of this work. could give us the capacity to do more research, even run simulation DAOs. we can use our existing treasury for experiments.
	- start with quick curation of existing governance conversations in the space to help us draw out the key questions, lines of inquiry, threads we want to pull. how do we run this process as a mini-flywheel? making the outputs more collaborative, speakers bringing in more speakers and more ideas, etc
	- what is the collective wisdom around governance in multiple contexts? and how can we bring that together
	- what is the appropriate format/platform for the conversations? how open would they be? many different formats would work.
	- ACTION: set up a scope of a budget for this project (whether we call it part of invitation1 or not) and allocate some $SPRB to it. A 2 month sprint or something. If we play the curation role it de-centers us from the work and builds our credibility
2. First map-making work with broader community
3. Metagovernance project - as extension of starting conversations Michael is having + rebel alliance/meta-currency 
4. OCAD U research project
	- could be post grad - capable and intrigued and linking their work to SuperBenefit, having their work frame it, see if links to their current project and other projects - systems innovation and systems mapping
	- that ecosystem of design talent in that program in particular and OCAD more broadly
	- would this fit with governance innovation? need to better understand the parameters of this project? might be interested in components of this project 
5. Metagovernance research project (discord) [https://discord.com/channels/874697948838101092/914988187317854289/954729451856478228](https://discord.com/channels/874697948838101092/914988187317854289/954729451856478228) 
6. Web3 inclusion conversations with CCS & others (Heenal & Michelle)
