Blockers
- Discord guild/channel refactor 
- Define roles we need (for survey)
- Contributor onboarding + tool access
- Need clarity/permission to CRM system + contributor database
- Not sure what SB’s public-facing comms are to look like. So we're not sure if we can organize and promote 

Tensions
- environmental lens and language is not showing up in mission, purpose, values, drawings, convos - was an aha this week and something for us to keep holding
