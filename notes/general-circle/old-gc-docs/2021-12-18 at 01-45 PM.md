# Start Here - Discord
Hi there! Welcome to SuperBenefit!
You are joining a group of curious people. We have a hunch that web3 may offer the means to create a better future, for all, for generations to come. We're creating this space to explore that potential together.
**What is SuperBenefit?**

SuperBenefit's purpose is to create a better future for all through new societal infrastructure and institutions built on web3 values, architectures and protocols. An equitable, sustainable, and abundant world is here for the making - if we choose it.
More than giving back or doing good, we are interested in opportunities to fundamentally reset how resources and authority flow through society, rewiring positive outcomes into the way things work. 
For us, success means flipping systems of scarcity into abundance, and breaking cycles of dependency into interdependence and self-determination. 
**How does this Discord work?**
This video from @Lewwwk explains what all the different channels are in Discord and how to use them. Take a look!

If you're new to Discord, we understand that there can be a bit of a learning curve. Please reach out to #help-desk with ANY questions that you might have! Or come join our virtual Welcome Party (see #upcoming-events) if you prefer to ask your questions "face to face" :)
**What do I do now?**
1. Please take a moment to introduce yourself in **👋-introductions**. We'd love to get to know you!
2. Once you've introduced yourself, take a moment to select the roles/gifts/interests you're bringing in **🖐-role-selection**. if you're not sure where you fit in yet, simply choose the "Not sure yet" role 🙂
3. Check out the latest #announcements and #upcoming-events
4. Dive into one of the Guild or Project channels and contribute to the conversation!
Whatever your journey is with us, we're glad you're here. Let's build a better future, together!
**Finally, be safe!**
Be careful out there! 
Scammers may try to impersonate official accounts in order to steal your information and money. Always be suspicious if you get a DM from an official-sounding account, as most admins/projects will only DM you if you DM them first.

**DO NOT TRUST, ALWAYS VERIFY. And, NEVER share your private key or sensitive information.** 

Fakers can be clever. Some even make fake scam copies of websites.

Thank you for joining us here on Discord. We're looking forward to getting to know you. On behalf of all of us here, welcome to SuperBenefit!

PS At the risk of more confusion (or hopefully clarity), here are a couple more resources that offer some snapshots of the thinking that's led us here. We are in process of coalescing our foundations now and getting to work, hence the transition chaos.
