design development #[nft-project](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/nft-project.md) #[78 Spec Ember NFT](78%20Spec%20Ember%20NFT) 
# Series 1 NFT - Project Brief
## Objective 
Launch our first [nft series](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/nft%20series.md) in order to:
1. Bootstrap the treasury
2. Provide a foundation for future engagement and NFT projects
3. Get into as many wallets as possible

## Design principles
- Build the SuperBenefit story
- Be as simple as possible
- It should be alive, responsive to how it is used
- Owners should feel it will bring them significant value over time
- Owners should feel attached to it (this is more important over time)

## **Lore**
It begins with a spark. A collision of energy between two entities. Illuminating the hidden connections that exist between us and the world around us. 
A lone spark may leave a mark but quickly burns out, a temporary signal of connection/interaction. 
A concentration of sparks though can creates fire - a catalyst for change in the environment around us. 
Each of our initial contributors are a spark - Individually each providing their small bit of energy, but when concentrated they all provide the energy needed to start our fire and help start turning the gears that drive SuperBenefits flywheels.  
The NFT Series 0 sparks provide a lasting representation of the early contributors to SuperBenefits success. 
Acquirers of the Series 0 will also automatically receive the Ember NFT, SuperBenefits Soul Token, when its ready to be released. This ember NFT will be the symbol used by all of our community to show their ongoing support and their contribution to keeping out fire burning. Each NFT will be equipped with features that change the NFT based on the owner's contributions to Superbenefit (Financial/Community) as well as other attributes TBD.    
## Features
- Core
	- "Ember Token": One per wallet max
		- encourage people to invest in one nft
	- NFT image represents a single node
	- NFT contains two contribution scores
		- Financial  'score' that is influenced by user actions
		- Action
	- Counter (token id)
	- Version
- Questions:
	- what can trigger score updates, and how does that happen?
	- how would we have image respond to scores (how does that get update)
	- do we need to capture a 'creation date' (or can that just be called as a property)
	- can we dynamically grab the total/avereage/top of each score across the collection
- Mint Site
	- Off-chain resources required at mint
		- Record of any existing financial and activity contributions by eth address
	- Connect wallet
	- Prepopulate scores based on address
	- Add eth
	- Mint
- **_"Feed the Tamagotchi"_**

## TBD
- Can we avoid needing a mint site? Most complicating features are
	- allowing people to put variable amounts into their nft
	- enabling token aware sharing
	- Mint site examples:
		- [https://cryptocoven.xyz/](https://cryptocoven.xyz/) 
		- [https://www.plantfriendtree.com/details](https://www.plantfriendtree.com/details) 
		- [https://mint.shinyobjects.gg](https://mint.shinyobjects.gg/) 
- Creating sense of potential future value or interest. Potential hooks:
	- Signal ohm fork ahead (careful not to position this as an investment with expectation for profit - flips it into a security)
	- Utility in voting to deploy the treasury, or access to other things in the future
	- Curiosity for what might be coming ahead. "What could this turn into?"
	- Desire to be part of something
- What is the art?
- Which chain?
- Which marketplace?
- Number of NFT's?
- Cost of NFT's? Low cost or free?

## For Future Series
- Network representations
- Different illustrations
- Different interactions (prompts)
- Proposals for other representations and uses of the nftt

# Session Notes (RAW)
Initial concept (soul token - that can connect with others)
- they are useless unless they are used
- just a pixel (could have other visuals
- offering abundance, not rarity
- initial parameters
	- mint date
	- mint sequence (counter from 0) 
	- score: love/hope/wagmi/power/peace/awareness/intent/health
		- contribution (eth paid) first incrementing
		- 'interactions' (could be proposals we accept - like nouns)
			- sharing with others (the link that invites others to mint)
- first campaign - representations of individuals nodes
	- could start as a flame... evolving over time
		- lighter
		- hope
		- spark
	- could have game mechanism
		- fire intensity could be based on action (or inaction)
		- could have movement
		- could have sound
	- behaviour we would want to incentivize?
		- the idea of being able to track your attention to it - could it be an object of **meditation**
		- sharing
		- sharing the project (viral mechanics)
		- could be global mapping
		- "connect"
		- taking people on a journey... 
		- what if everybody is contributing to the nft
			- prompts, comments,
			- sounds, art
			- breath, heartbeats 
			- earth/water 
	- what do we need for this to be successful
		- connect - with another holder (site that invites a prompt on the future)
			- establishing connections between nodes
				- wallet address 
					- transaction histories (a list of related addresses)
					- what else in a wallet
						- other memerships
						- tokens (coins and nfts)
				- nft history
					- experience interactions (e.g. respond to prompts, participate in events, etc.)
					- 
		- interact
			- 'pro-human' interactions (communities of place, interest, value)
			- hive mind
			- seeding collective conciosness, intelligence
			- this is another form of social infrastructure
		- 
- bridging between campaigns
	- actions that could be encourage to link nodes in some way
		- sharing with others
		- lighting your fire needs to connect or do an acti
- second campaign - collections of nodes (these are the connection series)
	- could evolve imagery from broken/burning to flourishing/forming
	- interactions with other projects/tokens held
	- network (bias perspective) -> potentiality, forward looking, not backward looking
		- network
		- inheritance
		- access
	- transactions going through chain become the pulses/synapses
	- could be targetted engagements
		- could be based on actions taken
	- how could interactions with projects actually reflect impact

Questions and thoughts
- what's the spectrum between intangible and tangible?
	- what's the first move or a followon
	- layers of engagement and interact
	- how do instrument actions or impacts


REACTION TO THE NOTES, HAVING MISSED THE CONVERSATION (by @flashlight )
- Feels like we’re missing a strategy. What are the NFTs FOR? 
	- What is the primary goal of this first issue?
		- Build community vs build treasury vs build awareness
	- What is the primary goal for the second issue?
- Strongly feel the outward facing names of these things should be novel.
	- New era, new possibilities, new words
	- Believe a novel word invites mystery and creates an “in-group” of those in the know, which can be very powerful for building community 
	- Wary of cultural appropriation 
	- Wary of associations with games like WoW and Diablo
- Wary of complexity. Think of the success of Coven, Apes, Nouns, etc. 
	- Identify even over art projects

Notes Dec 15
- represent points of time in what is possible, tokens with actions connected to other projects 
- each address can only have one soul token - is it personal identity, behaviour is about underlying score about how you use it so will be best to invest in one token, value of your soul token help you boost what you get out of the community
- how do we change the value in what triggers this - could have process for proposals, super bonus points for jumping in and figuring things out - soul token is your APY, your personal stake and your financial stake to maximize your personal return and impact - one score allows for opportunities, don't need to have it all sorted, lots of collaborations possible
- how do we prepare for scale? what if goes? 
- Mark is working on governance implementation plan 
- NFT as a single score, in a single NFT makes it easier for scale 
- what if 10,000 people in our Discord in a month - yipppeee
- use miro for convos, for what is being built
- miro board of images, architecture board about how tokens work - what is happening in the system that is held in multiple minds
- Mark is good - secretary - is that captured, is there an action, where is that, that is not what we said we are going to do
- Impact - where is it? - common reference of impact is about direct measurable benefits to specific beneficiaries and what we are talking about a next order level of impact, societal infrastructure that changes underlying resource authority flows - behaviours, systems e.g. if investment fund only funds projects we won't get to social infrastructure and future, we will just replicate Rockefeller Foundation, building the infrastructure to reshape the world
- aspects of who is participating - equity, inclusion and accessibility and how to pay attention to these
- how do we help people understand the level of impact we are going after, for some of us, what problem needs solving, a group that can diagnose, tell stories, 
- ACTION: Community convo - about impact and what is it we are solving - invite the provocation, exploration of how things can be different, those in the social impact space know that - let's not get stuck in convo, let's not avoid the convo and let's just do it and show it
- strong sense of optimism - we are just not going to 
- etch a sketch that needs to shake it up
- engage young people - they don't have preconceived notions
- we are having to adapt to those who are not in web3 ecosystem so far, when web3 world 
- first experience needs to show initial social infrastructure - bringing people into this experience 
- Idea of having the first interaction into the intention part of it before we get into the technical part of web3, they can go at different rates, this what we are building and the learning journey is the doing in SB
- SeedClub App - Peter (video), Michael (DM some people), Michelle, Heenal, Peter, check with aussie friends (app)

NFT Token
- fractal 
- holon - is something that is simultaneously a whole in and of itself, as well as a part of a larger whole, - idea of super organism, holocracy and collective intelligence [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)) 
- reconcile our individual and collective self - soul token is the unit to explore that question
- superbenefit score creates emergence, and visual exploration as it grows and connects
- memes and culture - impact space - why do people do it - freedom - intent is vital to pointing in the direction of emergence
- how do we communicate to those who want 
- freedom and abundance, don't need to measure it - raw chaos exists, liberation to say we are fucked and be vulnerable and dream that we can pull this off - 
- the impact is inherent in the infrastructure, aliveness in the doing and the action, that is the impact  - visceral aliveness - breathe, pulse, so grounding and active energy 
- social change space embody and social presencing theatre - calligraphy, martial arts was at the ALIA Institute 
- I am here - I see you - I see us 
- I, you, we - it builds - other we - you token has to be gifted (enemy without benefits is playing with it, other) 
- other token
- I am -> we are -> I am because we are
- Governance Reward Token and NFT Token - SuperHero tokens - super nerdy, super queer, misfits of the world - needs 5 letters, could be a precursor to ohm fork.  #[$sprb](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/$sprb.md)  governance token and #[$superb](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/$superb.md) 

Notes Dec 28
- Sole token:
	- One per wallet limit (limited only to the number of wallets)
	- Signifier of the values/culture 
	- Two scores: Contribution (participation) value and the other financial benefactor (ETH) to bootstrap Treasury/DAO 
	- Subsequently: issue NFTs that award based on top contributors, driving incentives
- Initial Governance token pool (genesis phase)
	- 1/3 allocation pro-rata to financial benefactors
	- 1/3 contributors to date
	- 1/3 to Treasury
- Phase 2:
	- Ohm fork treasury token
- Mint site:
	- initiation of the story, close to the code, but easy for anyone to use
	- In the beginning there was...
	- Flywheels: the ecocycle, two wheels: from despair into hope, from hope into value
	- A mechanism to believe a better future into being
- Motivations:
	- I minted this NFT and it's a signifier of my belief in turning despair into optimism for a better future
	- I contributed my ETH to this thing because I believe this will become something of value and occupy an important space in the ecosystem
	- I contributed my effort because I am receiving something of value while building better
