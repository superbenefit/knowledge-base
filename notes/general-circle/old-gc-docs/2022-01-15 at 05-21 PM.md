#[web3 library](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/web3%20library.md) 
Thinking about refactoring the "themes" for the web3 library
- Currently we have "social change" and "impact". There is some overlap/it's not clear what should be in which theme and why
	- Maybe there should be something specific for "decolonize web3" or "anti-racism" or "making web3 inclusive"
- Currently the media "Directories" and "Learning DAOs & Courses" have no theme
	- Maybe "Directories" and "Learning DAOs & Courses" should be the theme and the media for those should be  "Website" or "Course"
