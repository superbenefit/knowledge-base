Lucas from Harvard Technology Review -  [https://t.me/lucas_chu](https://t.me/lucas_chu)  i’m writing an article about impact DAOs (e.g. “DAOs will save the world?”), then putting together a mailing list -> website of internships for students

**Purpose:**
To co-create a series of articles that capture the collective thinking and questions from the web3 & social impact elective participants.  Currently, there is a limited writing about web3 & social impact that reflects the possible futures and systems change that could disrupt existing institutions and create societal transformation. Further, social, cultural and environmental impact is in progress and how can we harness this further in web3 without replicating the harmful patterns of the past.

**Roles:**
Project Management
Writers
Editors
Promoters

- Post to Discords
- Post to Mirro
- Post to Harvard Technology Review
