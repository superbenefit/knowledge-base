#[[264 Systems Transformation Project]] 

### **June 20, 2023**
Attendees: Njoki Mburu, Susie Kavanagh, Rathermercurial, Primo Huang, Michelle Baldwin
Calls from web3 and Systems Transformation meeting today:
_Community treasure chest experiment_

Is there a way to experiment with a “community chest/group pot” for our tokens? Incase folks have different preferences for 

Just because people are getting retroactively funded in tokens doesn’t mean we should always be doing it that way. Just because folks get funded in tokens in their wallets doesn’t mean that it’s the only way.

We need to clarify on needs to ensure that our choice of funding is aligned. SPRB is funded for governance. 

**@keepDRMN**  is a big fan of non-asset backed classroom. Seeing a lot of DAOs doing things because others are doing it. How can we reward group effort rather than individuals?

As we continue to work, would we see use of these governance tokens that are more collectively managed and owned rather than individual wallets?

Suggestion: to keep it on the side as we wait for a potential way that it could be utilized. This is an experiment we can run and just see what comes of it. For example, when we have people coming in and out who haven’t necessarily done much for a retroactive earning, then this could be a pot of tokens that they could use for a one-off vote or project. There are many non-web3 people that would be amazing contributors (even if it’s a one time gig). The “outside” vote and voice could be really valuable contribution. 

Exploring other use cases of SPRB would be great! 

With the number of proposals going out, sometimes it’s hard to keep up but folks still want to have a voice. How about if we voted as a collective? Maybe if each of the folks in a group could read a part of a proposal and together they can come together and vote (using a delegation strategy). 

Next meeting discussion points suggested by **@rathermercurial** and **@keepDRMN**: 

1. Using tools to make tokens available to folks



1. Gated communities for folks to come and claim SPRB tokens while being fair to existing SB folks
2.

- Heenal, Rowan, Rather, Elena, keepDRMN
- Regrets: Michelle, Njoki
- ### Walk through on the community governance model from @rowan and other members of the governance cell.
	- traditional governance is clearly defined between "governance" and "management"
		- we are more concerned with how decisions are made, by whom, using what information 
	- "DAO" is such a generic term - could be simply a group chat with a bank account, or a multi-million dollar business. what's potentially good about DAOs?
		- The LLC somewhat democratized business ownership. Now we have even more tools...
		- How can we create structures to enable better decision-making, prevent capture, etc?
	- purpose driven networks of small autonomous teams coordinating in these new web3 ways
		- groups of different scales operate in different ways. we need to recognize the different dynamics.
	- "cell primitive"  - trying to create a generalized concept of a small autonomous team - a cell of 2-10 people
	- "cell state" = representation of the cell's structure, purpose, practice & progress
	- AIFS governance structure consists of two aspects: community governance (purpose-driven) + operational governance (small autonomous teams)
		- community governance is wrapped up in a UNA structure - this ensures participants are protected from liability
		- community governance approves the budget proposed by the cell of cells (generally optimistically) and can also, if needed, decide for the budget
		- main difference with trad model: the community has no financial stake in the commons but has full authority over the commons - this is guaranteed in the UNA

-curious related to transforming capital - are those with the decision making power related to capital, are they willing to step towards the web3 space and give up power, and how can we bridge their understanding and buy in to web3 models, what's the possible in between,
-how to change the perspective for those who hold the capital, how to introduce imagination-how to build momentum-if changing entity thinking what is replacing it - systems thinking, outcome thinking?
-how to build trust in this space both human and trust in systems and that it will truly be decentralized and that people will be responsible

web3 & Systems Transformation Weekly Check In
Tue, Apr 04, 2023 4:03PM • 1:00:55
**SUMMARY KEYWORDS**
people, governance, web, sport, work, super, bit, contribution, benefit, susie, thinking, coordinate, transformation, piece, happening, systems, lindsey, community, little bit, sdgs
 
00:00
put a call out as you could see to folks to say like who wants to come and talk about what we've all contributed and where we're going next. And I did hear from a few folks who were sad to not be able to make it. So Ash has a client meeting in Jocie is still in Kenya and this time doesn't work so well because it would be what midnight there. But I figure these things are emergent, and we start with who has come and we'll just see. Let's see if anybody else joins us. So the two things on the agenda is a bit around the the contribution and coordinate and all those kinds of things. And I think last week, we had different people here so I think it's kind of fun because we're good to get your input because we have been going around this a little bit Timo and I and some others and be fun to because I think if we can kind of put the the principles of equity and you know, values of web three into what we decide to do and even try to be a little bit what would you have a little discourse about it? I think it'll be interesting. And then focusing a little bit on like, how do we maybe wind down this phase or revolution and then get ready for what could be where else we could go with this web three and systems transformation work. So does that sound like a good agenda? Yeah, okay. Sounds good. Okay, so maybe like, maybe we can also do a couple updates on just a quick roundtable about what people are working on that relates to this topic, because I think we're all in spaces as I watch each of you. You know, people have blogs they're doing, what's Twitter spaces, they're doing presentations. They're doing so maybe I'll just do a quick check in with folks if that works. warm us up. Okay, Susie, do you want to kick us off?
 
01:58
I had a feeling you're an ask. I'm just laughing because I I literally reached into the fridge to pull out some vegetables to like start chopping them up. But I will go I don't translate. I'm coming up on vacation. So I don't really have too much of an update. I haven't I haven't chatted with jokey in a while since we had connected about she was kind of looking into like, what's an output that she could I don't wanna say deliver because I don't know what the expectations are with the work that she's doing with you, Michelle. But, so that's kind of, you know, she and I had kind of talked through some ideas and then I walked her through some potential ways that you could work on some prototypes and and it was all around Systems Transformation stuff, but not sure kind of like where we are with that or kind of where she potentially wants to take that. And I think it's also something that she can continue to work on for as long or as little as she wants to. So, you know, you know, past this time that she's working with you and you know, wherever else she's wanting to explore so and I have been wanting to get more involved in all in for sports, which is something I need to, you know, kind of chat offline. It's just, it's a little unclear. Like I've been kind of just checking out some of the governance stuff but it's a little unclear like, is the pathway to participation, like I know, there's like, I can't like feedback. Yeah, yeah. Like, I can't check in and be like, okay, like, here are the things like here's where they are right now, here's what they're working on. Here's where they could use some help or like, here's what they're you know, but I think if I recall correctly, maybe there's a Twitter space tomorrow. So looking forward to that.
 
03:57
And thank you for your suggestions and I think we've landed with a good panel I tried to get in on but and the busy Twitter spaces person but if you go to jump in to like keynote is going to do the same I hope just yeah, like I think it's I think it's dynamic when we can bring people up to the stage. So what about like you're, you're still just you're working or like helping to collaborate with radar as well. Which I away for the whole time that they that amazing session, or I guess whatever you'd call it journey is happening. So I just wonder, I think they're such good fit. Is there anything with your web three Thursdays or the radar stuff that you would weave into the systems transformation lens?
 
04:49
I think what they're doing is really interesting and like they're thinking about the future of futures work. And I think because he has such a global community, it's it's really, there's, it's, I think inherent in their DNA, it's like we colonized this work. But I but I really liked what they're doing. For this particular round. It's thinking about play, but but not just like, Let's go have fun. It's like, you know, how do we infuse play to everything that we do? And, you know, looking for signals of play, they've got some super interesting signals going on. And with regard to what you just mentioned, they are hosting a four session. I'm just calling it like a workshop for now. Each session is an hour and a half through April through middle of April, I think through May the first week of May. So it's like four different Wednesdays. I want to say it's like around $400, which for me is too high, but they also offer financial support, which I think is pretty amazing. And I think you know if if we are going to I think in any of this work, it's like whether it's governance or whether it's like, you know, just like all the work that we're doing it's I think, leaning more into Indigenous ways of knowing and values and and non western ways of thinking or doing just so critical. And, and trying to reframe a lot of work so, so thinking about things you've learned to play, I think is an interesting reframe. And so I've been basically anybody can be part of their community. I mean, you quote unquote apply to it. But then you just kind of jump in there discord, and there's I think they're one of the few communities that does a really good job, making it very clear. Kind of Here are ways to participate, but it's also because there's so much going on 24 hours a day can be extremely overwhelming. So if you miss a day, it feels like you're in this kind of like just what three but it does feel like you're missing a few weeks worth of stuff. But I think what they're doing is super interesting. And and I also I feel like I vaguely recall. I'm thinking about just initiatives to help move whatever it is that we want to do forward. I feel like I may have shared something a while back around to some grant funding. Maybe it was some collective intelligence they had they were looking to potentially partner with people when stuff
 
07:34
you did the Dow drops one and we did submit for Super benefit and all in for sport but weren't part of this round. But I Lindsey tipping has been in the waiting room Fruit of the Loom. I was off in a document. But so thank you, but yeah, anything you see like that? I don't know. I don't know if I saw collective intelligence but I didn't realize there was a funding round. Lindsay sorry if you were in the waiting room I was in. Welcome welcome.
 
08:00
Thanks. I'm not sure what up with wet hair but I'm here okay, well,
 
08:04
no problem. I had. We're here this morning and it's gone a bit wild after my walk this morning in the rain. So Susie, I don't know a few to have had a chance to meet. But Susie is giving us a bit of a check in about some of the things related to systems transformation that they're working on. And so maybe I'll let you just kind of finish that that thread up Susie and wherever you want to go, but maybe you can do an intro to
 
08:31
Yeah, hey. Hey, Lindsay and everybody. Yep. So I may have joined one of the sessions labor. I think Lindsay was participating. Oh, but, but I could be making it up.
 
08:42
No, I think you might be right. But yeah,
 
08:46
we're just going around just kind of updating people on what what we've been up to. And I'm just trying to think of there's I feel like there's one other ecosystem thread that I wanted to share with you all, but it'll come back to me and I'll drop it in the chat. Perfect.
 
09:01
And do you want to share what kinds of things you're up to or it may be in the chat even the link to the web three, Thursday's and all the amazing stuff you're doing? Sure we capture it in our notes. Sure, sure. I'll
 
09:12
drop something. Yeah, I
 
09:14
went to the one that you recently did on the gitcoin upcoming rounds, and it's super helpful for us for all in for sport. So thank you for that. Opportunity. Okay. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Maybe, Lindsey, I'll have you introduce yourself in the middle. Give you a minute to just get settled and I'll come to Heenal first, anything you're working on. You can even share maybe about the presentation we're doing tomorrow if you want.
 
09:40
Yeah, thanks. Yep, I'll start there. So shattered either in presentation tomorrow. There's trends from mainstream Innovation Group, which is a group that Michelle's been posting weekly for a while, and it's gonna be Yeah, it's gonna be talking about web three then put me across ballistas the web three you know how it relates to transformation space. And that's gonna be I'm looking kind of looking forward to it because as I haven't done a lot of that kind of talking to the web three about web three to two new audiences, but I think there's something exciting there and potential there and I'm going to be curious to see how people respond to that.
 
10:26
And maybe I can just jump in to see all are welcome. This is an open group that I've been kind of pulling together and being a backbone for for about two years now. And it's about reimagining infrastructures for societal transition from an equitable and social infrastructure focus. And the mostly Canadians but some folks from Europe and Australia, other places, so it's not a very good time sometimes for some people for PM, putting it in here. You're welcome to come. And I'm putting the link and if you come and you want to share 30 seconds about your web three experience or a minute we that'd be brilliant, but no pressure.
 
11:10
Yeah, cool. Okay, what else? So I haven't been doing as much I don't even know what I've been doing. Honestly. Just floating around and all in for sports. I guess I'm not putting too much into that but just there and so we're kind of moving along with that. And I know Susie, you'd asked about you wanting to jump in on that. So we can talk about that. Like now, I think to this call is as good a place as any to really talk about that and pathways to involvement. And that's actually something that came up I can't remember what the context was last week, whether it was in this call or something else, but might have been in the in the Olympic sport core. So I think I think I think there's something something for us to do generally and not just if you're experiencing that Susie, I'm sure other people would be as well have been more clear and explicit about the pathways for involvement and we haven't really put too much thoughts, thoughts but too much effort into it, I guess, just because of where it's at in its development. So So I think that is something just just a riff on that that you know, we have a discord there now, which is brand new. We haven't even got all of the all of the sport community over to the discord from previously those telegram which is still kind of happening concurrently. But there's definitely some work to be done on the experience in that discord of get just wayfinding in that and being clear how people get involved, what this is cetera. So I think there's some work to be done there. And yeah, so that then the Twitter space spaces tomorrow, which is going to be good when new doesn't doesn't website has been updated in the last week or so. And it's still it's not not perfect, but there's a video on there now, which then does a pretty good job of showing what if a sport is bad. There's a few tweaks, couple tweaks to be made to the video by that but by and large, it's gives a really good and that's all in for sport.org If you want to check it out. So there's that and then been thinking about this project assistant Transformation Project and the coordinate distribution or distribution of sptrb shouldn't go into and always the back of my mind what's next for this work. And I have that krypton climate briefing which is still on the go I haven't I started working on yesterday. Probably I need like another hour to go through it one more time and I need to get I really want to get that finished and published. Yeah, that's mostly mostly what I'm what I'm working on.
 
14:09
Oh, awesome. Nate, how about you?
 
14:15
Yeah, sorry, I'm off camera. I just got back from a run that took longer than expected and I am in the process. of in the middle of things. Before I forget, I wanted to mention that the next gitcoin grants rounds. I think they announced the dates are coming up. And I haven't looked into what it looks like. Exactly. I know it's going to be different but it could be interesting for either super benefit as a whole or Systems Transformation separately and are in for sport separately. Not sure what would anyway
 
14:52
we're all lined up date for the like we've been working with gitcoin about this okay, for it all in for sport, but you raise a good point it had me and occurred to me that we might consider it for Super benefit. But you have to 50,000 matching so that's been a bit of a lift that we haven't got to yet for all in for sport. So
 
15:13
I see. Okay, yeah, I didn't look up the details for you, but
 
15:16
to be honest, this is interesting mentioned that because this is the sparks that happen is I wonder Heenal If some of the Ontario Trillium Foundation money, if could they like they leveraged money, that's what they want to do. So if we could think about that in the context of this. So thank you. Nate. I'm gonna think about that.
 
15:37
Yeah.
 
15:41
To the tech man's mentality, are you right? Yeah. What's the difference? Well, super benefits right for me for Super benefit. We qualify for the core round.
 
15:53
Yeah. So there's five core rounds. And one of them is a kind of like a web three community round. And with the core round, there's because it's been voted in by the gitcoin community. It's already you know, the the mechanisms around like actually bringing it to fruition, it's already been taken care of. Now, you could also potentially qualify for one of the featured rounds. And and if somebody's stepping forward, saying, Hey, I'm gonna run this featured round. You, as a potential grantee aren't responsible for bringing any funding for it you weren't responsible for to bring $50,000 If you say, hey, we want to lead this featured round on X, Y or Z. In doing that, you're also saying we are eligible because we have done the following things we have the minimum 50 grand we have this we have that the other things that are part of it. And so I think my understanding is like with all in for sports, you're leveraging the protocol. But you could absolutely be a potential grantee in the upcoming round like what Nate is saying. Do you mean Sorry?
 
17:06
The featured rounds, are they announced? Do we know what any of the featured rounds are yet or was that? Just a call rounds that have been announced at the moment?
 
17:16
To my knowledge, it's just the core rounds that have been been announced. But I'm also got a little telegram thing going with some of the core people that I'm sure you all have been working with at get coin if you just shoot them a message to see if they have any more information on it. But they also they also said that because they're running on their protocol, Grant stacks now. There's like they're literally figuring out things as they go. So so there's there's definitely going to be not only hiccups in the road, but just some things that it's like, we'll know this in two days, like we don't know right now. But in terms of featured rounds, I know that people are gearing up for them. I don't know what they are as of yet.
 
18:11
Okay, well, this could be an interesting moment because we can let's let's so let's carry on Nate and then Lindsey because Lindsay's background being from the giving block, there could be something I don't know what you're gonna have to give us an update on your life, Lindsey, but there could be a collaborative spirit here on this particular as a potential. We're getting to the next ideas part, but hey, Nate, do you want to do to finish up I'm sorry, I
 
18:35
just forgot I wanted to mention it. Yeah, for me it I've been doing like this blog post in the back burner for a while. It's been kind of a crazy week, which is why I missed last week. And but yeah, I'm going today, whether or not I'm happy with it. I'm going to send a draft of the blog post to give a look at and at least see if there's some nugget within there that feel good. But yeah, that's all I've been working on. And yeah, just I'm unsure certain of my capacity, especially the next few months, so we'll see. But yeah, that's me.
 
19:23
Right Lindsay Do you want to introduce yourself to
 
19:31
me? So I've met some of you, if not all of you. But yeah, so my background is in nonprofit fundraising. And then I was at the giving block for the past year so really focused in on crypto philanthropy, and then just getting personal interest in Dows and sort of more crypto native fundraising and governance and all that sort of thing. Update on my life is just chill in looking at all I'm like, Oh, do I want to do sustainable finance now? Do I want to ESG so yeah, I'm in an exploratory phase of my life. So nothing really to update but open to everything. So yeah, I'm still you know, excited about learning more about how I can participate with super benefit, and you know what the needs are?
 
20:34
Right. Well, thank you. Thank you. And then yeah, my quick updates would be the web. Three Systems Transformation session tomorrow, then in Oxford, UK, doing the same kind of version based on whatever we learned tomorrow at marmalade Festival, which is an adjacent festival to Skoll World Forum. And then committee foundations of Canada has a conference and we're having a web three and philanthropy session there and and just working with the Ontario Trillium Foundation who's interested in this work and testing it out with the Dow and so a quality Fund is a foundation that does global work, and they are looking at a disco and decentralized, cooperative concept. And so just yeah, I'm curious to see if we can test out the real true opportunities to to do like to engage those who are on the ground, most impacted from an equity who are historically excluded, but in a foundation context and and see what we can do. And then the dream would be to be using some of the governance stuff that's been being dreamed up in Super benefit all in for support and a playbook specific to philanthropy. So those are kind of a guess connected to some potential new ideas. And the CFC conference is in Toronto this year. So we're, that's where we're hosting it. So those are the things I'm working on related to this particular work. And all in for sport. I'm part of the community experience team and doing the like mostly focused on Twitter spaces that this was just because of my limited time. So but anybody like Suzy music to my ears, if that's something and I, I do think like, Yeah, I think there's something cool happening there. And I feel like wherever we go next, we want to be testing some of the stuff in Super benefit, because I think it's a little loosey is maybe my very academic term for today. So we could tighten things up and maybe live by some of the stuff that we're putting in the governance Docs. So okay, well, maybe he you know, you look like you had to go off camera, so maybe the contribution thing, didn't run it. Maybe we keep riffing on the ideas, or do you want Oh, you're back. What would you like? Come back? Oh, yeah. Do you want to do the knowing we're at 430? So maybe let's keep this to 10 minutes and then but you maybe you can catch us up, including me? Where are we at with this thinking?
 
23:18
Sorry, on the contrary on the contribution piece
 
23:21
Yeah. Maybe like going way back because some people know some of it like how much sptrb We have and what is it for and
 
23:34
yeah, so I guess I guess just briefly when we started the Systems Transformation Project, there was an allocation of of sptrb, which is super benefits governance token towards this project. And then who did it really initially that was for our initial explorations, and then the for this project kind of kept going? And then there was discussion a few weeks back, an emotion proposal to allocate more sptrb to this project and to another project, another cell, and then now we've got to decide how we how we allocate that and I guess it's good opportunity. I think more than anything to kind of draw a line under the work we've done so far. And just be you know, and say this, you know, this is the work that was proposed has happened. And this is the you know, it's almost I don't know if I'm saying this out loud, if you want to do some kind of reports on its shorts, you know, like you just did, maybe, maybe we maybe we have something like that removes maybe it's I don't know, I don't know if anything we have already we would kind of fit that code sort of criteria. Like, here's a little one page of like, this is all the things we've done. We're wrapping it up. But anyway, so the thought was, you know, how do we allocate this sptrb Given that this problem has gone on for quite a few months, and it's different people involved, some people more active than others as you'd expect and then, and so we thought, we thought that what's a good way of doing it, whether it's a coordinate process, or something else, or some combination of things, which we don't necessarily need to make that decision. Exactly. Right now, but what we've big is, again, Michelle and I talking about it, and I want to propose it to you guys, or is that regardless of how we decide to allocate the tokens. The important first step is just really noting the contributions that have been made by everybody that's part of this process as well. It's like, okay, you know, these tokens have a notional, you know, you know, if some what happened for Alec valley, but the, there's no financial value, because, but there's just in terms of recognition. It's like, there's a process which we would do if you know if you did a coordinate process, this is part of that process, regardless, and it's built into that coordinate app, which we weren't doing but it's just noting down the register of contributions. So who has done what's so going to be it'll be like a page on clarity. We just have, everyone would enter just their name and what they've contributed to the to the project, essentially. And yeah, it's just an opportunity for intimate personal video to look back at what you've done and reflect and write it down. And then, you know, that everyone else can see it was transparent, and it's, you know, ideas. It's supposed to be, you know, being able to surface the contributions and recognize them. And there's different forms of recognition that don't make sense. So that's what I would propose is that we set that up that page, I said, clarity, and everyone makes an attempt to in the next week of filling, filling that out with their contributions today. So you look back at past meeting notes, look at your own notes, and might just be you know, three, four or 510 I don't know bullet points, but it's all it's all it's all valid to put there. Yeah, that's why I suppose what I want to say so Susie, you asked in the chat, any thoughts on using govern? Not sure if you've looked into it yet? I haven't. I know that. I know the governance team has I have not looked into it. Do you want to you want to speak to that and say what you think it might do or how we would use it? I don't I don't know much about it, to be honest. And so if you want to share how you think it might be valuable to us, we're definitely open to that.
 
27:54
I mean, there's just a couple of thoughts. One is governor's being used more and more. I mean, it's for the for them. It's like the tagline of like, easily track record and own your own Dell contributions. I don't think you have to be a quote unquote Dow to use it. But it's just a super easy way to track record and and own it. But also, I think it's because more will just say Dows for now are using it. It's a it's a great the more that people are using this then then when they go to to a different Dow or different dials like they've already been trained in the tools. I think coordinate serves like a really specific serve purpose. So I guess it would just depend on you know, what it is that you all are trying to accomplish. And but I've but from from what I've heard thus far from the people that have been using this it's just it's like easy keeps coming, like keeps people keep saying like how easy it is. It also allows for for kind of more of an emergence around certain things. So you don't have to, like name or hoop something right yet in terms of like, this is what I'm working on and working towards and working for. And I'm trying to think of I don't I I'm not sure if with coordinate how easy it is for it to be trying to think of the term my tongue where where you can literally carry it with you through all the different throughout the ecosystem. Or Or if it's only applicable to that particular project that you're working with. I forget the word it's almost in my tongue. But with governance you know, I almost think of like this data backpack and it's part of your data backpack and you can take it wherever you go and and share the information that you want shared. But I'm not sure if that's the same with coordinate
 
30:23
good points on Yeah, no, you don't I'm pretty sure you cannot do that with coordinate by that. i That's why I think tools like governing have arisen that does does govern allow you to do the allocation distribution thing that coordinate does as well or is it just for the record recording the
 
30:40
contribution? That's my understanding because we're starting to use it over at radar. Okay. And, yeah, because they're gonna be I think distributing USDC based off of the work that's that's being done for this current you know, this initiative all around play
 
31:11
well, I know, like, I have no preference, because you know, I'm not like I know you've kind of set up the coordinate. But if we want, like, I'm really open to how we want to collaborate to get here. I think some of the I guess just what would I say? I think we were trying to get clear about why we're doing this right now. And it is like one of those things that takes a bit of detail and like could require somebody to go back in all of our notes to see like who was at different meetings because people won't know that off the top of their head and just having a more like, doing this more often. I think is what's coming up here I think will be helpful because we'll all have to dig deep. So I do have a couple I have somebody starting with me for the summer as an intern who's really interested in web three. And I could have her do a little bit of this background work. Because I think it would be a great learning opportunity, but it just depends if we want to be more imminent with this or not.
 
32:21
I think the other thing too is if we're asking people to put to take time and to be reflective. You want them to be able to have that data and be able to use it later. You know, so So asking people to do that knowing that they can't then apply it to anything else is, is definitely an ask. You know, sure. It's like oh, hey, but you're doing it to get governance tokens. But then there's this inherent assumption that people want governance tokens, like that's how I want to be recognized.
 
32:49
Yeah. I know you've mentioned that before and when and I tried to express this. Maybe to you here, but I don't think I did it justice.
 
33:02
Yeah, no, I think it's kind of it's kind of like it just like the goal of I think, rep to rep, proactive funding. I think it plays a really, I think it could play a really impactful role, especially for in the equity space in the like when you're thinking about justice, equity, diversity, inclusion space, because so I think it can play a really interesting role. I think it plays a really interesting role for people who are wanting to invest like whether it's VC funding or something like that. But when we're thinking about like, hey, we just want to give a head nod. A we want to recognize, we want to celebrate you retroactive funding is an interesting tool to use. But it's also may not be the one that aligns with the people and what they're what motivates them. Because you I think the goal is to is to hopefully kind of fuel their their curiosity and interest to continue moving forward on with your organization versus taking it and being like, buy. Like so there's that one piece. The other piece is it kind of reminds me of the research that's been done around. Payment like salaries when some somebody has so much money, but money isn't going to be the thing that's going to motivate them to do the thing. And so, for some people getting money, for instance, whether it's like USDC or whatever, is a big motivator because it's like look, you know, I'm pretty much running on empty here. Any funding I could get is huge. Where somebody else it's like, okay, that's nice, but that's not gonna motivate me. The thing with governance, the challenge that I have with that is it although you're saying, Hey, this is in recognition of your work, I think there's also this like, I'm wondering if we're taking a step to better understand what actually motivates our community. Because it could be something as simple as a LinkedIn post. That like that's what somebody wants, like, I want to be named, so people can click that I'm affiliated with this project. And, you know, this is what, you know, what people said like attestations, about kind of how I participated, and that to me, would be super motivating. And it would be like That's awesome. I could be acknowledged in that way. So, whereas with governance, the challenge, like another challenge is it's this assumption that people want to participate, when it actually takes a lot of work to participate. And often those who are kind of most of the margins don't have those resources, whether it be time attention, you know, other things, to feel to potentially feel like hey, I can participate and do this well, because that's a lot of times what we want to be able to do we recognize that it's going to be a challenge. We want to be able to grow and to learn. And if we are given something that we can't do that with, then the opposite could end up happening. You know, we feel like we aren't serving our purpose. We may feel like we aren't contributing in an effective way we start comparing ourselves to other people who are contributing, you know, maybe I'm not they just gave me all this and I'm not living up to what that valued member means that status, like what it means. And and although it's nice to have a say in governance, there's so much work that goes into it to really you know, be a thoughtful contributor, that it's often one of those things that doesn't align with equity, because of because of everything that it takes to participate in it, but aligns with it in the sense that if you contribute, then you can have a voice and a choice in where we're going what we're trying to do. So it's like this is very fine line. So I guess I would just say, what's the purpose? What's the goal? What are you trying to achieve? And what's your understanding of those who will be receiving whatever it is? In terms of what actually motivates them?
 
37:31
Okay, well, thank you, and I hope people don't mind I'm using otter AI notes. And so I think there's a blog in there Suzy butts core. We're web three Thursday, because I think yeah, I think that's interesting to people have a good kind of anything you want to share back on that or do we want to just, yeah, just keep this conversation going and shift to like, ideas, including capturing some of us
 
38:04
I guess just to respond a little bit to that, like I've been, I've just been looking into golf. And while we've been while you're talking and so I've got I can see, I guess it really comes down to what is the intention of what we're doing right. And so the garden is good. I can see how that's great to record contributions and then it's you meant that and you've got like, you've got that but it's it is definitely a lot more involved than what we're talking about of like just the contribution register. I guess how we did it with super benefit that link I dropped in there. I don't know if that's helpful, but But it's literally just you know, each person would write five to 10 bullet points of stuff that they've done. So literally, you know, it could take doesn't take you very long to do. Whereas government is a little bit more involved in that you name it your name of contribution, activity type details, proof of contribution. So it's a little bit more a little bit more involved. And certain things like yeah, I don't know, it feels like I feel like I'd still be valuable. Like, you know, it'd be definitely great to track but I'm not sure if all of the contributions would be would be with fall under that or I don't know I feel it feels like a bit more of an ask for people but I can see how it definitely has value over governance tokens, which may or may not be for everyone's may not be interesting to everyone. I guess I'm not clear. If If once say someone, I guess we would need to you would have this contribution allocated to the dowel. So this would only be for Super benefit. You wouldn't be able to set up like for the Systems Transformation Project. We wouldn't we wouldn't be like, would we have to set up this cell as a separate Dao on the govern platform in order to be able to see the contributions just for this project? Maybe maybe, maybe we would to do that. And maybe it becomes quite I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah,
 
40:01
I would definitely suggest reaching out to I always think of his Twitter handle stuff. The love it is cuz he's, he's so on it. But it's, but it be. The other thing I've heard is is is as a community of people being able to look at how are people spending their time where are they spending it? Is that is that actually pushing our mission and vision forward? Where I don't know how easy it is to get a high level view of that with coordinate. And then again, I'm just thinking about you know, being able to take this with you so when you're participating, you know, just so like, but it also depends on what some people might who have done this work might be like, Oh, I don't care about that, you know, I'm so tapped into these these depths that they don't need to know what I'm doing over here and and and therefore, you know, coordinate is great. But I think if if we're thinking about like what is quote unquote impactful around the work that's being done and what you're trying to achieve, are these initiatives, the feeling that and where are the data points? around it? That's where I think, you know, government could, because that's my understanding of it, but I would take everything I say with a grain of salt and I guess we're going to follow up with them to see what they say.
 
41:36
Okay, well, let's let's shift from this a little bit, but I think we do need to probably make a decision because I think we like we could we at some point. I do think we're kind of going around this a little bit and I think we just probably need to Yes, sense into so maybe we can try to reflect on this and then I think you know, in part what I noticed is like when somebody if Heenal if you're willing to do a bit of the technical side then you know, letting us know in your own web three journey where you want to do a bit more learning and which one feels like that helps is also can be one of the factors of what we choose to do, because because I don't I don't have the skill set or I don't that's not an area where I feel like I want to lean into so let's come back to this and see but I think this like this fits with super benefit because I think it's like this is part of governance and how we work together and really intentional ways and building a nice reflective moments is really important. So thank you for everybody's voices in this and thanks Susie for repeating what you told me once because I think I wasn't I wasn't grabbing it well. Nate Do you have any like I know you've done a lot of this and forefront and I'm curious what do they use they're just quickly have forgotten you told me but
 
43:07
they they have they tried things in different things in the past. They were sort of just doing their own thing. But I also just looked at gov and it looks pretty interesting, but I'd want to actually like try it and I think the thing about gov or any of it is you're asking people to learn a new system and as with coordinate so it's a question of how easy it is to use the new system
 
43:40
but definitely like say Oh shut up. That's okay. Okay. So let's, let's, let's shift a little bit so maybe some Okay, so maybe I can try to summarize what I've heard about ideas, and then people can just riff off of that. So I know the piece of jokey the way she described what she had talked to Susie about with some sort of like, kind of a maybe a virtual card deck or maybe real card deck but that gets at some of the web three and Systems Transformation but with a real equity lens with the mindful futurism lens with you know, just some of the pieces that I know and and I would say there's no expectation from CFCs perspective on anything that she writes or does like she really is kind of charting our own course on this stuff. So I leave that with her and then whether or not some of this is other work that she decides to do, because she's only with us 10 hours a week on this stuff. So I will kind of let that continue and I think like I've communicated to her and that the super benefit is like wide open if somebody wants to put a proposal forward and you know request will support on what like the format of how we do that. Like any ideas that we're going to mention right now. No, no, we don't have to get consensus here. People can go off on pathways and do whatever, you know, bring things forward but just for the sake of trying to bring forward everything we've heard. That was one thread Another one was the piece around like even what you're already doing Nate and some of the blog writing people are doing and ways that people are trying to express some of the concepts of systems transformation, governance, you know, what, what's on people's mind, and even potentially some videos or like, or images with quotes and things that we might pull out of existing writing and poetic harvesting that's been there and using that as a bit of a way to showcase some of the work on Twitter spaces. Some of the work like if people are interested like I am doing a lot of presentations and and can loop that doesn't have to be me like if that's something people are interested in and you want to be involved in some of these opportunities or you have your own that you want to engage people in the philanthropy thread around like building out an example of a fund that's shared and were in the example of Equality Fund or some of the others were those that are in the community are actually doing the decision making similar to what I guess we're talking about with all in for sport. But trying to write up a little bit about philanthropy itself in a playbook. And we I think even in writing the latest grant for on for sport, you know, nudged a little bit for us to be a bit more explicit about that, like, what is it that we're trying to shift in the system around philanthropy? And I think there's more I don't think people are writing about that as deeply as they could not just like shifting the granting, because granting is only a piece of it, but I think there's huge connections to to equity governance, and even some of the impact investing and innovative financing that's happening out there. And I'm just gonna pause there. Those were off the top of my head things I've heard from this this particular Oh, sorry, the SDG stuff. Sorry. My apologies. Maybe Heenal or Nate. Maybe Nate will get your voice into this if you want to share that one a little bit.
 
47:33
I haven't been thinking about that CG thing much. So I don't really have anything new to say, unfortunately.
 
47:42
Okay. So yeah, there was some ideas of like, but how what was that concept if you had to sum it up in a couple sentences, because I don't think I can.
 
47:51
Yeah, I think it's just that some, like the SDGs are a framework of trying to impact the world you know? In that people understand in the broader impact space. So if we could relate how what web three uniquely enables and map that to how it could potentially address the SDGs that could be something that that people would understand and maybe resonate with a little bit. And maybe that work, would also lead us to reimagine a new sort of framework that's better than SDGs are more interconnected, that that just doing the work could be informative for us, you know, is what was the thought there?
 
48:39
Mm hmm. Okay, awesome. Any other ones people want to put into the
 
48:49
space here.
 
48:52
It can be something that isn't even super benefit to take up. It's just something on your mind where you are maybe putting a call out for support or not.
 
49:18
Nothing coming up for people. You think we got it? All.
 
49:26
Did I lose you? We're good. Was there anything like that? You know, for those like that you're really excited about that you feel energized about or I guess Plan A, F or G or H? It could be that we wind this work down and then just see where this emerges? I mean, like I think some of us have shifted some energy a little bit to all in for sport because it's almost like we're trying to live out the system's transformation in an actual like moment, as opposed to being a bit theoretical about it. And then we could see where we, you know, where that thrives and where there's failure and like, where are we going to write about that? Or if there's another one, like you know, I don't know I'm open
 
50:30
I'm curious about cuz I still don't know. I don't really have a sense of like, who the super benefit community is like. I mean, I know there's stuff going around all around the all and for sport, the governance and the community engagement is that the other piece that for all and then I know there's a Systems Transformation, but other than that, I don't really have a sense of who the community is, or, or maybe I missed, like, is there a channel where a bunch of the community is chatting? Because I'm just curious, like, what are the community needs? If we've got a group of people who who want to spend time working on things like how might we be in service of them? Is it Are they really pumped about systems transformation and in servicing that, then we can put that's content that first and foremost serves the Dow and then could potentially serve others? Like what like what would be in service of the Dow and you know, great case scenario would be it's also in service of others. But that's something that keeps thinking about is like, what's what, what, why are people here and are they amped about it and what are the potential gaps that that could be addressed?
 
51:55
Like I think the super benefit community is actually like even those of us a few 100 people in there. A lot of them came in in the early days, because they were, like kind of engaged through a web three adventure tour as somebody in the social impact space, who might want to go on a learning journey or what's curious about web three. So I'd say you know, the active pieces are the all the people who've been showing up in here. The people in the governance work there's a piece around the transformation mapping with Crosshouse, but it's a lean machine, I would say so I'm not sure. And I think early on, we thought we need lots and lots of people but I think now we're just more like yeah, kind of trying to nurture where nodes in the network are. There are cells in the network are making sense. But I feel like this one, like just if I'm being honest, it's like lost a little bit of like, focus of where we're going and I think that's okay, because I think we're living out exactly the the beauty and murkiness of web three
 
53:07
Yeah, yeah, they're well said well said Michelle, I think speak to your point Susie this yeah, there's not that many people like there's a lot of I mean there's some luck there's there's a lot of people lurking in discord but actually, what we find when we you know, when we've tried to, you know, put something in announcements, shower, put them in the general channel no one really responds right? There's not really like it's been a while since discord has really been active, apart from a couple of channels that are very, like the the primitives channel a little bit the system transformation. That's very kind of work focused. And for a while we were trying to you know, I guess for awhile we briefly we kind of thought about building super benefit how to get more people coming in this is the the experience and everything, but actually, it's just the way that it's, we've kind of moved away from trying to build like super benefit as a thing. And it's more like where can we have impact or where can we do the work and, you know, everybody's kind of filled in, it's kind of just a little bit goes with what people's capacity is for different things. You know, I think there's not that many people who have a lot of capacity to do a lot of things and so that kind of that that's partly but that's partly kind of impacts what the shape of super benefits and how many people are active. Gosh, I don't know doesn't maybe, you know, if you not probably not probably not more than that. I don't I don't think that actually active in doing something to benefit. And there's, you know, there's other probably other people who are kind of tangential things that are related. So and then like, like, you know, a lot of energy shifted to all in for sport like I pretty much that's, you know, that's a lot where of in terms of the limited out of my life, this is how much I have available for work and there's a much higher variable for web three out of that most of that is now currently in in order for sport so yeah, they all about smaller mighty so that yeah, I guess that is that's just yeah, that's, I don't know, I don't know what else I was gonna say on that.
 
55:24
And I might add, like, I think it's curious because I did I like I as super benefit is a little more about experiments or testing things out, as people get pulled all in for sport, like, does that kind of is that is that a positive thing that we're testing there or does it erode super benefit and how do we keep some core of super benefit in its governance and energy as we do these experiments? And I think the sense is that people should like individuals, people should be able to follow what feels like the right place for them. And if, if in some ways, we have to re rethink super benefit because of that then I think that's okay, because that's where we're at. So that's kind of a something on my on my mind.
 
56:14
Yeah, cuz we've talked for a while about like doing a 2.0 governance structure even like in the new revolution, right? We we've been on rev one we were on web zero for a while but it will season you know season and then we want season one for the longest time. And we've talked about wrapping this up and you know, season two, but there's just hasn't been no one's had time the energy to do it. So we just keep you know, that's the thing. It all takes everything takes effort and work and so it's like, I guess it's okay, I guess, either the some time would become available or other resources became available that probably shift things you know, if if financial resources became available, then people would be able to put more time into it. And then more things would happen on those some of those things I would I would imagine, or if all if a sport takes off, I think that'll have some knock on effects that you know when that when that takes off, and we get lots of people flooding into the order for all of the sport discord, some of those people would find their way to see the benefit and they would probably get another injection of energy and momentum with that, but it's a moment it's like this little bit of in between the space, but I think that's okay. That helps Susie. Okay, by Lindsey so
 
57:33
and I'll just pop in this. I've shared this before, but because I have to send something into OTF. Like, if we were able to get some of that money for some of the things that have sparked up here around the gitcoin piece, like some Yeah, well, I think we're going to the thread around people getting paid we have 3000 in our like in the systems transformation work to so if people have proposals, they can put that forward we're seeing that kind of as a thread for new space so so because it's five o'clock, let's pause and pick up on the ideas piece. I am away over the next couple well three weeks, but let me look at my calendar and see I forget what time it is in the UK when I'm when I'm there and see if we can Yeah, because I'd like to see how we keep this moving along but or others can meet without me. But I appreciate this. This is like yeah, helping. Helping tech COMM And then yeah, feel free Nate when you feel good about that blog, pop it to us and we can give you some feedback Have a beautiful day. Thanks. Thank you useful time. Thanks, buddy. Yeah, can I grab you for one second? Can you come up on 15 minutes before or half an hour before the one tomorrow you look blocked off so I want to be respectful of that from like if we're doing four till five just to make sure that we have all the videos and everything. Or you can just set up the links on your computer and we can just tap on 10 minutes before maybe. Do you have something right ahead of it?
 
59:18
Oh no, that's fine. Okay,
 
59:20
so I'll just top we can just hop on to that. Link.
 
59:24
I don't have it in my calendar. I don't have it.
 
59:27
Oh, you don't. Okay, let me send it to. I'm gonna do that right now.
 
59:37
Okay, transition patient group. So I'll do 345 Does that sound good? That's enough time till five. Sometimes we go a few minutes after. So I'll put transmission innovation group three, and I'm not sending you the one that's like week after week week because I know that doesn't work. So I'm giving you a separate one with Zoom Lincoln it though. Okay, great. Have a good night. Hey, thanks. Thank you. Okay, Bye

**SUMMARY KEYWORDS**
people, philanthropy, web, super, systems, benefit, bit, lindsay, impact, transformation, tokens, coordinate, epoch, thinking, charity, nonprofit, feel, space, piece, cfc
 
00:00
Couple of things on my mind related to and we can catch Lindsey up to what I mean when I say this but the distribution of the SP ARB tokens and the coordinate piece for this part of the work. The update on what's going on with the dowels and philanthropy Heenal I don't know if you saw my note but stuff has shifted there fast so we're gonna chat through an approach on that and and then just Yeah, where we might go next with this work and Lindsey now that you're like a whole weekend, what else is your mind? So what's what would you like to add to the conversation today? Both of you.
 
00:45
I'm going to still I'm going to do a lot of listening. Sure. See where I need to jump in.
 
00:53
Okay. He know anything else you would want to know Not right
 
00:59
now, but something might have sparked for me as we go along, but I think those are pretty good ticket things to start with.
 
01:05
Okay, and maybe just to loop you both in so in jokey and Susie had been talking about some sort of like card deck that might be able to be created related to web three equity and systems transformation. And, and so I think they because they're both kind of in different parts right now. They they're gonna connect on that and so what I suggested was like, yeah, for them to come up with the concept, put a proposal together, put it to super benefit, you know, add in if there's some to see what that might look like. And rather than feeling like they have to come to this meeting, to get it approved, like just go and figure out what you want to do and and really see that there's some openness and to doing that, so we'll see where that particular idea goes. And then maybe on the Dow's and philanthropy So, Lindsay I might have mentioned to you we hosted Well, we've had a few foundations in Canada interested North pine, Ontario Trillium Foundation and equality funded this space, hosted 1000 philanthropy salon with them a few weeks ago hadn't really heard too much. And so last night, we're like, Oh, I wonder if we could get some feedback what's going on? And then this morning, I woke up to I'm heading the Skoll World Forum in Oxford, UK, and I'm doing a presentation on web three and systems transformation that Heenal was a huge help in creating. Did I say share it with you yet? I'll put it in the chat that link. And it turns out Sue Snider from Equality Fund is going and so she's pulling together like web three conversation with some folks. And I'm like, Well, I'm actually doing a workshop. You should come and you should be one of the many case studies about what you're dreaming up at a equality fund. So, so that's what we're gonna do. So I think what like what what's on my mind is the Ontario Trillium Foundation has some money that I'm going to meet with them about on Monday. And if we could get equality fun as a possible experiment to test some of this governance and Systems Transformation and philanthropy. It could be a partnership with SuperBenefit Ontario, Trillium Foundation, Equality Fund, Community Foundations of Canada. Whoever would figure that out, and just start to like, yeah, see how we can support that work, and then see if there's some playbook or something related to Dows and philanthropy using the lens of what's coming up, connected to Systems Transformation and our Aha, yesterday was a bit that it like it's the governance that is the difference like that. We think is the difference around some of the systems transformation or that makes that is specific to web three and what it enables. So I kind of pause there I think, what is my question to both of you, 
 
I can just download it as a Word doc quickly here. Yeah.
 
06:14
Let me see. This is this is good stuff. Michelle. And yeah, I think. Yeah, I think this is Rich ground is 1000 1000. And the philanthropy was kind of come full circle a little bit from where we were at like a year and a half ago. Which is
 
06:34
to share more about that. Given the charity connection Lindsay had, like, how would you characterize that?
 
06:39
Yeah, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Well, from my perspective, what it looked like when we fairly fit in the fairly early days of super benefit, one of the one of the things we were trying to push or encourage was how do we how do we get more people from the charity or social enterprise or nonprofit Foundation Philanthropy space into web three. And the idea being at that time, but we thought it was like, you know, web three was happening, but the people that were doing it, people who have come from tech space, financial space, entrepreneurial startup space, and they just didn't have the context or experience or knowledge of like, decades and centuries of work in nonprofits. And charities. And so yeah, we were trying to, we thought we could try to onboard people into the work that we were doing, or just realizing so they're just learning curve is quite steep, too steep, and there has to end without some kind of incentive, or reason for needing to do it. You can't really is hard hard for people. So yeah, that was the that was the that was the that was the challenge. So it was it was just And then so now coming full circle is now that okay, now charities are potentially coming to us and saying this is something we want to explore. That makes sense. I guess it I guess the recognizing maybe for other commerce, there's just the Meet the landscape is shifting for me in the media, the perception of web three, and just people's awareness of what's possible. You don't want to get left behind. So it's like kind of things have shifted a little bit
 
08:27
I will say not much
 
08:33
Yeah. Yeah. So So yeah, no I see this is now being missed potential. I mean, firstly, I mean, I think they think the presentation that you gave, you gave a couple of weeks ago, was good, and I think it looks like from what I'm seeing in this one that you've got here from marmalade even, like, even even better, so I think there's there's there's potentially something that can be this can be developed, keep, you can keep on developing this and have this as a presentation, maybe even you know, make it make something that's like a like a like a thing that we can as well as the live live events. or something, maybe it maybe it is a repeating live event, or maybe it is something that is packaged and put out there. But I mean, I think there's value in that by itself, but also Yeah, absolutely. But then the opportunity to actually go and do the work with with charities is the real juicy part and experiment with that. So I'm super excited about what that could look like, with with Equality Fund or whoever, whoever might be the case. Yeah,
 
09:48
I'm just reading. I'm like, I'm listening. Reading at the same time. It's super cool.
 
09:57
And like I said, I'm open to please feel free to put in
 
10:00
and this is something that like, Are you already down the road with them on that
 
12:52
I'm not sure if this is what you mean. So there's sort of two things I see a play. So in general, I mean, in the world, nonprofits everywhere, this, this whole idea of the expert that you know, and people putting themselves out as the expert. You want to go to the person with the knowledge who's like, Yep, I'm the one to know. And I feel like in the nonprofit world that is still very much alive and well. And what I love about web three is it's like an invitation to be playful and the idea if you term yourself an expert, you're going to be laughed out of the room. Because nobody's an expert. We're all students we're all learning we're all growing together. So I feel there's that there's a weird thing where where people then go to the they come out of that space and then brand themselves an expert to go consultant and to be like, okay, you know, here's my course or here I'm going to teach you everything about it. Nobody can teach anything, anything about it because it's fluid and it's growing and it's, it's still taking shape. So anyone but I think there is that that need for people. What is this just help me and package it so I can understand it and move on. And then I also think the other piece is I notice in the nonprofit world, this very sort of extractive and entitled, attitude towards and here I'm going to say crypto, but probably web three as well that don't necessarily think it's anything serious, but they want the money from it. So it's just like okay, if you package this and also this, this the scarcity mindset that is runs through the nonprofit world there is it's a small pie. And maybe with that the secrecy like we need to get the secret we need to be the ones to know it. is not for everyone, it's just for us because we're gonna get it and that was something we were always trying to fight was, you know this talk about the abundance and now the giving block itself is like gone into scarcity and because you know, the bear market and everything so it's it's almost perpetuating this idea that that it is scarce, and there's not enough seats at the table. And there are secrets to unlock. So yeah, I don't know that does that.
 
Ash arrives
16:41
Yeah, I'm so sorry. I was out for about a month in traveling. Then when I came back there was a lot of protests. So for some reason, all my meetings are around this time. I decided like even if it's late, I'm gonna join and say hi to everyone. So hi.
 
16:59
This is Lindsay tipping and we met last week. She was working with the giving block and she's intrigued with super benefit. So maybe the two of you can do a quick hello to one another.
 
17:11
Hi, my name is Ash was always absent.
 
17:16
Hi, great to meet you. Yeah, I'm just really excited to to learn more about what we're doing. Part of it. Yeah. This isn't my first time really participating in a dowel even though I've been learning welcome for a long time. So yeah, really excited.
 
17:34
And asked How would you describe what you do besides hanging out with us?
 
17:38
Oh, why the stock questions? So I yeah, I will tell everyone that I do program evaluation. But there's a lot more to it like not just each well. Probably better because like Michelle I also hit them. But it's probably volition to build a complex problem solving change management strategy all makes.
 
18:05
Cool. So as we were just chatting through with some opportunities around Dows and philanthropy, and yeah, just some good reflections and learning about where we might go next with this work and I think maybe Heenal Is it fair to say like, we're thinking that we started on a pathway with this web three and systems transformation. And there was a recent proposal if you go back through snapshot to allocate sptrb And we have a bit of I think, $3,000 in the treasury that we could use for future work. So we're thinking that and I'll let Heenal speak to how this might work. But we might look at this as like, you know, path one is or what do we call revolution of this project of the cell? is kind of closing and like allocate the SP or B for this part and then think about where we want to go next. And maybe it's actually putting proposals out. So if we decide to go to the Transformation philanthropy route, or I mentioned Suzy and jokey wanting to maybe create a card deck or depending where people want to go, we might start a new Is that Is that a fair assessment? You know? Okay, yeah, so I think so. Yes, maybe to finish on the Taoism, philanthropy. Ash. There's a presentation in Oxford, UK on April 11 that I'm doing with a quality fund. And, and, and then we have a presentation at the community foundations of Canada conference in June that Heenal And Ian joki are supporting. So we have a few places we can test out some of the stuff and we were just talking about the difference between showing up as learner and expert.

19:57
Thank you. Yeah, totally. Kind of. It's lovely to see that we are evolving. Going into the next phase from wanting I just wanted to share, obviously, meeting with many people talking about innovation. I always talk about now with the Dow and what does that mean the opportunities and everything and how it is an active area of innovation. Where the potentiality contribution and using utilizing it in many ways. We meet many ways there's a lot. One thing I want to highlight in my introduction in the social innovation sector, particle in the capital and in the government. Is that I think we need maybe some I don't know how to say it. People are very much fearful about all the terms and everything. So kind of making sure some easy to understand plain language what with the Dow and like some knowledge mobilization, output. It can be like a LinkedIn like a beautiful graphic poster and everything. If you can create those I can popularize those in the community because I believe people are stuck on the big terms and everything which I was also stuck on with a giant I'm continuously learning about all of this, but opportunity of thinking in this way. Which I call Darwin or like, was one of our continuous progression. of ecosystem development and innovation and change together. So that can be very useful. Yeah.














 
21:46
Mm hmm. Well, it's interesting. You said that because I used to think there was so many good resources, but then when I went to build out this this presentation, I was like, these are old like they're kind of now a year old and I unless people see it, have something at their fingertips, send it to me, but I felt like it hasn't evolved necessarily. And I think it's because when the market drops like it did some of that work that was happening is not like it's not able to happen anymore, because people are having to go back to other kinds of roles or, you know, yeah, so it just feels like something has shifted. So that is interesting. For sure. And like maybe making it specific to social impacts philanthropy, innovation would be an interesting,






 
22:34
yeah, even some specific challenges. For example, Maori CMAC is my client and I talk about housing, ecosystem housing, innovation a lot. And the more we look into the overall housing ecosystem, there's a lot of different components. And CMAC can play a role play a role of innovation broker, because they cannot do everything they don't know everything. And this is where a community knowledge and almost like I don't know if I'm not calling it down because they still keep too many other things involved. But going in that direction, involving everyone creating knowledge and creating their space for innovation and contribution for everyone. That is extremely helpful because without that there's a lot of system challenges that CMS is not even seeing or not even predicting, or not even creating a space where people can contribute even without a lot of money or without a lot of like, nifty idea. So that's like if we have some specific area of innovation some specific challenges, we can focus on that.
 
23:45
Other thoughts comments to that?
 
23:48
Yeah, I think there's something there in this and maybe most upon the next phase of work, but of why this presentation and you know, making it something bite size, or like, like, whether it's a poster or I'm thinking like I could see it as like a three minute video. Like there's not a small amount of work to do, but to do like a three minute animated video of just kind of it's opening people's eyes to the potential of what's there, because it's hard to you know, it's hard to kind of maybe grasp it if you don't have the exposure to it. And then I was thinking, again, I haven't fully thought it through but I was thinking like that, for like this event that we do in June, that it could, it could we could could use it as obstacle helping people to brainstorm or like, somehow like it's it's it's without, you know, yes, as I say without being too kind of evangelical about it, but maybe being a bit bit evangelical about it, but like, so this is, you know, what is what is the industry that you're in or what are some of the challenges that you face and we just help people trying to brainstorm like, how web three tools and technologies could help overcome these things. And that's without even going into like, the whole innovation side of things. Yeah. I think because I feel I could get up on stage and do that, you know, when people like at least on a call, like I think we're getting pretty close to trying to understand some of these things and have like, a deck of half a dozen or dozen examples that we can ship that we can that we can kind of speak to, but also thinking hypothetically, this is how you could do this or this is how you could do that. And, and you know, some people it's still not going to resonate for it's probably even the majority of people it's still not going to resonate for because they're gonna think oh this is all theoretical or doesn't won't work in reality or whatever. But that's those are not that people right? We just it's what is the who are the people are gonna think, you know, see, see the possibility of this and then just another thing I've been thinking about, and it's because there was that there was that tweet, I don't know if you saw that Michael shared in a super benefit of Kevin or Joaquin was like about the, you know, the why to you know, why, why and how to build an impact and then deeper response about yeah, that's, you know, that they're trying to just want to try and kind of try and what they're part of what they're trying to do is to have like a playbook on an impact now, and I know we said we didn't, you know, we didn't we don't want to do a playbook on on, you know, a transformational doubt, but it's gonna be very interesting to see what they come up with in that and I think maybe having the confidence if we're there to challenge some of the things that they're saying about about impact, you know, I don't know I don't know how exactly I don't I'm not I'm not super close with that. That network, but if that's where the conversation is happening, I don't know if that's if that is valuable there, too. You know, what I mean to just to challenge some of those things about around what is impact in what is in this impact in that in that context? What else could it be? I don't honestly want to set myself as being oppositional to people, but it's like helping people to think deeper about Yeah, that's a different that's a different that's a different angle. Right. It's completely Have you






 
27:05
read the book yet?
 
27:07
No, I It's
 
27:09
our book. Yeah, to read it. I
 
27:10
haven't read it. Yeah. I was meaning to reach out to her this week, actually, just to catch up. So
 
27:18
you can you I don't know. You know her already. Fairly well. Yeah. So yeah, super well. I kind of I've said this before, but I see that work is the horizon one work in web three. And it's important and it's good because I think it's an entry point, but I think we're trying to do that larger systems transformation. That's kind of I heard a great analogy. Um, Andrew fleet, who Heenal knows from growing chefs, is writing an article right now for this national observer series i has and he has this analogy of like, you know, where you plant these seeds and you only like, kind of look after them for three weeks and you'll end up with micro greens. But if you don't actually continue to attend and care for them, you're not going to get to the garden part. And I think like this is a huge issue in terms of systems issues and funding and but I feel a bit like that with web three. Two is that we're only gonna get microgreens and like kind of solving for the very things that are in front of us, but we're not getting to the big like, the big shifts that we all are feeling so desperate that are taking our breath away because it's so significant right now. So I feel like there's something there and I think we've been pretty clear we don't want to say what other people are not, and like how do we focus on what we are, but when you're in the system's faith space, it's almost impossible to have clear language and you know, so if we can come up with our own seed analogy, I think when when I met with Andrew and he gave me that example, I'm like ah, that's a good one. People can relate microgreens versus you know, a plethora of long term veggies in your garden. So, yeah, I
 
28:58
think for me, like why I'm attracted to this and it's still wrapping my head. around it. The realizing that my entire career has been in nonprofit space and fundraising and philanthropy and I've always been dissatisfied and not knowing why and realizing now it's like, oh, because I just disagree with the entire system. And that's why I got into the crypto classroom, which also like, more of the same in a way. And that's why I'm like, oh, it's the system itself. And I think that impact out if they're just like, Oh, we're just going to do something brand new. Not to say that every impact out but like, I think of one like redemption Dow that spun up to help buy land in the Congo, and it just died. I don't know what happened. But like I was participating in that trying to figure out you know, who Okay, who you need legacy people you need people, they're the activists you need. You need people who spent their lives committed to the change. You can't just be like, cool, we're gonna raise $40 million by rain forest or by a constitution or whatever, like there needs to be the cooperation so impact as themselves if they don't bring along the legacy system. It'll just be two things. Working like this one will be too fast and too unorganized and not have the, the deep knowledge and this one will just be creeping along in the same way it always did. So that's where I feel like this piece is really important because you need to change the the philanthropy world to change that system. And have them start to understand what the impact could be. Then you can have two pieces working hand in hand
 
31:05
something Sure. There were conversations about having incubation or exploration of data ideas. Are we doing that from Super benefit?
 
31:18
Maybe the closest the answer to that might be you know, put me here but we're the all in for sport. We're like testing the governance piece and I don't know if you want to put the link over I can grab it you know, that that Michael posted on Twitter to show where all the governance resources, I'll call them governance. Outline is for all them for sport. But I'd say that's where we're testing it, like the most fulsome we yeah, there's been a lot of ideas since you've left that have kind of come and gone. And actually, I don't know, did you? I had shared this with Lindsay last week, but I don't know if I recall. Did you make any comments in the web? Like we kind of tried to do a snapshot of where we are right now. With the web three.
 
32:06
I did not add anything to that. No,
 
32:09
you haven't. Okay. And I'm thinking for Ash. That might be a good thing to see. But we kind of just we had this like epiphany if I was going to try to capture of a lot of the systems transformation work we've done to date. was more about systems transformation, like more broadly. And we thought maybe the work we're doing is more about what does web three uniquely enable towards Systems Transformation, rather than if you're going to do Systems Transformation and web three, here's what you need to think about. It's a bit of a distinction. You know, if people still want to go down the road of like, here's what you need to think about with systems transformation as you're building out in web three. I think that's totally cool. Who like ethics, this choice, but
 
32:57
and I guess that sort of thing. Maybe Maybe feeds more into the weather impact our work seems to be going right there. That that that's the similar with except ours is a little bit now or I talked about systems transformation. They're talking about impact, which is a bit broader. But still, it's looking at like, what do you need to be doing in order to be achieving this goal? Just the goal is slightly different. But right, yeah. So it's a reframing to a specific aspects of web three, which I think it's good to Yeah, I think it's I think it's, it's good to be focused on those because I think that's probably where we can actually have the most real world impact by actually knowing what those things are. And telling people about talking and talking about them and then putting them into practice, you know, that's where we didn't have the real real impact.
 
33:52
So maybe next step, like feel free, Lindsay, just put any questions that show up for you in there. I've cleaned up some of the past comments, but you could go back if you want to see a previous version maybe. And ash because you've been part of this journey. You're kind of coming back. It'll be an interesting perspective and put any ideas of where you think it could go next, because that's where we're at. We're at the where, where do we go next? So maybe let's move to the sptrb allocation. But I also wanted to ask Heenal Did you want me to Are you ready for the climate climate brief to be shared out to super benefit yet?
 
34:28
I need to I need to I haven't I suppose a couple. I haven't been through one more. I just go through one but I
 
34:33
do one more. Go through. Okay. I was thinking can I help you? But yeah, no, no, go ahead.
 
34:40
Yeah, I will. But thank you for following up should be by this time next week. That's absolutely
 
34:45
yeah. Okay. I see. That in the Systems Transformation realm because it's so integral. So. Okay, so over to you on how we might think about this SP RB piece. Yeah.
 
34:58
Okay. So I think we just do it. Yeah. referred through the coordinate. I got it set up so we have the we haven't we have a coordinate thing set up. I just need everyone's wallet address for it, and then how it works. Is that every we should have one everyone's wallet address. Certainly.
 
35:20
Yeah, we may not have Lindsay's yet. And Suzy hasn't given hers. yet. So we might need to put in the systems transformation for a couple of people's wallets.
 
35:34
And then, and then I've never I've never done coordinate on the backend before. So I'm learning I'm just gonna follow that guide step by step. I've got the share my share my screen so you can see it.
 
35:45
Now I'll just pop the snapshot proposal in so that people can see what was voted on as a next step. In part, maybe Heenal just riffing off of what you said, is that learning these tools as we go and seeing, you know, how they serve the work that we're doing collectively, so.
 
36:07
So this was interesting. So now I realized that I have let me go home. So two super benefits, I realized that this is the old Super benefit. And this is the new super benefit. But jumping is fine, because you can realize you have an organization name, but I didn't want to try and I didn't know if we actually needed this as part of the learning super benefit as the organization or whether this organization name should have actually been existence transformation. It doesn't really doesn't really matter. But this because within the organization, you can create a circle and that's what this system do. You have the system transformation circle. So I've got this my circle since and this is where I can add members. So so far, you've just got coordinate with me. Then I can add people with their wallets, name and wallets or I can send an invite link which is not very not very secure to do that. It's about bringing up people's wallets. And then in there like as you create an epoch I want to I want to read the docs to learn more about that and then she started epoch create a vault I don't even know what that what that does. But you can oh you can actually send Oh, that's if you want to send actual interesting you can send actual funds to that. But I don't know what you can send there. So I don't know if we even need to. Because I don't know if you can send sptrb into this vault or not. Probably no need to do that. So then and then and then this is a part contributions. This is where everyone adds their their contribution. And so you would add here or use add what you've been what you've been working on. And so I can't remember exactly how we did this, but I did have to see benefit but if we added just one thing, I'm just going to add an example thing I just I'm gonna say I made this one so I've got my new thing, so they're gonna let me do it. So that's there. Obviously you add I guess you just add all the different things that you've been working on. And so we've got to have set the scope of what this scope is from. So this is over the course of this of this systems transformation projects. So just, maybe we'll have to we'll have to do this couple iterations. Maybe we'll add one week, wherever it adds their things, another week to review it all. And then we can add more things. If there are things and then then based on everyone's contributions, once the epoch is done, you can do the giving and so the allocations happened during active epochs. Okay, so I guess I could create an epoch I can always cancel it if it's, it's like a it's like the revolution or the period of time that you're that you're okay as I'm reading it like that period of time that you're allocating for. So if I said that the epoch, but there you go, so epoch is a period of time where circle members contribute value, and allocate give tokens to one another. So really, in the future moving for we could have set this up starting it at the beginning of the epoch at the beginning of the project. And then as you go through the projects, you can be out of your contribution as you go along rather than doing it all at the end now where you have to kind of think back for five years, probably the way to do it move forwards and
 
39:41
they have to help each other. Maybe there's a way to, like is there would we have a Google Doc with some of the stuff in there maybe to start brainstorming or do you do that all in here?
 
39:54
We could do maybe it's maybe it's easier to begin with to do that or clarity or Google Doc. Could be could be just a Google doc is frankly just easier, isn't it? Then we also got to decide the timing for this because once the timing is done, and it's done, I don't think you can check. You know, once it's done, it's done. I
 
40:16
remember I messed up the first one and we could fix it.
 
40:19
Yeah. That's okay. And then that's it. Yeah. So So then and then I guess the ones the ones we're in and let's pretend we're in this set wants to set one up and just set a date. end of the month. Yeah. It should be doable, right. We should be able to do it by the end by the end of April. That should be enough time. For 40 1pm Okay, saving so now we're in an epoch. So now I'm in an epoch. Oh, silly me and it started starts from tomorrow. Okay, that was my bad. I can edit it. You can edit it starts from kind of make it go in the past. Oh, there you go. Start it. In the future. Okay. Well, whatever. From tomorrow, you'll be able to go in here and then assign it's going to give and then you'll be able to see your teammates or your teammates here and then you'll be able to give them tokens. So basically how it works is that each person has 100 Give tokens and you can give those tokens to anybody in the team apart from yourself. And then at the end of the epoch, based on the split of the relative split of who has the different numbers of tokens. You then have however many sptrb were just distributing I forget what I forget what the number is, but let's say 25,000 You're just kind of divide that by the by the vote splits, essentially industry but the sptrb Does that make Does that make sense?
 
42:00
And would you be able to because I'd love to capture the center Audrey nine notes. But what do you think this coordinate and this like what does it uniquely enabled towards governance and systems transformation that's different than you know how people may get recognized for contributions
 
42:21
and good questions. I mean, I don't even I'm not 100% certain that this is is this web. Is it completely unique to web three? I think it might be. I guess there's no reason that you could do this. You could do this anyway, you could do this in a classroom. You could do this in a business, couldn't you?
 
42:38
But it's retroactive, right. Like you do the work. And you you hope for the best. I think that the question of anything like it's a really large team, and how do you present you know what you're working on as a value and who values it or who you know what you were saying before, you know to the loudest voices, like someone if someone doesn't say flaunt their work correctly or something, so
 
43:17
there was definitely definitely equity issues with this. It's not a perfect tool, right? Absolutely. Not a perfect tool. You as you said like if someone who someone who who shouts the loudest who's better at better at selling themselves is going to do better on this potentially. And or someone who just has qualities that are less universally recognized somebody's just generally quieter, you know, in life is not is not going to do as well but also like it's any kind of biases that we have, whether it's gender or race, or you know, this this doesn't do anything to guard against those maybe even makes it exacerbates those because, you know, at least in a traditional organization, I'm just gonna say on the flip I'm playing devil's advocate, we're just building on what you're saying, let's see, but the traditional organization, if it's even if it's hierarchical, in theory, the manager has some training and some obligation to try and be equitable, or, you know, has has an HR department or whatever to help them you know, but in here it's absolutely rule of the crowd. You know, if you you could you know, your role of the mob, it could be, but if there's, you know, one person of color and everyone else is not a person of color, and they've got people have got biases or whatever. You can't see where I'm coming from, but I guess it's so so so it's about Part The question is, when is this tool used or how to use this? How do you use this tool? It's certainly not for all situations. Maybe it's only for small teams where there's trust, you know, if there's, you know, that's kind of the assumption that there's small team if there's small teams, and there's there's a degree of trust, which over should be in a small team, then this tool makes sense. When a larger team there's other mechanisms right around bounties, and you know, more combinations of different ways of allocating through proposals. But this is through small teams. I guess there's no reason why you couldn't do this in a small team within a traditional organization. Department. There's no reason why you couldn't what web three enables is that it's so easy to do with tokens because everything is tokenized. And these tokens are free. And there's there's no the tooling is there. It's like talk native tooling. Everyone has a wallet tokens, you know that there's no cheating, it's transparent. It's on chain, it's recorded. So that's what's that's what's unique about it.
 
45:38
Yeah, the technology but the the how is still is still human. I think the other thing too is if there's a way of not making it retroactive if the tasks like if everyone at some point, votes on the tasks that need to be done, and then the tasks are assigned a value. And when you claim that you claim that oh, okay, I did that task, then you get that value. That's another way maybe I don't remember.
 
46:12
Yeah, that's more like the other tradition kind of balance here. The proposal proposal bounty? Model. Hmm.
 
46:23
Okay, well, thank you for helping us figure this out. He knows this will be a fun experiment. And I think you know, even hearing you, I think retroactive is the language that I see retroactive good. Yeah, going back to your point Ash is when I got into the space like public goods retroactive. There's so many things that I didn't understand what it meant until I dig dug a little bit deeper. And I think there's sometimes just an assumption that oh, yeah, people get what that is. But it's new. It's new language. It's new. Like maybe it's part of spaces. I'm just not part of but in the philanthropy world, it doesn't come up as much. And so definitely, like crypto alternative society was super helpful with that, but it's just interesting to think about all the things that I'm like, Yeah, I remember hearing that for the first time going.
 
47:21
I think maybe that's the first time I've used it. And
 
47:26
I was impressed. Thank you. Oh, dear. Well, anything I know. Yeah, we were going to finish up a little bit ago, but but maybe what we could do is set our next meeting. Let me double check about what that is. And just say like, you know, can we get as many people as we can get to the next meeting so we can like talk about closing out this cycle or revolution and then kind of talk about where we're going next. And that we're kind of all on the same page, because I'm fine. If people are weaving in and out it's hard to Yeah, to just and then if people want to share an idea they have and what proposal they want, but maybe I can even say in the thread on Super benefit. You're not bringing it forward to get by and like you can, you can do it. Like it's not that's not how this works, but more just to to ideate together if that's what people would like to do. Any other thoughts on next steps?
 
48:37
I love to know just more. So this this marmalade presentation you're doing and then the OTF piece, they're just looking at them. It's really interesting for me I'd love to to know more and if those are you know if there's it those are both super benefit, but also with your personal work or those are purely super
 
49:01
benefits. Well, I put CFCs logo on it because CFC is paying for me to go so I think it's like, like that's the thing about this space is I think that is another part that gets confusing is that some like I think some people are showing up into the space and this is their livelihood and then other people, you know you're exploring it and then what's equitable about that. So even thinking about the coordinate, I have a tendency to think there should be less coming my way because I have some an organization backing me if you know, so it's a good question. So for the purposes of that, I'm saying it's super benefit and CFC.
 
49:43
Yeah, because I've just like some ideas if, if those are things you're still trying to flush out. I'd love to chat further about a few things that came up. And
 
49:53
even like the interesting marmalade they sent it and they first put CFCs logo in the Eventbrite and then I went back and I'm like, no, no, no, like this should be super benefit because it's mostly they're, like contribution to how this is. So so as I presented I'll, I'll present it more super benefit ish, if you will, because and give the credit to those folks who've helped to be creating it. So. Okay, well, this was fun. I feel Yeah. Feeling good boat some of what we're we landed today. I find I had to read the notes last time so that I could come back to today and remember, where are we in this journey? But I feel like sighted to kind of think about how we might where we might go next. So feel free to put any questions or note in either of those documents and great to have you back and great to have you come back Lindsay and Heenal always fun to riff with you and you're always game to try something new. So thanks for coordinating.
 
50:58
My pleasure. My pleasure. Okay, everyone, tonight Michelle. Thank you

-  
- 00:09
- today's Tuesday, right? Yeah, somebody's in the wrong. Somebody's going into a meeting that starts tomorrow. So it shows up. I'm like, wait a minute. Am I supposed to be in two places at once? So in joke he's still in Kenya so she is not going to be joining us. But I'm gonna pop her amazing blog in the chat just in case you've missed it. Today that was posted about web three and Systems Transformation and a lot about her personal journey. And I think we have somebody else new today. So I was just trying to kind of wait till Lindsay gets here so we can do some introduction. Susie Kavanaugh is at an appointment so it's hoping to hop on by phone. And there's Lindsey right there. Perfect. We'll do some good introductions. And I'm oh, I'll just wait till once he's here. Hi, Lindsay. Welcome. Well, thanks. I was just about to share. We're gonna do some introductions and a proper hello. But I am using otter AI as a way to try to capture notes these days. And so just to give you a heads up, why there's two Michels and yeah, excited that we have two new folks and kind of sharing where some of our typical folks are ones in Kenya wins in an appointment. And Nate might still end up coming. But Heenal and I have been at this right from the beginning and can give some good context today. So but what if we start with some introductions and maybe a little bit about yourself and why you showed up to a web three and Systems Transformation call? And maybe he and I'll come to you last to give a bit of context from your perspective, but the work we've been doing and, and so, Tim, do you want to kick us off?
-  
- 02:06
- Sure, I can do that. Probably because I am the furthest along in my day. So I'm in Germany, it's 9pm.
-  
- 02:14
- Okay, just hold on one second. I'm gonna just welcome Nate and then I'm going to tell him, we're doing introductions so that he knows what we're doing. Okay, let me see here. Hi, Nate.
-  
- 02:26
- Welcome.
-  
- 02:29
- We we have two new folks today, Nate, Tim and Lindsey. And so we're just going to do some introductions about who they are and why they showed up to a web three and Systems Transformation call. So Tim and I met through in jokey and and jokey will come back to us, Lindsey and I just met this morning, and well, last year she is so back to you, Tim in Germany.
-  
- 02:54
- Sure. Yeah. So Tim, based in Germany, I've been working in large corporate for more than 20 years, figured I wanted to do something different. Started working with small family companies, which was very different because I enjoyed the perspective owners have the responsibility they take for families and the world around them. The things they're concerned with saying that they don't care about money, but they want to make sure there's still some fun of the work left. By the time they're great, grand grand, right children are spending all the money they made and I found that inspiring so I started my own company, official birthday it is today wicked it was it was founded on January 23, which is 123. And I figured the official launch date should be today because it's three to one. It's called the White Rabbit. So it's three to one the rabbit is out of the hat. Yeah. And I love driving meaningful transformations in large organizations, small organizations, wherever it matters. I like to spin a few big wheels. In the 56 years I have remaining I plan to become 100 years old at some point of time was my birthday last week. 44 two kids separated because my wife decided she wanted to live with somebody else. Which is cool. My kids are 13 and 15. And I have a magic dog that's sleeping already. Oh,
-  
- 04:26
- great. Congrats. Great to have you here. And I'm sure we'll get to know more about you and White Rabbit and congrats. That's very cool. Maybe Did you share like Yeah, anything else you want to add layer in about why you showed up to this particular call today?
-  
- 04:44
- Um, well, we had a conversation and then joking I had a conversation and I think foundations and anything who is close to governments and political systems is a really interesting access route to spinning some of those big wheels that I've spoken about and then given that your concern and looking into systems change. I'm super open I only work two days a week. Because that earns me enough money. So the remaining five days in the week I do whatever I please. And this might be something I might enjoy. So that's why I'm here. Okay, awesome.
-  
- 05:17
- Lindsey, how about you? Sure.
-  
- 05:22
- So my background is in nonprofit fundraising. I've been I was doing that for over a decade and then got into crypto and web three. Oh, and I'm in Canada, just outside Toronto. So I ended up working at the giving block. I'm not sure if all of you know that. So that's really you know, working directly with all these nonprofits, getting crypto donations, but it still is very centralized. You know, what is web two company really it's a SASS company. So unfortunately, just last week, market dynamics and such. They had to do a lot of layoffs, including me. So that is how so one of our connections introduce Michelle and I and then we realized we were actually already connected because it's a three but yet, so I'm just looking at sort of what my next thing I love the idea of crypto for nonprofits, but really going deeper into that, like do nonprofits even need to exist, you know, are Dows the way What are new funding models? And then Michelle told me about this and I'm like, Well, that is exactly everything I love. So I want to just jump in, see how I can participate. See how I can you know help move things along. So I'm still you know, reading all the intros, processing it but ya know, I saw like this the one chart that it was like the areas of systems and like it just blew my mind Hogan I'm like this is I didn't understand that like my whole life. You know, in a lot of things in work that were at the top I can't remember is like the areas of leverage or something. You guys know what I'm talking about. I only wrote it, you know, but I was like, this is like we're working in the top area. And just like pushing, pushing, you know, the needle forward board, and I want to work in that bottom area of like, oh, yeah, that's the one. That it's like paradigm shifts. And that's where I've always been like, hey, like, we need to shift paradigms. And they're like, Oh, we just need to raise like $6,000 to do this thing. So love just the idea of being amongst people who also like that's where we want to work
-  
- 07:41
- in those sort of paradigm shifting ideas. So oh,
-  
- 07:48
- Heenal Do you want to share a little bit about yourself? And then yeah, where like, what makes you show up in a little of the journey? And then Nate, I'll ask you to do the same with that. So right and I'm just putting in the figma board here that we've been capturing some of this. And Nate I'm trying otter AI. So if you haven't been on meeting with me, that's why I'm
-  
- 08:09
- doing that. Heenal
-  
- 08:13
- Oh, yeah. So Well, thanks so much, Tim and Lindsey for those introductions for showing up today. It's really cool to see you. I don't know if I can do this briefly. But name is Hey, take a bit of time. Yeah. My name my name is Heenal. I'm originally from London, England or there abouts. I now live in London, Canada. I left England 14 years ago to go travel and travel a bit in Latin America. ended up living in Guatemala for four years, which is where I met my now wife in 2012. And we had a long distance relationship for a while and moved to Canada in 2017 2017 2017, six years ago, and most my background was my work experience has been in previous I was in the union movement in England and I traveled and had a social enterprise to be ran in Guatemala, moved here and I'm very much in in the environmental movement. So my wife and I were in a package free grocery store, in our in our day jobs, I suppose. And I'm involved with organizing an Earth Day festival here called Earth fest. And while else I have two stepkids, who are 13 and 15, actually, and I have two, two little girls who are three and five, and so we're busy, busy family, I'm definitely somebody takes on a lot of different projects, but but in terms of my web three journey, which is probably the more interesting part, I kind of about around I think it was around two years ago that I've kind of started in my web three exploratory journey, kind of read an article about NF T's and then just went down the rabbit hole and ended up buying different coins and losing money and doing you know, overleveraged myself, but, you know, all the other things that you know, he was definitely yeah and then, but I was just like, I think I saw the possibilities and I think Dallas resonated with me from the get go because I've been very into like, I guess it might be in between Guatemala and Canada days. What I was really into was working with different kinds of governance systems and distributed decision making and different kinds of participatory leadership. And lot of these things were very difficult to do at scale. I saw the potential of Dallas for enabling people to do that. I started seeing you know, in my, in my work in the nonprofit and social enterprise world, how the current systems are so broken and clearly need new ones. And clearly we know how to do it because humans are smart, and I do think that humans can figure things out. And so it seemed ripe and then got connected. Kind of by chance with super benefit through through Michelle and Michelle and I know each other from London, through the nonprofit work here, although we've never really worked together, actually, like together on a thing we've seen or knew each other. We didn't never work together until Super benefit, which I guess was about a year and a half ago. And I was just attracted by the vision of like, how do we these emerging technologies, how can these be be used for system change? Right and how can they you know what I guess but also like, what are the what are the potentials for good and for bad at the technologies and how do we ensure that this shift that's that's happening whether we like it or not, isn't just co opted the way that web two was co opted into capitalist infrastructure of how we concentrate my wealth, which there's definitely a lot of people out there who that's what they're trying to do. In Web three is make more money and concentrate more power and wealth. And so I think one of the initial queries we had in in Super benefit was was how do we onboard more people into web three who were from the social justice and not for profit sectors, so that we can bring those voices into the conversations that are happening because there's a well there's a couple different things happening in the web one, there's people who are in it clearly for just selfish motives, and they're okay with that. But then there's people who are in it with good intentions, but they don't really know what they're doing. Because they've come from this tech and tech world or finance world, or they just, you know, whereas there's, there's people who have been in the change, world change making well for decades, who are not represented here in web three. And like, you know, Michelle is probably like a rare exception right to that of, but how do we so the idea was, how do we, how can we onboard more people and we just so that's what we try to do every bit I think we realized that it's very hard to do that. And it's still very hard and we kind of say we gave up but we kind of put that on the back burner, because we realize now in the learning curve is so steep, and it's not like just the learning curve is so steep, we don't really have How do we show people what the benefits you know, there's not like there's like this learning curve and then these are these Bendtner these benefits. It's not clear to people so I think we kind of took a step back from that. And then then we started investigating Well, what are you know, what is the impact that we can have like like defining it and getting clear on it and that was part of this system transformation projects. Among this the other several other projects in Super benefit that we could talk about that are really quite interrelated around the governance, exploration on governance systems. This was what we started this and transformation project, I think, was really looking at what's out there in the web three world and looking at the transfer transformation potential, trying to create a framework. The original idea was creating a repository of projects or things like that. We realize that's not really the things are changing so much and it doesn't actually help move the movement forward to just have a big list or database of things. You know, that's not really an it takes, you know, a lot of capacity. But one of the so so so I guess, you know, this project is a little bit of it is at a crossroads of like we've kind of got this body of research that we've done, and we're figuring out what what we do without which direction we go next. But one of the things as well that we're doing super and I'm jumping, jumping around a little bit, but it's all connected is one of the things that we're doing and super benefit is how do we put these this theory into action? It's like, so we're very small group of people, right, and everyone's doing this in their spare time like nobody nobody's paid or anything is like it's like literally busy people doing this in this kind of time. Because it's something we believe in. And it's like, how do we how can we how can we put some of these ideas into into action like how can we experiment how can we do an experiment with different way of operating what would traditionally be a nonprofit or charity? Can we do it in a different way and then just just you know, learn by doing learn by doing and show by doing and that's what this was all in for sport experiment is represents, and I don't know how much the two of you know about it, but I'll leave it leave that part there. And if we want, you can definitely talk more about all over the sport. So I'm excited about that. It's like the doing thing, but there's also the opportunity potentially, you know, with with with other talking to other charities, nonprofits about what we're doing, but it's hard to do hard to talk about and it's I think it's one of the things you kind of got to do. And so I think that's part of the kind of tent the tension that we have. Now in the in this project. It's like the best of the doing versus the telling side of things and yeah. Curious, curious how that how that how that lands, how that resonates. And I'll leave it there and pass it on tonight.

- 15:38
- I will try to sum up as well. Yes, I like my my background is very bizarre and all over the place, but as a lot of people I feel like are I went from like being a film major undergrad to two working like on the ground nonprofit kind of work, to heading into the fitness world and the long distance trail running world for quite a while, which somehow led me to business school, which is where which is where I learned about web three. And and we really through like doing that impact entrepreneurship project kind of turned me into the potential for for impact through web three tools and so that the more I learned, the more I just went down the rabbit hole and was like, I gotta get involved in this dowel web three world and then getting deeply involved. I realized how far we still had to go. And how like these these dowels are really very, some of them very centralized. And, you know, the Democratic voting mechanisms sort of, you know, not truly baked into the infrastructure of the dam as much as just like a signaling thing to the centralized courtroom. In many cases, not all but yes. All along the way or in along my web feed journey. I got involved in crypto culture and society. It's like a learning Dao. And that's the second semester I volunteered like I really want to look into this social impact and web three area. So I organized a a learning experience, which is where you know and Michelle, and then recently we did another learning experience around systems transformation where they we all work together, bringing in different speakers around that. And yeah, since then, been trying to get a little more involved in Super benefit coming to these things every week. And yeah, excited to see where we go. It feels very uncertain, and we're figuring things out as we go. But I've really appreciated how much like super benefit has expanded my thinking or like pushed my thinking in different ways. So yeah, that's well, that's Thank
-  
- 18:15
- you. And I've met you both. So I don't know if I have to do much of an introduction, except for to say maybe. Yeah, I just yeah, I'm always excited to be meeting new people. And just do think this space is really like we're at an interesting point. So your timing of coming into this moment is perfect, because we're in a bit of a yeah, just sensemaking trying to figure out where we might go next. And I've had a lot of ideas and I think in the spirit of working within the the governance sell model, we're considered it like, you know, a cell of the cell model. And so, so we're, we're testing out some of the governance even by the way that we show up in that, you know, I think we've been trying to source how we're going like, where do we want to go next, but there's also an opportunity that some may go in some different threads, and we'll see. Yeah, we'll see where that where that all leads. I did put a link to the web three and Systems Transformation framework, which gives you a bit of a pulse of where we've been, and then even the article that I put in that in jokey wrote has a little bit of it in there. And then the figma board, if I was trying to summarize the last few weeks, which have been, I think, Nate Heenal, and I've been pretty consistent with you know, we've we've been, like wondered Oh, should we be using the Sustainable Development Goals? SDGs there was some work around medical crisis. And we're like, the conversations often are coming back to, you know, how do we work within some of these and this is what Lindsay and I chatted about today within some of these legacy, like kind of long term institutions. And are we trying to bridge those? Are we trying to shift those? Are we trying to build a new and so with the framework that we're that we're looking at, I think we're kind of at a bit of a pivot point to say where do we want to go? Next? We did host the Dow's and philanthropy session last week with three Canadian foundations. And Susie had put it in the Super benefit today, but Susie had shared like a kind of an interesting web three futures immersion opportunity that I think is originating out of the UK where they're bringing five charities together. So I think there's, you know, some energy around some different ways that this could go and that, you know, if I was trying to summarize how I'm coming to this today is to realize, like when we're in all in for sport, when we're in the governance, sell meetings, all of that is the bigger ship systems transformation. And, in some ways, like, you know, is there a way to maybe we've been documenting it so Heenal One of his how I started because as a poetic harvester, so when we did the web three and Systems Transformation, he was capturing that he, we've got the talent of our, like, video friend here with me, like there's lots of storytelling tools that we have, and I think it's just trying to figure out like, where is the how are we documenting this journey and jokey did it with her blog? So people are trying to, you know, bring those different perspectives. And so yeah, so for the rest of the time we have today I think it's just really exploring. You know how we want to show up together and make sense and I know Suzy and in jokey have some dream of something that they're interested in creating, and and they might bring a proposal forward, but I couldn't articulate it very well because I yeah, I think they would do more justice. But maybe I'll just pause there and say to Lindsey, and Tim, what's showing up for you? What questions do you have for the three of us? What do you need in order to feel like you're
-  
- 22:26
- somewhat caught up? So I have a question just so this group here is this.
-  
- 22:33
- Like this? The system transformation group, so there's like multiple groups, this one new or you've been meeting in this?
-  
- 22:41
- We've been going at this for a while. I don't even know how long to be honest. I'd have to look at all look at when the proposal was posted. And I can post or if clarity? I don't know. Actually, I'd have to figure out how to share that one. The proposal. Yeah.
-  
- 22:59
- You first share from a snapshot?
-  
- 23:02
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's a good point.
-  
- 23:04
- So this link I just dropped in system transmission. This is kind of the I don't know when the sales but this is when we first the first offering that we did, but we can share the snapshot. So that was kind of November feel like a really long time ago. Was that really November? It was in November, was it I mean, November.
-  
- 23:22
- It feels like I've been at this for a long time. But that's a long time we went through well, don't hold us accountable to what we said in this proposal, because it's not what we're doing anymore. Okay, yeah, but hear this. You got it.
-  
- 23:36
- I got I got the link if you want it. Yeah,
-  
- 23:38
- I got it in there. Now.
-  
- 23:40
- I'm sorry, how crypto culture and society is a different
-  
- 23:44
- dough. Yes. Yeah. And then we're Yeah, we're connected to that. And yeah, I can put there they have an amazing if you know anybody new to web three, they got a great starter pack and then Heenal also created an amazing one for Super benefit. Well, I guess, Nate and I and others helped with that. But But yeah, so there's some crypto culture and societies and a little bit of a rebuild, rethink where it's going next but that's where the web three systems transformation web three social impact started.
-  
- 24:23
- Just like a lot, I'll
-  
- 24:24
- just need to absorb. Yeah,
-  
- 24:26
- I don't blame you. Since we
-  
- 24:29
- just learned about this this morning.
-  
- 24:31
- Yeah, exactly. Tim, how about you because you I know you've been exploring systems frameworks as well.
-  
- 24:39
- Yeah, I come more from the system side. So I hold a lecturer for a Swiss University and systemic was systems design and systemic thinking and then from my background, NATO's funny when you said you have a kind of a interesting history. I used to be in it for 12 years and I did everything from plugging network cables to, you know, asking people whether they had restarted to be in a CIO for one of the businesses in GE and then I figured it's not about technology, it's about strategy. And then I ran corporate strategy in GE for a little while, until I had figured out it's not strategy, it's the people and then I went into organizational development and and everything about philosophy and psychology. So cognitive, neural, and philosophy. So I would get along with people and from all that, I distilled the system, so I am very much interested in a completely different aspect of 3.0 which is AI, not crypto. I don't blame me but despise everything that is capital. I have too many, too many people I know that are rich and unsensible. And then I'd really and that look into crypto as a means of accumulating more capital. I think you said it very nicely. I also do not enjoy the the suck up effect where it kind of like a what do you call it like a chain that trades a lot of suction on the bottom and a lot of accumulation on the top, which is what we're seeing in capital, which I feel was very much accelerated in crypto, where people made tons of money without creating any value whatsoever. So what I am interested in is, what is the coexistence between between man and machine? How can I create cognitive capacity by laying off a lot of my thinking work to machine and accelerate how data is getting processed or how I get to be intelligent about stuff. So it's all about intelligence, really, and the difference between intelligence and wisdom? Because I think machines can be intelligent, but they can never have wisdom. So they're incapable of combining two things in a meaningful way they can if they create a lot of combinations, something might come out that makes sense, but gauge the gauge on that is always human. So whether a combination of two previously independent things make sense in combination is is up to a human to judge. And that's what I'm interested in. So how do we use computers to have computers do what they do really well and fast, which is crunching a lot of data and doing mathematical operations? And how do we leverage humans to be intelligent and full of wisdom or knowledge that creates value? That's my focus on that 3.0 Maybe a little different compared to what is what is very visible? Because I feel most people have a real challenge in in being super productive in collaborating with a machine and not challenged by that. The best example I probably have is if I drive my car, it becomes a real symbiotic relationship that I uncovered with a friend recently. We both drive Tesla's and the question was, how much do you actually look out of the windshield? And how much do you look on the screen? We figured that from our perception, we both look at the screen like 80% of the time because the machine observes the street, we observe the machine so the cognitive load of gauging what's going on on the outside is with a machine. So they become the system to on a system one observing the environment. If you think about Kahneman, system one system two and we use our system to to observe the machine that is the system one which creates a lot of cognitive surplus. So if I look at how strenuous do I feel a long range drive of three, four or five or eight hours compared to the old cars I had very less strenuous if I look at how I can create value using Chet GPT for customers not to charge money for something that GPT wrote, but to create epistemology with them to make them understand something in in easier verbiage. All of these things create massive cognitive surplus and capacity. It's probably why I only work two days a week because I lay off most of the work to a machine. I still charge quite nicely for those two days. So that pays all the bills and more. But it creates that surplus and I'm wondering what would happen if more humans would understand that and if we had a better understanding of the potential and the possibility that's that's sitting inside of there because with the advent of what do you call it? In English? Ah, good another native speaker. I'm German and my parents didn't even speak a sacred language. So sometimes it's a bit difficult. The Age of Enlightenment. That's it. Because before the enlightenment, people were convinced everything could only get worse. Over time, and everything was scars. I think we live really in a time of abundance and things could get better and for everyone, that's also hard drive my business. I want everyone to win. And to have some fun out of it. I think that's a paradigm shift that gets enabled by by 3.0. Maybe also by crypto. I'm not saying it doesn't. I just don't see it because it's not a space. I am wasting or investing my time and I gave a 10% share of my company to my daughter's Godfather who happens to be a tax consultant. So he does all the boring bullshit. Here's a copy that's called the Black rabbit. And I have the White Rabbit and then there's a holding company that's called the rabbit hole. That's That's how we roll and that's how I want to drive stuff. And I think web three is really unique in that perspective.
-  
- 31:07
- Welcome, Susie.
-  
- 31:11
- I think you might be in transit, but we have two new folks today, Lindsay and Tim. So we were somewhat getting them up to speed. So yes, you're in transit. So in listening mode, great to have you here. So I guess a couple things that come to mind and others jump in. But one is that when Yeah, when we're coming to this work when I had mentioned this to Lindsey today, but maybe not to Tim, is that we're realizing there's the systems transformation work. And then there's what does web three uniquely enable? And so we've kind of had an aha recently that a lot of what you see in the figma board is a lot of the system's transformation, like kind of us philosophies and approaches over the over time and we're now trying to zero a little bit more into what does web three uniquely enable and then the other thing that comes to mind is just lots of dialogue and important dialogue around equity and sovereignty and what how does that play into this particular work and, and how are we being really intentional about that as we kind of move forward and knowing that like, I'm trying to think of a good example, an example early on in web three, where we kind of showed where entity thinking crept in, as we talked about invitations, and we realized when you invite somebody in, it's kind of like somebody's in somebody's eye as if we like we've had really trying to shift to less the super benefit as a as a thing, or, you know, an entity but more as a network that's porous and is all of us creating rather than whoever was there a long time ago. So I share that because this is shifting and evolving as new folks come in. I know Suzy you can't make maybe you want to put in the chat but I know when I met within Jocie recently, she said that you to have something you're excited about potentially putting forward as a proposal down the road so I don't know if you need more time for that. To think on that or if there is something you want to plant the seed on. But I think because we're in this pivot point, any kind of direction that people are excited about would be helpful, but any other kind of comments or reflections while we wait to see if Susie's gonna, I found that
-  
- 33:37
- interesting what you're saying and realizing I already have that in my mind. You know, it's like I'm joining something. And I know it's a doubt I know it's decentralized, but I'm also like, Oh, I'm just joining so these are the people who run it. Like just getting that out of my head. Yeah, you know, if I join I am equal and I can participate. Obviously I want to look at what's been done and understand you know, what, what has already been done, but what that knowing like, I don't have to ask permission to to participate. That's something that you know, hopefully I can make those shifts and myself quickly.
-  
- 34:18
- Yeah, thank you. That's I with you, when I'm joining new things i i show up and that's mind bend. She'll let an NGO key share it to be here. I'm curious about language and in use instead of invitation. We use instead of invitation. What how did we start writing that
-  
- 34:42
- shifted initially like in our initial mirror posts we talked about in with invitation, which is just something I invite imitate inviting people into these seven different areas, eight different areas of exploration. And we shifted it into thinking of instead of inviting people but these are our intervention areas. So these the areas and rather it like invitation, it's just it's just a reframing, it's not even about necessarily about the language, it's about the in in the out and it comes up. It comes up it's this kind of the entity thinking it's so embedded in us there was one you shared Michelle last week or something when you said about you tweeted on Twitter spaces come and join us. It sounds innocent. Come and join us with like, Ha, actually there's just like this completely, like any kid will say that but it's so embedded in us. It's like that us and them, right. It's like rather than it's just you know, come and participate right coming in. It's different it seems similar, but it's like that that subtle framing of the entity, the entities that are in one way or the boundaries and and yeah, that's that's, that's that's that's I don't know if that helps, but um yeah, I think for me as well, Tim, just to fudge to respond a little bit to one of the one of the things you said and thanks for sharing everything that in terms of like the crypto is not really the interesting part although it does is interesting but that's not why I'm why I'm here at all, I would say like even within super benefit. It's not really something we really even really talk about. It's like it's just we're doing this as well. It's more like the Dow the Dow aspect, right? So the Dow aspects and you know, NF T's were part of that in a small way in the sense of what they give the kind of the badging that and then the governance rights and things that go along with the NFT is not about like speculating on on some JPEGs you know, that's not what it's about. But it's about some of these and then we talk about some of the unique features of web three that we're still really trying, you know, we're kind of breaking them down but in terms of the wallets and the identity and decentralization and even like just just just I'm gonna raise this point, but with what we've done mostly we but the governance cell within an Olympic sport has done in the way that all infra sport has been spun up and not the way that super benefit was it super benefit started as like a core group of people a general circle and then we tried to decentralize from there was all over sport. It's really been completely senseless from from from day one. So it's like it's the difference between decentralized and actually centerless sense of us governance. So it's, I don't know other people I'm really done much research into, but I don't think there's many other people that are talking about develop that that thinking and that those frameworks for sensorless governance in the way that that super benefit and or like a small house. So I think that's something that's really unique. And it's not that, you know, it's not without its challenges, and we're just we're taking that small kind of taking it slowly and we're figuring it out as we go along. And really thinking it through. But I think that's the part that's exciting for me, I think about if you can do that, uh, the idea is that you can do that at a global level, you know, shouldn't the wealth be that way? And then you don't need any intermediaries whether because there's always intermediaries and it's not just government, governments and institutions, but even companies, families, right, there's all these like, actual like mini institutions that you know, not saying they don't have that function, but but is there a better way of doing these things? You know, is there a more fluid way a more organic way of relating and and so it's like there's a there's a mindset shift that has to happen as well as a technological shift and economic political social shift, but But it's like, that's why it's an experiment. You know, can we do this within you know, in the experiment, and if it's a good experiment, and other people want to work on it, kind of want to experiment with us. So that's kind of that's kind of what's alive, alive for me. I don't know if that answers anything.
-  
- 38:42
- Yeah, maybe just the experiments language stood out to me that the all in for sport is, you know, a bit of a governance experiment. I mentioned to Lindsay earlier that we have a transformation mapping with Kronos that's, you know, really looking at the future of sport and kind of make creating that long term vision. And then we have the systems transformation work and, you know, there's like, yeah, just seeing some of this is really early stage exploration. So yeah, so I guess like, we are with a bit of time so the I think these are scheduled, I can't remember 45 minutes to an hour, but do we want to need any updates from you on the blog or, like you had a real desire potentially, to explore the SDG thread? Is there anything any updates from your mind? And sensemaking?
-  
- 39:38
- No, I'm gonna I'm gonna really try and get to that draft of the blog soon. And I need to otherwise I will never do it. And I was recently just thinking like, I wonder if the blog could actually be a video but I'm not sure in the best form. That's more work, more work, but it could be interesting, but
-  
- 40:02
- cool. Okay. Well, I'm excited to read it whenever you're ready. And yeah, I think that's cool. And then
-  
- 40:09
- the SDGs Yeah, I I still think it's interesting. I want to go back and look at it again. But, but yeah, maybe. I mean, it's kind of it feels daunting, because there's so many SDGs and because yeah, that makes it feel daunting. I think, like, if, if we were looking at just how web three addresses no poverty, or one of one of them, like it feels to me more like okay, I can start to wrap my head around that and we're, you know, climate or whatever, whatever it is, but there's just so many of them. It's hard to really do that.
-  
- 40:53
- I don't know if because I don't know exactly what you're working on. But it's something with when I was at the giving block because we worked with 2000 nonprofits have every mission and focus so I did had to think a lot because I was working with strategy for them on how do you know did that particular mission intersect with, you know, crypto values, so I don't know if that's something I might have some insight into.
-  
- 41:25
- So you worked with a bunch of nonprofits and tried to think about how it intersected with crypto values?
-  
- 41:32
- Well, basically, so we would like it's a SASS company, right? So they just have a widget and they're trying to fundraise crypto. So we've worked be working with like UNICEF amnesty, St. Jude's like you know Children's Cancer. Friends of bonobo shows Mercy Corps, like all those like the big blue chip ones as well as local like local food bank, so how does you know Community Foundation and a local food bank or something that's working for, you know, kids, like disadvantaged kids or arts or like all basically if you're working with 2000 charities, you're gonna hit every SDG right and, and how did they? Like I would be working with them on how to do they like state their impact, and their mission clearly aligned with crypto values and things like anonymity or decentralization, or like all the values sort of embedded in in crypto donors.
-  
- 42:37
-  
- 42:40
- And yeah, we were chatting today, like, ya know, about some thread around web three and philanthropy and how to bring a bit of, I guess, learning and context to that to that space. I think we're like, just to loop people in that weren't here where we kind of ended at like five minutes before the call ended was the SDGs. Like, we likely like keep some people can relate to them because there's something that has, you know, we're globally created and their framework that has some understanding to them. And then we kind of started talking about them being a legacy framework, and then how do you make sure that in systems transformation, we're trying to have that intersectionality of issues and sometimes the individual SDGs miss that connection point, but I think you know, it can be if there's like a starting point, because really, we're like, Yeah, I think people have to go where they're feeling some some energy. I'm curious if people see a difference in crypto values and web three values. I have a strong reaction to that, but I'm gonna listen.
-  
- 43:52
- I think that was probably because I tend to use that interchangeably like I would talk about a crypto donor and the crypto donor values. I I think I have like a split in crypto so there's the crypto values that are the web three values and then there's the other the moon shots and the you know, when Lambo kind of things, so that is you know, it's a people who are just like speculating and you know, buying shit coins and whatever. That's totally separate when I'm saying like a crypto value that would be to me the same as saying what three values and but I think also within communities, so like a Bitcoin value like Bitcoin Maxy value versus eath you know, like if values or a link marine or whatever. So, looking, there are different values within different communities as well.
-  
- 44:55
- I just wanted to say I'm not even clear what those values are. Right. So to me, it's super difficult to have an opinion on that, because I don't know. But I personally liked the SDGs because I think they, I mean, in my opinion needs look at the SDGs in their entirety, because they're all interconnected. Right? If you look at it, if you have good education, the risk of poverty is different. Not saying it's not there, but it's different. If you're having good health, and you're in the right place, if you're nourished nature and nurture, like all of these things are different lenses and aspects. And what I feel challenged with is that we're probably deeply human in capability of thinking several things at the same time. Most of us were, were tainted by attending school for many years. I probably got lucky, but because I only went there but I was kind of immune to what was taught, or I really learned it in a different fashion. So I think thinking several things at the same time is important and being able to like step out of a situation that's my systems thinking approach and like looking at it from a third tier. So when I look at systems, I distinguish between systems of the First Order which is a human being or a computer system of the second order, which is a relationship between two systems of the first order. So two humans talking or a human working with a machine is assisting with the second order. And then I'm trying to remove myself from the equation, getting to the third order, being able to observe that situation and doing it at the same time. So I might be in a conversation, but also observe it from the outside, which happened because they put the brain in my head the wrong way around, which I came to enjoy quite a bit working with a bunch of psychologists and philosophers to help me make sense of that. So I I think values are the key to driving any transformation. And I think they need to transcend focus on the ego and the individual. And look at the benefit of the larger system, right? The benefit of the planet, which I feel personally the SDGs aligned really well. With, and then my experience is if you do that, and I might have just gotten lucky over the past few months, but the universe reciprocates to an extent, right. So if my approach is I'm happy if everybody else is happy, and I think I've done a good job if everybody else benefits. My benefit. For some reason, unbeknownst to me, becomes auto magical. It just happens. And I just receive what I need. It sounds very esoteric, but I said it has worked a magic treat for the past six months. And that allows me to sustain a very happy life, which is really the goal I have right now have a podcast with my son. The conversation was What are you after when your company is big? So well first of all, what is big? Because it's a one person enterprise with a huge network. And what is the measurement and to me, it's really doing something that's good, mainly for the planet, because then it is good for everyone else, and being happy doing it, which I am. Honestly that's how I would make sense. And that's my values, if you will, I don't know what they align with, if if anything, but it aligns the most with with the SDGs and then I see a certain number of things I would subscribe to so anonymity is something I feel strongly about. But I also believe in in post creation. So being out there is a good way of staying anonymous too. And then if I'm involved in something that's larger than myself, one of the terms I have is I don't want to be known. So like a hacker and maybe that's also a 3.0 thing. I want to get into a system change the system leave the system and now I don't want anyone to know that it was me or I was involved because I want to continue leading a normal life. I want to be out there beyond the street not be recognized. There was a TV once I was recognized afterwards by a few random strangers on the street, I found that deeply confusing and disturbing. Don't want to have that ever again. So that's that's my take on that, but I would be super interested in if there is a list of those values and what they are. Yeah, I'd love to learn about that because I deeply believe in values driving everything we do.
-  
- 49:52
- Well, maybe a couple thoughts on that. I don't think I'd call them values but in that that Systems Transformation framework. I think some of those principles have some values in them and then we do have super benefit. Not that these are web three but when I said I had a reaction, what I realized and I'll just pop these values in the chat that's here, but these are not exhaustive. Was the like I think maybe Lindsey because you worked in crypto philanthropy and you were talking about crypto all the time. My reaction is in part informed by the very thing that's driving me crazy right now that media is actually creating a narrative about something. So I only say web three and blockchain in my conversations, I never use the word crypto. And so it's just an interesting moment for me because your question, Susie has me thinking, okay, so you're like I'm even being influenced by the system of web three and crypto that were like, exploring and experimenting and and yeah, what is it about that? So I don't know. I don't know if others have have a comment to that question that they want to share.
-  
- 51:11
- I think the like branding of crypto web three is evolving things. So like, like, you know, web three, was coined a few years ago on a likewise so was web 3.0. And now it's more web. Anyway. It's all evolving and like, crypto, it related to cryptocurrency I feel like it's currently being reclaimed to be anything related to cryptography, like private public key set like related to a wallet Dows anything like a broader instead of just being related to cryptocurrency, but I don't know these these like definitions and what the values are constantly evolving. And I don't know if I think you just need to define what what specific you know, and there's like subset of Dows you know, that are like aligned around a certain set of values that are different, maybe from the broader un, it's not always clear.
-  
- 52:25
- Well, okay, so we only have a few minutes left, so, so maybe what like as we kind of come back to next week, does anybody have a suggestion around a next step and I am checking in within jokey Susie about this idea, and just the third any shape to that that she wants to to bring forward to this particular group. And yeah, I'll just anything concrete as a next step for folks. Yeah,
-  
- 52:59
- I think it'd be super interesting if we had a concrete challenge that could be tackled. So what I always find it if I recall this if we talked about using principles, but we do so without context. To me personally, at least it becomes difficult, right? So I want to it makes it easier for me because it remains somewhat superficial and theoretical or to meter for myself personally. And I always like to tackle something concrete, like what is it? Like, is there anything we're observing that we want to change? And then we can have perspectives on what is that thing that we would want to drive a change on? And then create ideas and then see whether that's acted to being I opened the values on the other screen? Like, what is it we can do? How can we drive an experiment on that? How can we learn something because that's what my autism is focused on? The the island skill I have is learning anything, everything from anything, and that's at least what I would love to do, but I don't know what the concrete challenge might be but formulating that challenge, and then start to work on that and then distill principles from that. And then take the next challenge and see whether the principles distilled are also applicable to the next challenge.
-  
- 54:34
- I'm just I'm going to pop in the theory of change for Super benefit into the into the chat to any other any other comments.
-  
- 54:42
- I think for me, I just have grabbed all these links. So really, for me, I want to just look read all the stuff look at what's being done before knowing what I could participate in or how I could be helpful.
-  
- 55:05
- Yeah, so take your time,
-  
- 55:07
- but also make the thing you're working on it that is something that the SD GPS, I think it sounds like something that I know having to equate those sort of quickly look at the SDG and how it fits into this crypto web three, space like the the alignment I have done a lot of work now not sure how we connect on Discord or
-  
- 55:35
- Yeah, Discord or you could email me if you prefer email maybe check
-  
- 55:42
- discord I like left discord for a while like got back on and like, again.
-  
- 55:46
- There is and you might have noticed it but on the fig jam there is a an SDG section that Nate and Heenal were working on to do. So maybe for next time we can have you bring forward wherever you are with your blog and we can chat through the SDGs and what else was I gonna mention? And then see what what what in joke he was bringing forward and then I'll just also so I have a presentation tonight at the university I teach called governance Leadership Ethics and I'm doing a bit of a Heenal helped me with these some some of these slides and I'm going to do like a live web three adventure tour and I'm going to try the same thing when I go to Oxford UK shortly. So I'll pop this in here and just I guess an invitation as you're reading things like the web three systems transformation framework, the big jam, any of these things, maybe not the slides, maybe send me an email because I'm going live with them tonight, but, but certainly feel free to add any thoughts like what questions are coming up for you your own input feel like they're interactive opportunities, for sure. And those are my draft slides that I'm still working through. And yeah, well this is fun, fun to have new energy. And yeah, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And Susie just because she didn't get a chance to introduce herself. She runs a web three Thursday's Twitter spaces on Twitter. So check that out. Hashtag web, three Thursdays. And, yeah, really cool. Cool stuff that's being shared there. And then this concept around the charity immersion. While it's it's UK based, so we couldn't apply to it, but it could be interesting to think about offering something like that as a potential next step as well with a bit more of the system's perspective to it. Because I think the charity nonprofit space right now and impact hours, I don't think is getting into the intersectionality yet in the system's level stuff. So there could be an experiment in there as well as a group. So Okey dokey Yeah. So yeah, let's keep noodling and we'll see you but and we haven't. I'm not sure if you have the super benefit discord but we have a channel and discord and super benefit so you can add any resources, anything that's coming up for you I'll just pop that link if you want to come in there. And it's totally optional. No, no pressure. And then I think the experiment if you're at all interested in sports, we're looking for new people for all in for sport, and we're going to be doing a get cap coin round in April. So definitely wanting to bring like a really good equity lens and yeah, holding each other accountable and kind of nudging in lots of ways is also, I think, something that we're trying to create the space for. Oh Heenal was ahead of me. Okay, well have a beautiful rest of your day, evening morning wherever you are. And if you're interested in still have 15 minutes okay, so
- 
- Yes, that sounds interesting.

- SDGs framework discussion - discussed approach, using legacy frameworks
	- Michelle shared systems transformation model for CFC
	- Intersectionality of issues/opportunities came up and SDGs don't capture the overlapping element of systems - @heenal sent this as follow up 
	- his kind of relates to what we were talking about at today's meeting. Maybe a framing around the metacrisis is more appealing/powerful/valuable than framing around the SDGs?  It's an interesting wiki to browse around anyway [https://wiki.metacrisisdao.com/Daniel%27s+prompts+from+GreenPill+84](https://wiki.metacrisisdao.com/Daniel%27s+prompts+from+GreenPill+84)

# Feb 28, 2023
- Nate, Heenal, Susie,
- Updates:
	- Nate is working away on the blog post. Got structure, now fleshing it out
- Recap:
	- key question to explore: **what does web3 uniquely enable that has not been possible before?**
	- break it down: "what does web3 enable for x...." (climate, education, inequality, music, art, gaming, etc)
- Idea - use the SDG framework and analyze how web3 can uniquely enable transformation in each of these SDGs
	- And at the end: what does this analysis teach us about the SDGs and what is missing?
- idea - matrix.....


# Feb 21, 2023
- Attendees: Michelle, Steve, Heenal, Rowan, Michael, Nate
- Check in and updates:
- more interested in what we will do and not definitions
- clarify the purpose  of document 
- Steve W - emphasize the transformative potential and realizing the potential, and take on interventions that will focus on the quality of that - 
- Heenal R - don't need to go out for more feedback, what is toolkit/practices, what is action for next phase - identify the practices so that it can act as a resource/guide for the landscapes and how are they experimenting at the different levels
- Next phase - pivot moment - see what emerge 
- Nate - trying to write something that they will connect with and draw interest -
- Three sub topic of DAO cell - climate transformation, race/equity transformation, future of work transformation - could draw people not interested in overall systems concept 
- Consultation for DAOs doing different work as another idea
- Steve W - does not feel has good sense of web3 but more of the potentiality - field emergence, that is very active that can find of value
- conflating transformation and web3 - web3 enables and brings new patterns, actions, configurations that is missing in the ecosystem - what does it enable that is new in pursuit of transformation
- we get stuck evaluating one DAO (entity thinking) - is it transformative and difficult to pull anything clear and can't tell a better transformative nature
- what can we bring in a proactive way - transformation mapping/pathways/purpose - that orientation could be valuable for communities lookign to apply those transformation aims - concrete service
- DAO Primitive - Rowan AIFS - pulling together the organizing primtiives and intiatiting for a formative comunity and address transformation at larger scale - templatable that is tool agnostic which encacpsuates why web3 is helpful 
- Toolkit - how technologies are useful that was not possible before - inspiration library - valuable and unexplored 
- Could be done towards a transformation agenda/system similar to what Nate suggested
- Not that we don't have resources more the vision that is lacking 
- web3 as though it is disembodied - how do we change this issue and what is web3 role to change it - strategic position and lessons from AIFS and how do we document and draw that out
- what is web3 contribution to the transformation aspiration - **what does it uniquely enable that has not been possible before**
- Who will be the stakeholder and voice of the aspiration? Collaboration/coalition within sport - role of developing the voice 
- What are roles in the transformation system - DAO primitive work is one example 
- Bringing together of a purpose with a high **leverage** opportunity- if we can get this mechanism where stakeholders already participating it will release mass amounts of scale and possibility 
- “A mechanism that can release energy and value” “can feel it” <- this is really super on point. That’s kind of what the search is for, feeling around to find the mechanism to unlock the value.
- The process itself is not an innovation - but that it will be done for a dao, through a dao partnership, is what becomes a model
- why blockchain matters and DAOs organized around them - how this might be able to harness web3 - if you don't start with it at the beginning and only seen as a tool
- DAO primitive - coordination approaches that leverage the basics of what technology allows us to do and runs on these mechanisms of how to coordinate differently 
- systems that substantiate the values not the individual values
- an approach to coordination that is materially different that has comes from what the tools enable, that can be scaled - decision making and how decisions come forward
	- where are these patterns existing, and what seeing in web3 (those patterns can be supported in other ways), if we can articulate the patterns 
	- values are an absolute animator, what we meant for the future we wanted to enable, web3 is infrastructure is a way for that to happen
	- word tools confusing, maybe where we started with infrastructure better articulates coordination of "technologies"
	- Music industry as an example - tools, movement

Web3 provides an infrastructure for transformation that honors x values at a very large scale and great facility.
- That provision is itself transformational in terms of…


What are examples of how these practices and technologies allow that to happen
- how does that play out and actually make the network stronger and fairer and enable people to make better decisions
- that is exactly what the “cases” were aimed to provide…how does it actually work. - what are examples of each of the intentions and practices
- Goal/Purpose - and how do you start in ways that aligned/
- Cases of applications of web3 that illustrate its unique potential - not about the DAO/Org that created it. This is where we get stuck - framing things around the org/initiative.
- who decides the authority and to propose and decide and maintain the coherence of that network -formation of cell working groups - community and operation level 
- Steve W - finance innovation -

- Check-in & updates
	- Susie: Has been thinking about how to present all the info we have on the Figjam board in a more digestible format - tweets and/or poetic harvest, or....?
	- Steve: Strong on transformation area, weaker in the technology part. Has been working on a two-page doc about his ideas/vision for where this project could go
	- Itamar: "people nerd". tech background. experience with org design and system design. bankless DAO - dash project. First week as part of SuperBenefit, attending as many calls as possible to get a flavour of what's going on.
- Draft post summarizing the journey of this project: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d_zpiPIXggk5_7EUHBuVn4fDuhMFIBygDCamFCecNPk/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d_zpiPIXggk5_7EUHBuVn4fDuhMFIBygDCamFCecNPk/edit) 
	- Now what? Where do we go from here?
	- Nate, Njoki, Heenal, Steve - all doing personal blog posts/reflections
	- what does web3 in particular provides the ability for in contrast to non-web interactions  
	- so far exploration has been about what is systems transformation 
	- what are the particular practices that are possibly and potentiality of web3 that is distinctive for transformation  -e.g. permisionlessness, way proposals put forward, open environment  - IS THIS A NEW LINE OF INQUIRY
	- Grid of 6/7 intentions and practices and you have them named and guiding questions and bullet points and aspects that web3 an enable and how it can constrain/contrast - light and shadow 
	- Can we narrow it down from 6/7 - 
	- what does web3 unlock - and combine with how might we learn from Indigenous communities/nature ecosystems  - giving people a lens for which they can then evaluate and whether it is transformative that are in web3 space and outside that are hallmarks
	- whose voices are being cultivated with care
	- Bring system transformation TO web3 communities <> USE web3 technologies to drive system transformation
	- Desired direction of our envisioned future has no link to web3 necessarily 
	- Basic question - what is role of web3 in being able to accelerate our pathway to that future - we have to be aware of downsides 

Next Steps:
-all reflect on where going next
-Steve W to write up a proposed idea of where we go next
-add edits and ideas to framework document
-SuperBenefit Weekly Meet Up - discussion about framework do
-web3 systems transformation weekly meet up - focus on where we go next

- Framework
	- Are all 7 pillars needed? Can we narrow down the criteria/bullet points under each one?
	- Can we summarise 
	- For example AIFS's immediate work may not be transformational (court refurbishments) but the way it is being done - the infrastructure - is what is potentially transformational - is equity and sovereignty 
- Instead of listing ‘Innovation’ as a Transformative Practice, perhaps we can reframe to explore how the DAO is dedicated to a practice of Internal Emergence. That is, rather than focus on exploring if their practices contribute to ‘external innovation;, how can we reframe to explore how a DAO is changing internally as a condition of being in a network or as a result of changing market conditions? How are DAOs being changed by what they are seeking to change? 
- There is also a way to measure this e.g. if a regulation has been passed, a DAO can track metrics of how they re changing in response to the regulation (whether it is pro- or contra- to the mentioned regulation)
- Discussed role of government - Canadian example that not exploring web3 because of political polarization related to crypto in particular and California [https://cointelegraph.com/news/california-dmv-to-digitize-car-title-management-system-via-tezos](https://cointelegraph.com/news/california-dmv-to-digitize-car-title-management-system-via-tezos)

- We are big fans of slowing down and spending time in the “space between”
- Commons Stack, Block Science, biomimicry, behavioural economics....
- Idea - Google Doc - to invite community to contribute. we could host a twitter space around it
	- building out what we've done so far, link to figjam
- Can we do more work to determine the characteristics that can lead to systems transformation...? And look critically and ask DAOs we are connected with - eg SB and AIFS - how they could increase their transformation potential (as per the 7 pillars)
- Wondering what research has already been done (in the ecosystem at large)…? 
	- Perhaps we share what we’re looking to dig into and see if anyone has worked on this… 
	- Also ask for recommendations re: systems transformation… see which orgs, DAOs ppl recommend and why…
- Maybe some tweets to introduce the work? Figjam is not always accessible to everyone
- NEXT STEPS:
	- Susie can take a look at this next week - map out possible Tweet threads. It helps that she hasn't been in the Figjam much, as she can advise re wayfinding 
	- Nate can work on a blog in a couple of weeks
	- Njoki will look at the Figjam. May need some cleaning up
	- Heenal think about how to create a space in Notion to showcase the systems transformation work
	- All give some thought to the framework and how it could be tweaked

	- Njoki will help to document the journey 

- govrn is all about tracking dao contributions 
- wonder is more like asana
- Twitter thread share by Susie [https://twitter.com/commonsstack/status/1582766523659169792?s=46&t=6Z9UBuI6nQlUqNLYU8T77w](https://twitter.com/commonsstack/status/1582766523659169792?s=46&t=6Z9UBuI6nQlUqNLYU8T77w) 
- maybe not all 7 pillars need to be there, or not in the same format? what could be refined? what could be removed?
- how to document this work and show how we have changed through the process of doing the work?


# Jan 17, 2023
- Attendees: @MBaldwin @Nate @heenal @susie kavanagh, 
- Recap:
	- Last week's meeting was a co-working space, researching different DAOs
	- Results shared in [Figjam Board](https://www.figma.com/file/uY3nFt3lRZC8q7XfVKG2Xi/System-Transformation-Project?node-id=0%3A1&t=RptL4EQhnYQODTb3-0) and in Discord
	- @njoki published [Mirror post](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/DIgEEhaM6zBK977YvHFXVVOnHkLB_4Qnw5-AOYG2M2s) relating to the project
	- We have pivoted from an initial goal of creating a library/repository into a focus on the intentions and practices of DAOs
	- What next?
		- More research?
		- Each of us could interview the DAO we are researching
		- We could do a blog post down the road
			- Report > Blog
			- could be a series of blogs
			- could be Twitter threads series "is it transformational?" 
		- Also could do podcasts down the road
		- Could apply for Gitcoin funding rounds in March/April?
		- We could use a mirror post and see if anyone would want to collect the post at x-amount to raise funds
		- Ask more questions directly to DAOs.... to "analyze what has enabled and constrained their systems transformation aspirations."
	- “A shift in mindset often comes with a shift in the lenses which we are using to make decisions.” ~ Susie Kavanaugh
		- With the idea that Susie has shared, we can generate a list of “characteristics” that lead to systems transformation

Krause House
- Krause House = "systems transformation by stealth"
- -sport is easily relatable, and decentralization can be disruptive to the underlying structures
- -sport growth and how media is decentralizing and how sport is configured and prioritize
- Michael is steward, investor and leading capital coordination
- -shifting from old broadcast model to network communities due to commercial shifts
- digital disruption is cutting across all ways sports operates - team management, athlete and talent development, media, esports/gaming/betting, new leagues, competitions and experiments and community engagement/investment
- patterns to take it to the scale with technoligies of decentralization
- why sport is useful from a transformation perspective 
- progressive ownership through participation - started with buying NBA team, what would be coolest thing to buy, league is not going to let anonymous people to buy a team, 3B dollars needed
- so need path to do it - so how to demonstrate fan participation/community engagement to improve the quality of engagement with fans/owners
- if going to take capital from community because will bring additional value proposition to the team
- how community can bring value, and soaking up more ownership
- end state - team is a cultural asset is not just a team or business/long term community based assets in a local jurisdiction, trust models 
- why not sit in a trust governed and owned by the community - can comply with regulations, league but that asset can be locked in perpetuity with the community within constructs of the league
- path where community based assets could be held by community driven vehicles
- other important dynamics - community leading to All In Sport in how to use primitives and parameters of web3 that advance community inclusion of sport - FIFA and use tooling of governnace/transparency that can be afforded by decentralized tech to improve integrity of those leagues, interesting unlock, use wedge of collective governance and take over 
- transparency and govenrance are ways to protect against these happening in league and important to league itself
- first move was to publish the NBA bylaws and how going to govern exiting owners
- Gitbook of explicit governance state (rathermercurial) that is what trying to do with KH, fans add new clauses , this is surface area 
- we are aligning with owners/leagues' existing needs & desires - better governance, decision-making, fan/community involvement - and we can sneak things in along the way...
- sport IS community - people coming together across boundaries to have fun and belong
- Analysis for Transformation (Steve)
	- systems of focus:  e.g.: cultural, governance, economic
	- changing relationship structures
		-     moving from passive to active engagement…from simply selling to fans to engagement
	- Operational structure change
		- new “production” structure for “doing something”
	- changed “ownership” stakeholders
	- a pathway to end goal
	- What’s the vision?
		- From … To
- 

some only want to buy NBA team so how do we recentre to embed the why, don't need to solve for it but just test it, meant to be how we lay out a perspective and invite others to see themselves within it 
how to demonstrate community engagement - chat, discord, membership NFTs, token gating, fan points is what come to mind - this brainstorm comes up in the community and fan engagement platform is in beta testing and how to engage fans

most human side of sport
where is transformational action - using 3 horizon approach, 12 folks with KH and outside for base layer and then opening it up
SB theory of change 
not stuck with asking for permission or a case for the system to transform, don't ask them to change but organize it 
transformative - something that is transformation can be around boundaries 
DAO's can do many things in parallel. the DAO isn't transforming a system, it's entering a system that's transforming and hosting and inviting innovative activity

## Agenda:
- Review Frameworks & Discuss Dimensions
- Discuss timelines for different Revolutions

-check in - some heaviness for team both work/family and how can this work together be a blanket that wraps around us in a meaningful way
-research - defintiion, how formal
-small amount of funding 5-10K for research could be a good demo moment
-reviewed [https://www.figma.com/file/uY3nFt3lRZC8q7XfVKG2Xi/System-Transformation-Project?node-id=114%3A15&t=yDQJoRBHuCfrCT2z-0](https://www.figma.com/file/uY3nFt3lRZC8q7XfVKG2Xi/System-Transformation-Project?node-id=114%3A15&t=yDQJoRBHuCfrCT2z-0) 
-Purpose 
- how do we capture the analysis and testing 
- iterative on purpose and expanded it and then narrowed, feels tangible and achievable and gives us those two major pieces of enabled and constraints and can help others to learn and take other path 
- we would come out with some findings with some guidance for those who want to create DAO/shift DAOs and capture DAOs that want to realize systems transformation
- are we all in for DAOs, could it be a protocol but most have DAO associated with it - landed on web3 initiatives - see V4
	- V4 - to build a repository of DAOs and other web3 projects that go beyond charity/philanthropy impact and align with agreed-upon definitions of “systems transformation”, and to analyze what has enabled and constrained their systems transformation aspirations.
- Frameworks - Steve walked the team through the frameworks
	- comment from Peter of how subjective this could be
	- Types of transformation resource shared [https://www.bouncebeyond.global/types-of-transformations](https://www.bouncebeyond.global/types-of-transformations) 
	- ![image.png](a0830e71-c375-4708-bcdc-c24c21d64633.png)
- we are looking at top left? for quantum leap as potential of web 3 to engage entire civilization and rapid/urgent need
- would it be interested to add SEEDS, crypto currency because of dramatic changes because the way originally designed was replicating the capitalist logics trying to get away from

Suggestion - for framework development, use Question format? 
- How did goals represent a transformation
- How is it organizing the work in comparison to traditional work organizing
- could use CCS/SuperBenefit/Krause House

Next Steps
-someone to fill out revolutions and workplan more fully
-next week would like to chat through Krause House DAO with questions to start to spark the framework development, Michelle to ask @Lewwwk if available

- Welcome & Check In
	- excited, jazzed, curious, learn more
	- DAOs perpetuating current system and DAOs focused on systems transformation
	- Some DAOs accelerating status quo not just perpetuating current system
	- Here to observe connections to DAO Primitive Research project
	- systems transformation to go beyond bandaid solutions, leverage points for complex systems to make them better
	- 
- DAO Cell Outline Discussion
	- See doc here: [https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/30f4e383-8a3c-4364-89e3-26682ca3051f](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/30f4e383-8a3c-4364-89e3-26682ca3051f) 
	- Team to add notes and update core team/contributor -
	- @ash has put together some questions related to DAO governance and systems transformation and next step will be to share with DAO Primitive Research team
	- Outline does not need to be perfect and is what currently thinking, emergent and needs the flexibility to evolve e.g. structure of contributors 
	- Cell nucleus helps reflect where at to take next step, and starts a conversation
	- @ash - Anarchy - without leaders, not without order - see governance as order/structure/process 
	- Good to do bigger thinking about what we want to do
	- For decision making - what is sovereignty for decision making for SB/cell 
		- cell may want to want to maximize autonomy
	- Discussion on what is multi-sig/who wants to be a signer - discussed core team
- Systems Transformation Framework & Principles - process & next steps
	- who wants to be part of coming up with what the principles are?
		- think of it like a circle: draft principles, test the principles against DAOs, revise the principles, repeat
		- we can use the CCS workshop/elective group to test and bounce ideas off
		- keep it simple, practical, core dimensions
		- core dimensions - how power is distributed 
			- power dimension
			- diversity dimension
		- seeing it as a series of questions/rubric - up 10 attributes and rubric?
		- 
- Check Out & Closing

Next Steps

	- [Indigenous Commons Launch Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gf14ez-9ESBkCU5U0T3ndeAkEu3ofBHRQ1KBBfBw42Y/edit)
	- Indigenous commons began during COVID and looking at what are assumptions and belief that inform the economic and political narrative of our time and how is value defined, not just about money, who defines the value and how value is created
	- proposes beginning is the ability of a strong "mother" and implicates itself into everything else, equity work is from compliance of governance and economic systems or constraints of fundamental power structures, how might create a mother of a culture free of these structures and the plurality of perspectives can cohere. Indigenous commons implies kinship. 
	- What might there be in web3 that could help us practice a more values-focussed economy
		- decentralized democratized technological that could be a channel or opportunity for an Indigenous, values, solidarity economy  
		- had funding for early research guided by Indigenous guardians, more participatory and practice guided research 
		- how to create a parallel system that is at individual, interpersonal and creation that is not linear
	- Money and value are not the same thing
		- How is value defined? 
		- Who defines it? 
		- How do people show up in discussions around value? 
		- How are the circumstances created for the greatest value to be embedded?
	- Compensate the first 13 Indigenous Guardians not based on money  
	- What does "indigenous" mean?
		- [Tyson Yunkaporta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCzlgBbv5OY) author of "Sand Talk"
		- First chapter addresses "what does indigenous mean?"
			- People who carry forward ancestral lineage of a people in relationship with a place and embodying place-based and nature-based practices
			- Centering identities is one of the biggest problems we face in achieving equity - we may be recreating patterns of domination, not patterns of liberation
	- What is being done in the near term?
		- found an interesting array of 13 guardians. collective developing the model
		- they have a plan for 6 month co-design period
		- together with a kinship philanthropy model at a distance from the guardians
	- where are the assumptions that are permeating the DAO landscape that we are not even aware of? what are the things that we are not conscious of that having a larger dataset would give us access to?
	- Indigenomics Institute and the book Indigenomics is also a good example [https://indigenomicsinstitute.com/](https://indigenomicsinstitute.com/) 
	- [https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374602529/inflamed](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374602529/inflamed) 
	- QUESTION: (_Steve) It’s rather…contradictory???…that you define indigenous in connection to physical/geo-space….and DAOs are virtual. _

		- This opens a conversation around what "indigenous" means, and if we are to define it the way that feels the most natural to do so
		- dissociation between the mind and the body in the west. very few of us are able to hold hands in co-liberation, unlearn rational ways of problem-solving
		- we are constellations
		- anonymity is problematic, because it's about becoming more intimate. understanding why people feel they need anonymity 
	- How do we relate to each other in a process of value creation?

- ## Introductions & Check-in: What makes you intrigued about this project?
	- Heenal - feels what SuperBenefit is building towards, why because thinking on a deep and fundamental level and paradigm shifts, what are real possibilities of web3 and technologies, next stage of human evolution and would like to seem rigour, examples and ask some hard questions, what is not systems transformation and be critical of it 
	- Steve - works with the core concept of how to develop transformation systems. web3 novice but sense their potency and interested in exploring how people are using it from a transformational perspective
	- Nate - led by social entrepreneurship into web3. involved with forefront and CCS and now exploring SuperBenefit
	- Ash - started career in economics and finance and moved into social entrepreneurship and moving more and more into systems change. not a techie
	- Peter - the more conversations I get in, the less I realise that I know. my passion is where is the link between the big theoretical stuff and the boots on the ground actions happening, where are the spaces for conversation. being willing to observe and then beginning to deconstruct the enmeshment they have with systems that they don't even realize they're part of. where are all the little pockets, the nuggets of conversation, ppl doing ting sin very unique ways. we can find these and make connections between them and this makes me very excited. where is the deep human connection that makes people passionate and creative?
	- Michelle - this project is now beyond a repository/library but "let's start with a framework". where are we seeing existing models, where are we seeing the possibility of deep systems transformation? thinking from a space of possibility but also "where are we getting stuck?"

	- ### Purpose
		- **DRAFT 1:** To build a repository of projects and DAOs that align with “systems transformation” and go beyond charity/philanthropy impact and include and demonstrate the interdependence and interplay of the following properties:

			- Equitable access to opportunity, support, services, and resources.
			- Regenerative and distributive economies.

			- Self-determination, rights, and sovereignty of identity.
			- Care and conservation of all life, ecosystems, knowledge, and cultures
		- **DRAFT 2**:  To develop a fuller picture of what is happening in the transformational space by building a repository of projects and DAOs that align with agreed-upon definitions of “systems transformation”, or "transformational potential and intent". Measurement and evaluation criteria for inclusion or exclusion will be developed transparently with influence from [Shaping Innovation Futures ](https://www.shapinginnovationfutures.co/)and other sources, with a second repository/list created for those that are determined not to be included. Criteria for inclusion in the repository may include projects that address:
			- Equitable access to opportunity, support, services, and resources.
			- Regenerative and distributive economies.
			- Self-determination, rights, and sovereignty of identity.
			- Care and conservation of all life, ecosystems, knowledge, and cultures
		- Steve - understanding the current reality and the potential of DAOs for transformational change. is the current use of DAOs transformative? Is there some potential not being realized? "Transformational potential and intent". Distinguish between incremental & transformational change. Get clear which system(s) we are talking about.
		- Nate - how would our project enable/encourage more experiments in systems transformations? important to think about the scope of the current project, too
		- Ash - [blind men and the elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant) - how can we learn more about the full picture of what is happening in the space by having visibility into how other experiments are working and how they perceive "systems transformation"
		- Peter - Possible alignment with research project at Cattail: What projects - ideally DAOs - are there that are indigenous-led from the ground up, that exist outside our current systems? What can we learn from these projects?
		- ## Project phases
			- 0) Define this project's "Cell Nucleus"
			- 1) Research & Develop a Systems Transformation & web3 framework
			- 2) Research projects and DAOs aligned with the systems transformation framework
			- 3) Development of systems transformation repository tool
			- 4) Synthesis and analysis of what has enabled and constrained the systems transformation projects and DAOs.
		- ✅ SUP-272 Think about tooling and create a Figjam board

# October 17, 2022
- **@Peter Gulka @heenal @Lewwwk @Ashraful.Impactrio @Rowan  @Nate @MBaldwin **
- Defining opportunities web3 potential for new capabilities to coordination that are closer to nature and to approaches we have imagined for
- How we clarify what this enables for transformative change and how to distinguish from incremental change
- How to think about group scale, atomic unit of one person
- Collaboration scale up to 1-10 people where can get genuine collaboration, deal with paradox, conflit and rich output of creativity
- Above 10 don’t have bandwidth for communication, coordination scale is 10-150 and constrain processes to things people can handle, if know who need to connect with and processes need to follow
- 150+ constituency/audience scale, broadcasting, constrain to vote and to be able to consume content 
- Different methodologies and complexity can make it challenging
- How make things possible at one scale and move it and coordinate
- How can pull up group intelligence
- Have cell primitive theory - and cell is in collaboration scale to start with nucleus with fundamental set of primitives of the cell model - purpose/design/ coordination protocols/treasury/core team/tooling
- Start with cell - 1-10 members and anyone look in from the outside and understand what trying to achieve 
- Proto-cell don’t want to arbitrarily force elements of primitive theory
- The core team is represented by the responsibility and by proposing and making decisions
- Group of people come together, shaping up together, tokens to fund some of this
- Start with convo that is vague and build more of the constraints of the cell 
- When would you form a cell or not to? - evolution of group in the proto-cell and have a convo about governance principles and how to reward, at some point form has to take function
- Some of this model came from governance writing and entity thinking, centralized old patterns, not as organizations but networks, atomic cells as high leverage opportunity, rather than network making decisions and influence, in principled way get to bottom up collective intelligence and 
- Examples 
- DAO Primitive Research project as its own cell - “creative cell” because not lots of governance layers
- Experiments in the process, so want to learn, extent to helpful want to keep testing the model in a safe to fail way
- The cell notion is the idea of building constraints as you shape into what you want, shearing complete, started as a library but as this had different phases (mini-revolutions), and DAO to DAO collaborations emerging - flexibility that this could 
- Team spins up as a cell and decided what kinds of decisions and what tooling can use
- If at Proto-Cell stage…
	- How do we want to take it forward
	- And what point want to empower team to put some shape
	- In absence of another option, not prescribing answers but giving questions for us to think about 
	- Curious to see over course of project, is anything missing in the DAO primitive cell -which decisions are blockers or pain points or if not any decisions is it the technical side
	- Too much structure too early can have to much governance too early and can be too arduous
	- Really understanding what is minimum viable project and sometimes too little governance
	- How can help DAO ecosystem out with governance system and DAO primitive cell
	- Growth for own sake can be malignant, cancer analogy, how can not risk destroying larger organism, every cell needs to import nutrition and export waste 
	- What does minimum viable mean for right now - aysync/who wants to step in/weekly meeting/
- ## Next Steps
	- Meeting Oct 24 at 7pm EST
		- Start to co-create the scoping of the project and how we will work together
		- Peter Gulka to share a bit more about the Indigenous Knowledge Bank
