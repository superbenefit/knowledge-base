Defining opportunities web3 potential for new capabilities to coordination that are closer to nature and to approaches we have imagined for
How we clarify what this enables for transformative change and how to distinguish from incremental change
How to think about group scale, atomic unit of one person
Collaboration scale up to 1-10 people where can get genuine collaboration, deal with paradox, conflit and rich output of creativity
Above 10 don’t have bandwidth for communication, coordination scale is 10-150 and constrain processes to things people can handle, if know who need to connect with and processes need to follow
150+ constituency/audience scale, broadcasting, constrain to vote and to be able to consume content 
Different methodologies and complexity can make it challenging
How make things possible at one scale and move it and coordinate
How can pull up group intelligence
Have cell primitive theory - and cell is in collaboration scale to start with nucleus with fundamental set of primitives of the cell model - purpose/design/ coordination protocols/treasury/core team/tooling
Start with cell - 1-10 members and anyone look in from the outside and understand what trying to achieve 
Proto-cell don’t want to arbitrarily force elements of primitive theory
The core team is represented by the responsibility and by proposing and making decisions
Group of people come together, shaping up together, tokens to fund some of this
Start with convo that is vague and build more of the constraints of the cell 
When would you form a cell or not to? - evolution of group in the proto-cell and have a convo about governance principles and how to reward, at some point form has to take function
Some of this model came from governance writing and entity thinking, centralized old patterns, not as organizations but networks, atomic cells as high leverage opportunity, rather than network making decisions and influence, in principled way get to bottom up collective intelligence and 
Examples 
DAO Primitive Research project as its own cell - “creative cell” because not lots of governance layers
Experiments in the process, so want to learn, extent to helpful want to keep testing the model in a safe to fail way
The cell notion is the idea of building constraints as you shape into what you want, shearing complete, started as a library but as this had different phases (mini-revolutions), and DAO to DAO collaborations emerging - flexibility that this could 
Team spins up as a cell and decided what kinds of decisions and what tooling can use
If at Proto-Cell stage…
- How do we want to take it forward
- And what point want to empower team to put some shape
- In absence of another option, not prescribing answers but giving questions for us to think about 
- Curious to see over course of project, is anything missing in the DAO primitive cell -which decisions are blockers or pain points or if not any decisions is it the technical side
- Too much structure too early can have to much governance too early and can be too arduous
- Really understanding what is minimum viable project and sometimes too little governance
- How can help DAO ecosystem out with governance system and DAO primitive cell
- Growth for own sake can be malignant, cancer analogy, how can not risk destroying larger organism, every cell needs to import nutrition and export waste 
- What does minimum viable mean for right now - aysync/who wants to step in/weekly meeting/

Next Steps
Meeting Oct 24 at 7pm EST
- Start to co-create the scoping of the project and how we will work together
- Peter Gulka to share a bit more about the Indigenous Knowledge Bank
