#[[264 Systems Transformation Project]] 
## Process Objectives
- Ensure contributors are able to surface their contributions
- Enable contributors to contribute to shaping the final allocation

## Process Flow
- Create a document to list the contributions of contributors (this doc)
- OPTIONAL:
	- Use [coordinape](http://coordinape.com) to allow contributors to collectively determine the allocation
		- Contributors should vote on how they perceive the value contributed to:
			- the work of the #[[P-264 Systems Transformation Project]] Cell
			- the support provided to you in your work
		- if we choose, the resulting allocation can help to determine the allocation of the remaining $SPRB that has been allocated to the Cell

## Process
1. All cell members are invited to complete a **contribution register** below ([see here for an example](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/work/SUP-151)) by April 24, 2023
2. All participating cell members share their wallet address with Heenal so that he can allocate $GIVE tokens
3. Coordinape round to allocate $GIVE tokens
