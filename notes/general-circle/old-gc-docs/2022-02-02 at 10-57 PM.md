# Launch Plan - unfiltered tactic list

**Develop a launch and communications plan for the hello-world crowd fund.**

## **Goals:**
- To build engagement and excitement about the launch of SuperBenefit and its theory of change
- To engage the existing web3 community into SB and their participation in the crowdfund
- To engage the existing SB community in crowdfund
- NFT collectors will also receive an allocation of $SPRB governance tokens, a fixed supply governance token, to enable on-chain governance, recognize contributions, and facilitate partnerships
- To promote and achieve our goal of ==20==ETH in the crowdfund for a shared treasury, government by the community, for the purposes of advancing our mission
- To increase our Discord membership to 500 for crowdfund launch and 5-10K after soul token

Strategy
## **Communications Tools**
- [ ] Hello World Mirror Post [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dJOLlbf-zUR6fcbktKjju32rqyI2RMVOxwQPpxS2-20/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dJOLlbf-zUR6fcbktKjju32rqyI2RMVOxwQPpxS2-20/edit) 
- [ ] SuperBenefit Discord [https://discord.gg/fCw74Y6r](https://discord.gg/fCw74Y6r) 
- [ ] SuperBenefit Website [https://www.superbenefit.org/](https://www.superbenefit.org/) 
- [ ] SuperBenefit Notion [https://www.notion.so/superbenefit/SuperBenefit-Community-7842086e42064061b7d48709c151c93c](https://www.notion.so/superbenefit/SuperBenefit-Community-7842086e42064061b7d48709c151c93c) 
- [ ] DAO Discords with alignment (see below)
- [ ] Shareable Content Guide similar to Pluriverse [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OpkoQeoudbqmWLoL5xvypp4N38dGvK2BWCcpqKPtmnk/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OpkoQeoudbqmWLoL5xvypp4N38dGvK2BWCcpqKPtmnk/edit) - Transformation Storytelling Fellow
- [ ] Teaser video - Transformation Storytelling Fellow

- [ ] Quotes from SB community about why participated in crowdfund/SB 
- [ ] What's Next Post Launch Blog
- [ ] 1-page version of Hello World post (TSF could write)
- [ ] Survey - see link at bottom of this doc for Reimagine survey responses. When we are talking to people about the campaign, ask them to fill out a short survey indicating their level of interest/commitment (key questions: how much will you contribute? how many people will you share this with?) This results in a database of people that we can follow up with once the campaign starts. This might feel a bit icky to do - so we can get people's emails instead when talking to them and then send out the survey en masse.
- [ ] For Discord members, we can ask them to complete the survey 5, even 10 times. This is not the time to worry about being too over-the-top in our communications. If people don't want to hear about the crowdfund campaign and they don't want to complete the survey, they shouldn't be part of our Discord, simple as that.
