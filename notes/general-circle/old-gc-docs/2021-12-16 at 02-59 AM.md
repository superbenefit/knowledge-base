**9. What is your community or project? ***
_Tell us a little bit about your community or project, including your mission and the number of members/subscribers/followers (whatever metric makes most sense). _
Society’s current institutions and infrastructures are incompatible with the changes required to address our existential risks of climate change and inequality. We have a hunch that web3 may offer the means to create a better future for all, for generations to come, and we're creating this space to explore that potential together. We believe that web3 hold the potential to reset (invert, flip and reimagine) those institutions and infrastructures. An equitable, sustainable, and abundant world is here for the making. If we choose it.
SuperBenefit has been assembling a diverse group of culture hackers, activists, movement builders and systems innovators from around the world and currently have 80+ early adopters who are co-creating the infrastructure to scale the movement. SuperBenefit is a community of passionate people who value a world that is open, caring, and abundant. We are here to catalyze the great inversion, as fast as humanly possible.
More than giving back or doing good, we are interested in opportunities to fundamentally reset how resources and authority flow through society, rewiring positive outcomes into the way things work. For us, success means flipping systems of scarcity into abundance, and breaking cycles of dependency into interdependence and self-determination. 

**10. How would you describe your call to adventure?  ***
This should describe where your project or community is going, what success looks like and why others should be excited to join.
- Our future. It's up to us. All of us. We're building a flywheel to accelerate the arrival of a better future. This begins with building a treasury and a community infrastructure. If we're looking for analogues from the old world, we can think of it like a new, inverted World Bank.
- Ultimate success looks like humanity living in a solarpunk future, a future where we've resolved the crises of climate and inequality and instead are aligned around systematically improving wellbeing, sustainability, and prosperity for all. What SuperBenefit looks like in that future is a treasury that is diversified across the web3 assets and infrastructures that have enabled that future, and that distributes funding to the proposals and DAO's that sense, explore and initiate the new models, infrastructure and culture that could become those foundations or that otherwise improve our collective capacity for making that future happen.
- There is no time left and no one coming to save us. There is however, a choice. Society is a product of what we choose and do, and web3 gives us a new opportunity to choose and create a very different future. We can't know what will get us there. But we can choose to be part of it. SuperBenefit exists to helps us figure it out together. SuperBenefit exists to accelerate the arrival of a better future.


~SuperBenefit is building an on-ramp into the new Web3 enabled societal infrastructure. ~
~We offer the opportunity for people to commit their attention and resources for an open, fair, caring, regenerative and abundant future, together.~
**11. Community Online Presence ***
Does the community or project already exist online?
Our placeholder is live at https://superbenefit.org with alpha site in process.
**13. What is your most active and frequently used social account?  ***
We are interested in seeing your communication (video, audio or writing) skills, so please share the best representation of those skills. It can be the same Twitter account linked above.
As a DAO we are not out there yet. Check our video submission for a hint though of what to expect. It's a quick sample started on a couple days ago. <link available tonight>
**14. Social Media Account / Handle ***
Please link to the account.

**15. How would you describe your Web 3 literacy and comfort level? ***
(e.g. novice, intermediate, expert, and share an example)
It feels super-wrong to say 'expert', but I'm literate and comfortable enough to know that we can't know what's next, and we're better off being good at probing, sensing, and responding. I've been fortunate to be early in Blitmaps, Loot, SharkDAO, Forefront, SOSC, CCS, and Krause House where i'm a backer (owner's box), steward, and lead on the investments team. (@Lewwwk)
**16. How would you describe the stage your project is in currently? * **

We have seeded our community with a deep bench of experience and expertise in social and societal transformation and community building. We are now transitioning into build mode to bootstrap the treasury and community infrastructure. This includes inviting our web3 networks and allies to join us in architecting and implementing the NFT contract, mint-site, and campaign, and the latest practice in community governance and operations.  
**18. Can you provide the name and contact info (email/twitter dm/discord all work) of a community member?  **
This should be someone active in your community, but not within the leadership team, who can give a member's perspective on the community. Please make sure you've confirmed that they are ok with being contacted by us!

**19. What is one goal for your project that you would like to work toward in the Accelerator? ***
In 1-2 sentences, share your goal.
Our goal for participating in the accelerator is to bootstrap a treasury and governance token through an uncapped NFT drop that reaches more that 10,000 people, converts 10% of those into discord members, and 10% of those into active contributors working on community infrastructure and treasury building and deployment. In other words, our goal is to kickstart a flywheel for a new, inverted world bank that contributes to the foundational infrastructures of our collective future.
**20. Share a time when you managed and executed on a project from start to successful finish. ***
What was the project and how did you work to ensure project completion and success? This does not need to be part of your current community's work.
I've founded and exited two companies, failed at other times, and initiated and supported several initiatives that have grown communities and nudged systems. Conventional founder-led leadership is not what I think will make this successful. I've done that and found it often brutal and suboptimal, closing off potential, pathways, and scope. It's demanded tight strategy with clear directives. It works, if you want to build something . There is a different way, and that is what we are doing here.
So, no, I didn't literally answer this question, but hope that I'm sharing something more important about what we're trying to get right, from the beginning.... gathering a high-performing community of allies... and building them an infrastructure to build this new, inverted world bank in parallel, with everyone, together.

**21. What experience do you have leading a community? What experience do you have contributing to a community? ***
Share details from these two experiences.

More details on two projects:
Participatory Canada - successful prototyping with hundreds of residents in 3 cities during the pandemic (2020-2021), which has led to the first of its kind large-scale, Indigenous-led, deep demonstration learning campus. The prototyping was a chance to test local responses to strengthened participation culture and assess emerging opportunities for building participatory social infrastructure in these communities for the long-term. .[https://www.participatorycanada.ca/](https://www.participatorycanada.ca/)

**22. Have you connected or met with anyone from the Seed Club team?  **
If yes, please let us know who you connected with and where/how (e.g. Twitter Space, Info Session, 1:1 Meeting, etc.).
Michael (Lewwwk) DM'd with Jess (ThatTallGuy). Lewwwk has been a long-time SC lurker and checked in with commodore and flex on their accelerator experience (obvs, great). 
**23. Video ***
Link to an uploaded video of NO MORE THAN 3 MINUTES that clearly responds to the following questions:
- Who you are;
- What your community or project is, including the call to adventure; 
- Your experience leading and contributing to communities in the past; and 
- What you hope to gain and have to offer by participating in SC04. 

Videos do not need to have high production quality - we are looking for clarity of ideas and communication.

## Old/Removed Content
**_ML version_**
- In 1944, nation-states came together to rebuild infrastructure for a better, post-war future. They called it the world bank. As we face the crises of climate and inequality and the failure of our institutions and nation-states to address them, we stand in a moment to come together again. This time though, it's not about nation-states, it's about all of us.
- We're building a new, inverted world bank on the foundations of web3, by and for everyone, for generations to come.
- We started by [onboarding](http://twitter.com/superbenefitdao) people that have dedicated their lives to understanding and accelerating systemic, societal transformation, into the world and opportunity of web3. We've grown into an active discord community with 80+ members actively working on bootstrapping a treasury and governance infrastructure through a composable nft, social token for distributing governance based on participation, and an ohm fork to scale the treasury after the nft drop.
- We've intentionally been quiet, focused on building the foundations for the community, and want to join seedclub to be thoughtful on how we invite and support those who join the mission as we roll out the nft, token, and treasury.
