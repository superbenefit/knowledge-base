# Web3 Adventure Tour - Discussion notes

Goal: a primer to web3, to help you feel more comfortable in the space, get stated with web3, and answer any questions you might have

Start with any questions you have or any areas that you would like to explore
- Curious about metaverse
- It's so different to our existing cultures. Trying to make up my mind whether it's substance

Sharing information -> co-creating information -> co-owning information
web2: increased backlash
- advertising everywhere
- manipulation of elections
- we (the users) are in fact the product

web3: what if we all were the owners of these platforms?
bitcoin: independence -> ethereum: interdependence. "now we are free, what if we could enable an infinite number of coins to exist (and code to run) on this shared database?"
NFTs -> an introduction of culture that made this all more accessible. moving out of this weird world of finance and trading and speculation into this world of art and culture. because behind the defi and NFTs was COMMUNITY.
As soon as authority and power start to concentrate, the community starts to leave (or may even fork). We are seeing this time and time again in how these things are iterating.
Q: Isn't this the same promise that we were given with web1 and open source software?
A: OSS can't survive and thrive without funding. This, web3, integrates financing - and the software is still open source! If people don't like it, they will fork it and go in a different direction.
## web3 examples
### nouns
Building off the idea of Cryptopunks
1 auctioned per day
141 days now. Treasury = 14,550 ETH
Why are these things valuable in the first place? Because this is what people are prepared to pay for them... No need to get into the subjectivity
DAO + governance proposals all available transparently through their website, with discussion on Discord
Q: Is this just another device for speculation?
A: There is a real treasury behind it. Having some stake in governance of that treasury has value. Like owning a share in a big company
- The "company" isn't producing value? It is figuring out the direction it will take. And the Treasury contains yield-generating assets.
- This couldn't happen without web3, without the underlying trust mechanism. You wouldn't trust if the funds were in someone's bank account.

## Loot
Just a text file containing a list of 8 items
"Gold" was created, and then more loot + synthetic loot - how to get loot to more people, not just the initial 8,000
And then people asked "where did these items actually come from?" and then the lore (story) formed through community co-creation. And then realms project, ways to unbundle your bag, representations of bags, characters, and now quests. Potentially to come are movies and more.
Flipping game design. What are the primitives of this game and how can we turn this over to the community to co-create? because it will be more magical if we all create it together.
transaction fees. more cross-chain interoperability solutions. eg opensea now lets you mint NFTs on Polygon
Polygon, Solana etc have much lower fees and much lower energy consumption 
SB is not on any chain yet and has not made a decision
## Q&A
Q: Is crypto all a bubble, won't the government shut it down?
A: The system is very resilient and isn't going away. It can repel actions from individual actors, regulators, government actors - eg China every 6 months says that it's going to ban crypto. You can't put it a box - it's too late! The question becomes 
Q: Is crypto a haven for money-laundering and tax evasion?
A: Actually the opposite - every transaction is on-chain and can be traced, so it's hard to hide! At least until more privacy solutions arrive. Tax authorities are sleeping at the wheel but they will catch up. Projects are increasingly trying to do things in a regulatory compliant way (eg reserving and paying taxes)
Q: Isn't everyone trying to make a quick buck? How do you account for the short-termism of governance tokenholders wanting to pump the token price?
A: OHM designed mechanisms to incentivize holding and staking
Q: How does what SB is doing fit into this picture?
A: We are raising funds now to co-create and fund the societal infrastructure of the future. we can use the treasury to support infrastructure investments. Which will create more revenue (and impact) in turn.
Q: How does SB have the team it takes to carry out this project?
A: There is no formal structure. everyone who joins Discord jumps in about becomes part of the team. One of the things we are learning: what are the key things needed for this kind of thing to grow? It's not about individual leadership but about the underlying structure, governance, culture & community. We have those skills!!
Q: example of impact with web3 project if one exists?
A: check out klimadao.finance - sequestered much carbon in only 2 months, already increased price of carbon credits by 63%. There are chances to intervene in our existing systems and also chances to design whole new systems and ways of going things

## Ideas for future tours
- Different types of tokens
- What is a DAO?
- What is DeFi and how does it work? Show an example
- How does Klima work? (seems a closer example to SB than nouns or loot)
