#[superbenefit governance](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/superbenefit%20governance.md) 
June 20, 2022
This is a draft for discussion by General Circle, based on:
- [Current governance doc](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/pages/435b35d2-7737-4223-9d8e-6401af42283d)[](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/1cffef2d-a3a1-499c-9799-c21f2afb6358)
- [Governance musings](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/1cffef2d-a3a1-499c-9799-c21f2afb6358)


## Design Principles
- Minimum viable governance, only as much as we need
- Attracts energy, skills and contributions
- Creates clarity of action and forward momentum
- Rewards Contributors for their efforts
- Respects the autonomy of Contributors working to advance SuperBenefit's Purpose
- Key decisions and actions are documented and transparent to all

## Governance Structure 
- [$sprb](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/$sprb.md)
	- SuperBenefit rewards the work of Contributors with tokens, including the $SPRB token which is used in the DAO's governance.
	- Contributors use $SPRB to vote on major strategic decisions of SuperBenefit DAO.
- Proposals
	- Proposals are the primary means by which decisions are made which affect SuperBenefit's #[ethos](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/ethos.md) or the deployment of SuperBenefit's #[treasury](/tags/treasury.md).
	- Any $SPRB holder may make a Proposal by following this process:
		- Share a draft of the Proposal in the #proposal-ideas or #proposal-development channels in Discord. The preference is to reach a fist-to-five soft consensus, so that any major revisions can happen in conversation before the Proposal goes to Snapshot.
		- Once a proposal is developed, it is turned into a task in Clarity and the General Circle facilitates a voting process via Snapshot for a duration of no less than 48 hours
		- Following the voting period, the results of the Proposal will be recorded, publicized and executed promptly
	- Individual Circles (including the General Circle) may determine their own processes for making, voting on, recording and executing Proposals pertaining to that Circle's Purpose and Accountabilities
- [general circle](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/general%20circle.md) 
	- The General Circle is the originator of the core Circles of SuperBenefit and is accountable for setting and resourcing strategic direction
	- The members of the General Circle are the General Circle Lead and all Circle Leads.
	- Any $SPRB holder may propose changes to the Purpose and Accountabilities of the General Circle by making a Proposal. Such a Proposal requires a super-majority (66.67%) to pass.
- General Circle Lead
	- The General Circle Lead sets strategy and priorities, and together with other members of the General Circle, steers SuperBenefit towards its Purpose (see #[ethos](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/ethos.md)).
	- The General Circle Lead is accountable to holders of $SPRB, who have the authority to change who fills the General Circle Lead role through the Proposal process.
-  Circles (or Cells)
	- SuperBenefit's work is organized into Circles, which may be created by the passing of a Proposal outlining the proposed Circle's Purpose and Accountabilities. The Purpose may include overseeing a domain or pursuing a specific objective.
	- A Circle may be permanent or temporary. The Circle from which it emerged may remove a Circle when it is no longer needed.
	- Each Circle has a Lead, who is invited into the role by the Circle it is accountable to
- Circle Lead
	- The Circle Lead helps the Circle move forward by setting priorities, creating roles, and inviting Contributors into work. 
	- Membership of the Circle is determined by the Circle Lead. Circle Leads have the ability to remove individual Members from that Circle if they are keeping it from moving forward.
	- Any $SPRB holder may make a Proposal to remove a Circle Lead from their role.



## Notes and old material
The General Circle can decide to bring important strategic decisions to $SPRB  for a vote.
- ***HOW DOES OUR CULTURE, VALUES GET REPRESENTED IN OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE 

Holders of $SPRB have the authority to change the Purpose of the General Circle through a proposal, reaction, discussion and integration process.
- the purpose and accountabilities of the general circle are ratified by vote. changes can be proposed for vote by any holder (what the process is for proposal to get up to snapshot then is the other key piece that needs definition) 

Leads can invite other Squad or Circle members into the roles of **Facilitator** (convening and facilitating group process) and/or **Secretary** (documenting key decisions and outcomes) as needed
- NOT SURE IF THIS IS NEEDED. IT'S UP TO EACH DAO CELL TO 
	- agree - it's redundant. could be suggested as a best prractice thhough as a circle grows. ** **
- HOW WILL COMMS AND COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE FUNCTION - AS A DAO CELL WITH OUTCOMES BY REVOLUTIONS
	- these patterns could be collected by watching how different circles perform (not even as best practices, but patterns that proved effective in certain contexts/situations) 

The General Circle is responsible for overall structure: it creates Squads and sets their Purpose, and can remove Squads when they are no longer needed 
- perhaps just the first layer? probably better if the gc can reach down two levels to change something.  

reading below i think we can leave Roles out. We can suggest that best practice is to establish roles (having a purpose and accountability) prior to a person being able to take on formal responsbility. E.g. before a new circle is formed... a role with purpose and accountabilities is likely the first step. As the responsibilities grow and it needs more resources (participants), it can become a circle with a lead role in it. This keeps authority flowing outward and accountabilities flowing up. this doesn't mean it has to end up many layers deep, just that it has to flow up to a single point of accountability. 




IT IS PROBABLY A GOOD TIME TO RETHINK SQUADS. LIKELY ALL TEAMS IN SB START AS DAO-CELLS AND THEN FORM INTO MORE STRUCTURED MORE PERMANENT CELLS TO DO CORE OPERATIONS AND OTHERS ARE MORE AUTONOMOUS AND LESS STRUCTURED TO EXPERIMENT. 
- i think going back to the idea that circles are just purposes wiith accountabilities that have more than one person fulfilling them. e.g. a role is a specified purpose and accountability to be filled by one person. this is super simple, minimal, and flexible.
