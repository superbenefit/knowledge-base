The following was passed through #[55 Proposal 0- v1 SuperBenefit DAO Governance Model](55%20Proposal%200-%20v1%20SuperBenefit%20DAO%20Governance%20Model) 




## Design Principles
- Minimum viable governance, only as much as we need
- Attracts energy, skills and contributions
- Creates clarity of action and forward momentum
- Rewards Contributors for their efforts
- Respects the autonomy of Contributors working to advance SuperBenefit's Purpose
- Key decisions and actions are documented and transparent to all

## Governance Structure 
- [$sprb](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/$sprb.md)
	- We will reward work of Contributors with tokens (based on a formula TBD), which will include a token to be used in DAO governance. - TO DO - WORK THROUGH THE DIFFERENT TOKEN ALLOCATION METHODS... BOUNTIES, PROJECTS, DIRECTION ALLOCATION ETC TO EXPLAIN HOW EACH WORKS 
	- Contributors use their governance tokens in voting on major strategic decisions of SuperBenefit DAO.
	- Holders of the governance tokens have the authority to change the Purpose of the General Circle through a proposal, reaction, discussion and integration process.
	- Holders of the governance tokens have the authority to elect/appoint the General Circle Lead.
- [general circle](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/general%20circle.md) 
	- The primary decision making body, connecting and integrating the work of all Squads
	- The General Circle members include the General Circle Lead, the Leads of Squads plus any additional Roles that the Circle may create to further its work.
	- The General Circle Lead sets strategy and priorities, and together with other members of the Circle, steers the initiative towards its Purpose (see #[ethos](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/ethos.md)). Currently, this role is played by @Lewwwk.
	- The General Circle Lead is accountable to the holders of governance tokens, who have the authority to change who fills the General Circle Lead role.
	- The General Circle can decide to bring important strategic decisions to the Contributors for a vote.
	- The General Circle is responsible for overall structure: it creates Squads and sets their Purpose, and can remove Squads when they are no longer needed 
- [squads](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/squads.md) (or sub-circles)
	- IT IS PROBABLY A GOOD TIME TO RETHINK SQUADS. LIKELY ALL TEAMS IN SB START AS DAO-CELLS AND THEN FORM INTO MORE STRUCTURED MORE PERMANENT CELLS TO DO CORE OPERATIONS AND OTHERS ARE MORE AUTONOMOUS AND LESS STRUCTURED TO EXPERIMENT. 
	- GENERAL CIRCLE SHOULD INCLUDE PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE DIFFERENT LAYERS (OF SCALE) OF ENGAGEMENT SO WE DON'T END UP WITH A DOMINATOR HIERARCHY. 
	- We will organize work into Squads (referred to as sub-circles in Holacracy), which are created by the General Circle.
	- Each Squad has a Purpose it is pursuing and/or a domain that it controls. All Contributors actively contributing to the Circle's Purpose are members of the Squad.
	- Each Squad has a Lead, who is invited into the role by the General Circle Lead
- [squad lead](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/squad%20lead.md)
	- Leads help a Squad or Circle move forward by setting priorities, and inviting Contributors into work. They also have the ability to remove individual Contributors from that Squad or Circle if they are keeping it from moving forward.
	- Leads can invite other Squad or Circle members into the roles of **Facilitator** (convening and facilitating group process) and/or **Secretary** (documenting key decisions and outcomes) as needed
		- NOT SURE IF THIS IS NEEDED. IT'S UP TO EACH DAO CELL TO 
		- HOW WILL COMMS AND COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE FUNCTION - AS A DAO CELL WITH OUTCOMES BY REVOLUTIONS
- ***HOW DOES OUR CULTURE, VALUES GET REPRESENTED IN OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE
