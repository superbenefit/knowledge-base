## Triage Items
### Follow up items from last week
- Flashlight - need help recruiting graphic designers and writers.
	- **ACTION:** Request @flashlight to provide an outline of what he's looking for, something that can be shared; What can we offer people? How much time? Post to Guilds?
- Guilds are guilds. It's all about skillsets.
	- **ACTION:** If there's a skillset your squad needs, ensure it's captured in the roles/guilds here: #[47 Refactor Guilds](47%20Refactor%20Guilds) 
- How do people become a contributor? Bounties are a great way of trying someone out!
	- **ACTION:** Leads to create bounties, post to guilds to invite people in
- Transparency of meetings & chats - @heenal 
	- **ACTION:** Leads to share project updates and documents in the appropriate Discord project channel. A minimum of a weekly update.
- I'm not clear on governance for treasury decisions @Rowan  
	- This process can be discussed later. At this stage we won't have a large treasury.
	- "You can't screw yourself by delaying your token drop"
- Capturing final feedback on ToC
	- **ACTION:** direct feedback to @AlexH by 12/02/22
- Timeline for crowdfund launch - @heenal 
	- Is 22 Feb set in stone? How can we best work together on everything that needs to get done?
		- We'll never be 100% ready
		- Are we ready to honour the invitations?
			- Map-making & resource flow work needs some more thought
		- Let's start to things about what the next goals and projects are
- Remove the Guild blocker - @remarkk 
	- There is nothing in my mini-review findings that relates to Guild structure. The Guilds are not a formal part of our Governance structure. However, we need to clarify who is responsible for engaging Guild members.
- Squad Contributor Roles - @remarkk 
	- We have one formal Squad-specific role (Reflection Practice Coordinator, part of Community Experience).
	- **Preliminary Recommendation:** In our v0 governance setup, Squads have a Lead and a Member role, who work together on projects that are prioritized by the General Circle within our Roadmap. As they grow they may need more defined roles, but at this point in time we have <10 Contributors overall, so simplicity is optimal. Squads may also choose to fill a formal Facilitator or Secretary role to support their work as needed. I propose that we remove any other Squad level roles and not add roles until necessary to support prioritized work.
		- Once we have $SPRB, each Squad Lead would get a budget that they could use for bounties, and could also submit proposals for more funds
- For Transformation Storytelling Fellow given it is like an internship not a staff role at CFC but can be dedicated as a little or as much a needed at SB, does a proposal need to come to GC or bounty? How will this work with $SPRB tokens? Need direction on approach @MBaldwin 
	- ✅ SUP-174 Follow up with Peter to make an introduction to Ayusha 
- Major Decisions for Launch - @remarkk 
	- What pieces in development need a formal approval/consent decision through documented and transparent Proposals?
		- ToC is going to a proposal
		- $SPRB design is going to proposal
- Squad role specs incomplete or need for clarification - @remarkk 
	- [#[operations squad](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/operations%20squad.md)](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/pages/4adc5a52-2d1e-45fd-918d-ada1ce7fd3c0) - @Ryan  @Lewwwk 
	- #[product development squad](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/product%20development%20squad.md) - @Ryan  @Lewwwk 
	- #[treasury squad](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/treasury%20squad.md) and #[resource flow squad](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/resource%20flow%20squad.md) - overlap? - @Lewwwk @Rowan  
	- #[community experience squad](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/community%20experience%20squad.md) and Culture and Communications Squad - overlap? - @MBaldwin @flashlight 
- Bounty Governance - @remarkk 
	- We have one active bounty. How was it created and funded? Who decides?
	- **ACTION:** @Lewwwk and @remarkk to work on a solution for this.
		- ⬜️ SUP-173 Governance & Treasury get together to figure out a process for bounties and budget allocation
