## Discussion Topics

- Yield Fund - 

### Triage

	

  - good place to start - what would folks find interesting and resonating -  Filsan - Impact not being dictated by investors, DAO would guide the impact, traditional structures can restrict who is guiding impact

  - Michael - open exploration to date, what is clarifying for Yield Fund as conceived using DeFi enhanced yield compared to endowment capital allocation strategy of larger amounts of treasury - something to be extreme low risk and create premium and taps much larger specific amounts of capital, investment capital, which would allow to get to scale, getting them to this is an acceptable strategy and very specific and to be successful would need interest in making that pitch

  - Heenal - when having convo with endowments and funds, this is on their investment side not impact side, bonus impact on top of the investment side

  - impact pitch, won't be easy because conventional investment committees and boards but it has potential to scale

## üîç **Overview of the Yield Fund Discussion**

The group explored whether and how to move forward with a **Yield Fund model**‚Äîa mechanism for generating impact by capturing a portion of DeFi yield generated on low-risk capital (e.g. from endowments or philanthropic treasuries) and directing it toward social impact.

---

## üß≠ **Current Status and Context**

- **Initial model**: A structure exists on Figma showing how a portion of DeFi-generated yield would fund an "impact treasury."

- **Inspiration**: Breadchain and other community funding models were explored as alternatives or enhancements.

- **Key question**: Is this structure compelling enough for investors or partners, or would they find better yield-generation options elsewhere?

---

## üí° **Key Insights from the Discussion**

### 1. **Value Proposition Uncertainty**

- There's concern that **investors (esp. institutional ones like endowments)** could bypass this model and invest directly in DeFi for higher yield, **weakening the case** for routing through this fund.

- However, several felt this concern may be **overestimated**, as many institutional investors are **still risk-averse** and unfamiliar with DeFi.

### 2. **Differentiation and Purpose**

- Participants agreed the fund shouldn't be built just for a single potential investor (e.g. Boann).

- The fund must serve a **broader purpose**, ideally **something the group is collectively excited about** and **aligned with its values**.

### 3. **Benefits of the Model**

- Heenal emphasized the appeal of generating **"free" impact** via yield without touching principal‚Äîa conservative, yet potentially scalable approach.

- It also presents an opportunity to **fund operational costs** for SuperBenefit or local partners‚Äîsomething not covered elsewhere.

### 4. **Risk and Effort vs Reward**

- Michael noted that although the **capital pools** involved are large, getting investment-side decision-makers (risk-averse, unfamiliar with web3) on board is a **significant lift**.

- Michelle added that there's **no guarantee** this model will land well with funders‚Äîeven if the numbers work‚Äîbecause they often struggle with the **narrative shift** and **risk optics**.

---

## ‚ùì **Unresolved Questions**

- **Is the yield fund model truly compelling or innovative enough to attract funders?**

- **What is the specific impact the fund will support, and how will it be measured and communicated?**

- **Should the fund be geographically focused (e.g. London, Ontario), thematically focused (e.g. environmental outcomes), or both?**

- **How is this different from what existing local funders (like Verge) already offer?**

- **What mechanisms or storytelling will make the impact credible and distinctive?**

---

## üß† **Meta-Level Reflections**

- Rather raised a critical concern: the group is spending a lot of time discussing **mechanisms** (DeFi yield, structure), without first aligning on the **impact problem** being solved.

- He urged a first-principles approach: **What impact? For whom? Why this model?**

- This was echoed by others who felt the current process risked being too abstract or funder-driven, rather than mission- or community-driven.

---

## ‚úÖ **Next Steps Proposed**

1. **Create a dedicated "cell"** for those with energy to keep working on the yield fund model.

2. **Clarify differentiation** from other local initiatives (like Verge) to ensure uniqueness.

3. **Explore community-owned models** (e.g. commitment pools) as an alternative or complement to institution-driven models.

4. **Await Rowan's input** before re-approaching Boann or other institutional funders.

---

## üß± **Structure Options on the Table**

- **Current Figma model**: Philanthropic capital earns DeFi yield; yield goes to an impact treasury governed by DAO/community.

- **Breadchain-style model**: More community-native, peer-to-peer funding model.

- **Commitment pools**: As proposed by Rather, enabling community-owned financial resilience.

- **Local community fund**: Proposed by Heenal as a London- or SW Ontario-focused fund using Web3 primitives to support grassroots regenerative initiatives.

## üìå Summary

The group is grappling with alignment on structure, purpose, and audience for the yield fund concept. While there's shared excitement about the potential of web3 tools to unlock capital and power for impact, there's also a clear need to pause on mechanism-first thinking, get clarity on what impact they want to create, and who the model is truly for.

The momentum is moving toward small-scale prototyping, clear narrative development, and testing viability with funders‚Äîonce internal clarity and alignment are reached.
