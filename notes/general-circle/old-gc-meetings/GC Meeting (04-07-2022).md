	- Message
		- @list_of_handles Thank you for being part of our Discord community and supporting SuperBenefit in its early days. The General Circle has passed a Proposal to distribute 10,000 $SPRB (SuperBenefit's governance token) to our early supporters. This will allow you to vote on Proposals and be a part of SuperBenefit's growth and development :) Simply DM @my_handle with your ETH wallet address and we will send you some $SPRB on the Polygon chain. (Not sure how to find your wallet address or need help setting one up? DM @michelle or @heenal from the Community Experience team)
