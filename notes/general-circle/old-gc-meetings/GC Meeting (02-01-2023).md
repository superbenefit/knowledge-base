Rough Notes:

-network effect and innovation-don't get into defining the org model or defining a DAO - rather than a type of org - rather the coordinating primitive and tools used in DAOs applied in a network to a systems change - not DAO as an entity - what is the unique leverage so not creating a nonprofit model
-testing - intention and practice-deep into impact - and you can understand it in that way - it is combo - are there primitives we can compose together for a leveraged effect - we are looking to discover a new dynamic - even looking at small things not just scale - what is primitive unlock? - resources, money, focus
-which primitives are giving it more transformative/systemic advantage - specific feature of applications - 
-more democratic and centralized was focus for DAOs and this past year but what makes it more powerful
predictions for 2023 - focus on governance and retroactive public goods
what is this for - systems transformation/transformation mapping is the purpose within the cell model and then compose governance systems around it
-unlocking the capacity of a network, cannot rely on someone else to do it (consultants) or solve it, the network or system has to solve it
-for SuperBenefit web3 collaborators are audience now - not those in web3  - this is a swing and a shift back to those outside of the space and see the opportunity for the space for systemic shift - who does SB find interesting to work with and where is the potential 
-real money flowing in from the real world to web 3 and the entire economy will end up on chain-it is of the moment as people are slowly seeing how to effect the system is to be in the system 
-ready for some writing as we go into 2023 - Rowan will reflect on a new post to capture the iteration and learning 
-2022 year in review from Heenal will be great for us all to contribute to and decide what should come from it based on content
