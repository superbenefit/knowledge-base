## Triage Items
- What tensions do you have that need resolution to move forward in your work?
	- Onboarding & Townhall
		- Bridging old and new innovation - crossing the chasm, lifecycle of innovation - early and late majority tools and have to bring a beginner mind, what is to learn here, 
		- could do a lunchtime coffee chat, rather than a formal townhall or onboarding call
	- Engagement with NFT tokens - anything we want to do to mention that in onboarding
	- Feedback from first Twitter space - anything we can do differently next time? (Heenal)
		- more people to stage - tolerance of out there comments come in that "off topic"
		- don't need to end exactly at the hour
		- check out Twitter threads of speakers and reference - @Lewwwk to check before 
		- DAO 2 DAO - values aligned speakers, put a few provocative questions into this space
		- what does it mean to be proactive in our values and the principles of what we are building and what they represent
		- Follow up synthesis articles really valuable
