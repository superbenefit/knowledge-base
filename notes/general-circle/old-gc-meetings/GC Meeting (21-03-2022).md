# Week of March 21, 2022
`Lewwwk: Suggest we do NOT do metrics check-ins for the next couple weeks until we build some momentum and can slowly add things that truly matter to our progress. Also request that we keep the updates to what's relevant to coordinating our activities and progress, not laundry list of all activity. Lean and minmimal is important to give space for us to focus on the most important things.`
- Focus energy outwards not inwards. We created good foundations; now focus on activity and how our processes and structures can support that. Activity creates energy.

## Attendees
- @Lewwwk @MBaldwin @Rowan  @heenal 

## Checkin
How are you arriving?
## Projects
- #[Intervention 1- Mapping pathways to the future](Intervention%201-%20Mapping%20pathways%20to%20the%20future) 
`This will require some extra time to catch folks up, and is the foundation for getting Rev 1 started.`
	- Last week: 
	- notes from yesterday's session [https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/8b283112-a094-41e3-9e83-64b0ae766e41](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/8b283112-a094-41e3-9e83-64b0ae766e41)  (@Rowan  )
	- Directions
		1. Public conversations on governance (beyond web3)
		2. Research project on current innovations in governance emerging in web3 (perhaps this lives in invitation #2)
		3. Michael's ongoing conversations exploring specific problems showing up in web3 (+ opportunities for meta-currency + soul token as solutions) 
	- This week:
- #[[Intervention 4- A Metacurrency for Metagovernance, Values and Acceleration
]]
	- Last week:
		- Had a second session with Gabagool (Information Token). 
			- Conversation
				- Explored metacurrency (e.g  $SUPERB) concept that would have bonding of existing assets (eg ENS) in exchange for discounted metacurrency, as well as staking of metacurrency for governance token (e.g. $gSUPERB). 
				- Metacurrency represents basket of future-positive infrastructure assets and would be an attractive first asset for next wave of crypto newcomers.
				- Governance token enables direct participation and would be useful in vote action
				- Would also require human engagement mechanism -> #[Intervention 3- Creating a Soul-Bound Portal to a Better Future](Intervention%203-%20Creating%20a%20Soul-Bound%20Portal%20to%20a%20Better%20Future) 
				- Also discussed:
					- Need for supporting informed governance and voting on proposal (would be key function of the protocol team)
					- Extending into real-world (government) policy and voter engagement
			- Outcome: he's writing up a blog post to see who responds to it
	- This week:
		- Additional selective outreach and conversations as they happen.
- #[46 Contribution recognition and rewards event](46%20Contribution%20recognition%20and%20rewards%20event) 
	- To ensure we capture and remember the contributions each made through rev0, please do fill out the #[151 Pre-launch contribution register](151%20Pre-launch%20contribution%20register).
	- Lewwwk recommend we hold onto the remaining 800k allocation as a founding contributor's reserve, for us to choose how to allocate once we gain some more momentum and see how this is taking shape. While we will want to recognize unique contributions among the team, we may also collectively find greater value in using some of that allocation to incentivize new contributors and partners that might play a critical role in getting Rev 1 spinning. There is no action required to proceed with this recommendation. If someone feels strongly that the allocation event should happen now, they can make a proposal to that effect.
- #[Information Squad- Revolution 1](Information%20Squad-%20Revolution%201) - @heenal
