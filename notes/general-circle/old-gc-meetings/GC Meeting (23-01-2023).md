	- Annual Review - not sure what to do since neither Njoki, Michelle nor I have time to write it up properly. Maybe it's ok to just leave it as a Google Doc for internal use only.
- AIFS Update
- Equality Fund


## Triage Items
_What tensions do you have that need resolution to move forward in your work?_
- Not sure where to put AIFS related stuff as most updates are in the DAO primitive but the community experience/fundraising is also a place we are supporting. - open to moving it around
- Noted that we haven't been allocating $SPRB for all the work that's been going on lately. It would be great if someone could take that on, go and have conversations with all the cells and contributors... Even some of our past projects didn't allocate all their $SPRB. Maybe we do a big retrospective after the AIFS launch, when we're ready to move onto SB's next stage. Maybe we put an RFP out for the work, especially if we can include a cash award.
