## Triage Items
How are we using miro? Can we set up our own boards for collaborating in? (Rowan)
- one option: could have 2 boards - 1 GC and 1 "public"/community
- ACTION: We will set up individual private Miro boards for different projects/needs and share them with individual team members as needed

Designer to beautify ToC (Alex)
- Wrap this up in the larger identity design. @flashlight to hold and prioritise the ToC first when a designer is found and engaged 

Possibly talk about discord flow (Heenal)
- We are all on the same page with our confusion!
	- There's a DAO-lemma between transparency and privacy
	- Could make Squads public and Projects private. Or vice versa!
	- Action: We will each mull it over and see if we find any clarity. Find an idea to try and run an experiment.
- Blocker: Finalizing the guilds 
	- Heenal will follow up with @Lewwwk re this blocker and confirm with @remarkk and @Ryan
