	- Last week:
		- Call with Tracey & Sue
		- Tracey shared the learning questions below (we think that "the tool" = the playbook)
			- Can this be a tool to attract and mobilize more capital into the NFP sector
			- Does this tool enable greater diversity in the sources of capital into the sector. Where is the capital coming from 
			- Does this vehicle allow for some of the pressing challenges in phil sector to be addressed? 
			- Will these DAO cells actually | authentically shift power? Does it get us somewhere better than where we are now. And how will we know.  
			- How are the principles activated and practiced. Can it live up to the potential in practice? 
			- Who are the folks that this would attract.  
			- Does this tool drive greater civic | community engagement from folks that are typically not engaged? 
			- What does success look like? What does success look like for us given our place in the social purpose landscape
	- This week:
		- Need to respond to some questions for Tracey in order for her to move forward with getting sign-off from OTF
			- Rowan could walk Tracey through the governance model, or can we satisfy her and her CEO in a simpler way?
			- Michelle is talking with Tracey tomorrow
			- Michelle will share learning questions with Shanny
		- Meeting with Steve Waddell - 4pm Aug 8th

- #[dao primitives](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/dao%20primitives.md) 
	- Update on neighbourhood retrofit project - hit a speed bump but continuing positively  

## Triage/Discussion 
- Discussion about next steps with OTF 
- What the 'tax receipt' conversation points at -> a deep set norm focuses on an unrelated benefit or outcome. NFTs presented the opportunity that the contributor receives the NFT vs. a tax receipt, and that NFT could potential have future value based on the outcomes of the project. This feels pivotal for a mindset shift and is something that can be practically explored with the AIFS court projects (and what happens after the court is done). Some previous elaborations: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gPH5Ws-xGGldY3LmUTAx2u5TlmxrNUfdy_n38RtzN4U/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gPH5Ws-xGGldY3LmUTAx2u5TlmxrNUfdy_n38RtzN4U/edit?usp=sharing)
