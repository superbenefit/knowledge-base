## Projects
*** Discussed Revolution 2 & Beyond
-not sustainable with blood sweat and tears-is that consulting, raising capital, grants - not wanting to pre-suppose and don't want to perpetuate on grants with strings, or billing hours and consulting shop, are their ideas people have and directions feels right and nourishing for all of us for a long time to come and respects work because foundation.
-network creating being valuable and we participate in the value and network and nourished in important ways-delicate line to walk for financial opportunity and its role to play in creative challenging work-don't want a nonprofit vibe, here to do good work, and can't just be that-there seems to be something possible-All In For Sport model - idea that is charitable to create outcomes and this network and how incentivize in healthy ways, nouns funding model and every 10th noun creates economic side for those contributing, there is upside if successful-uncertain upside is a key part of those dynamics
-whatever funding model in abstract has to work in reality e.g. nouns worked in bear market, does it work in this moment
-core root of why SB exists - to facilitate the infrastructure to accelerate social and financial flysheets to transition society to these new foundations-help move steer those kind of initiatives, Krause House can demonstrate show how to transform a sector-patterns where take 3% for setting up or design a protocol, could take a stake in underlying asset for these transformations being built on web3 tooling and foundations-does not solve up front capital -short term, what starting to demonstrate in Northpine, with AIFS, we could think about how to transform philanthropic from grassroots from ground up, along with these other systemic initiatives with value unlocks-we are past get some tokens and go to the moon - AIFS, has to land sponsors to make it work, we can be a bit more realistic there has to be some recognition
-are we already testing with our current projects and experiments - SuperBenefit would get some allocation-e.g. transformation mapping token swap
-good intentions should not be married up - the lack of compensation has been to experiment, freedom, and not to hard wired and creating stress in other parts of life, still follow through with obligation but something in flexibility
-if more important to focus on things we want to do - rather than how will get compensate, they are experimental in what doing in world, or how get compensated-payment for activity, not sure if consultancy-what is our tolerancne to let things evolve including compensation
-three horizons so compelling, web3 and infrastucture is a contested space, and things blowing up are co-opting and focused on individual wealth creation-what moves from horizon 2 to horizon 3 rather than horizon 1 which is what is playing out now
-no future where this is not the foundation, how do we make it through this phase, we have this position of showing up in ways
-upside of current pressures is demanding more use cases of these kinds of technologies that are not setting the precedence of the past, use cases are undeniable but how to they enhance human cooperation
-AIFS - easy to see it can operation as a network, all these stakeholders participate in the network and there can be an economic mechanism that sits in balance, and how incentivized to contribute value in the most generative way
-what is not clear, what is the network we are forming, what is coherent about how different people will participate, how can support network and communicate, manage information
-two ecoystems - transformation/economic ecoystems and web3 ecosystem 
-what are other DAOs exploring
-hypercerts - model of retroactive funding for contributions, wonder how works in this smaller scale
-basic - it is reasonable to have a foundation or backer to provide a core like the Northpine Foundation, a backer that says is interested in finding new applications that drives systemic impact, 1M into treasury and figure out how to 
-Klima DAo specific call to action and mission, scale is available to them because that kind of clarity on chain  - clean intervention - not sure SB is clear 
-bridging the worlds - what are the ways to connect to other networks to accrue value
-how to nourish in between spaces of the cells/constellations
-testing Northpine approach - see some convos - transformation mapping in web3/incubation including governance design and funding mechanism design and building out core primitives and looking for support to test the primitives to apply to more things - use horizon 1 and horizon 3
-horizon 1, 2, 3 - approaches can have a coherent approach across all three horizons, not just future, networks that can straddle the world of long term vision and keep everything in between running between horizons
-all connected to different opportunities and projects - can we bring them into SuperBenefit as temporary projects 
-we need resources to support network/community, to do it well/very active and intensive role/even if allows that to happen/allows to be active on broader 
-rearticulating the emerging fields of activity - there is an engagement with trying to influence what is in digital native space and then how web3 enables transformation initiatives in analog physical world and there is the workshop element of building the primitive and the conceptual initiative of how things create value and new ways of thinking/stories - overlapping the world
-how nurture in base infrastructure to make sure projects not disconnected from broader SuperBenefit network of networks
-how to draw it out based on what we know today and how is it shaping up
-infrastructure - governance/systems transformation - how the network participates around the infrastructure that helps us think of future value - Northpine - network spinning up on other value structures, can be held by the network, is network the embodiment, subtle and emerging
-value of mobilizing collective intelligence through specific activity - Northpine/Windfall - general use case through coordinating info flows, different actors to better coordinate , distributed finance and participatory is Northpine - the energy will generate internally and externally - weaving and adaptation in different contexts 
-DAOs think way it works now will be how it works in future, and we don't want to fall into patterns
-DAO scale - instead of token - service swap, what could we ask for in return
-timing is part of challenge, AIFS pretty direct short term path for sponsorship dollars, SB to do governance and could apply for direct currency -10,000 Krause House for transformation mapping, may be an event later this year that may make it tradeable for fiat instead of holding as governance powerNorthpine - can propose for role we are playing-Windfall - budget is to help coordinate at $10K per month-if 2-3 of these things publicly visible 
Next Steps-keep connecting as projects emerge/another convo in future-create Figjam board to start to reflect and create ideas - WHO-OTF grant $50K request - proposal in process
