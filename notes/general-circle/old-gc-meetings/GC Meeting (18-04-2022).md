- ## Triage Items
	- What tensions do you have that need resolution to move forward in your work?
		- Allocating SPRB to projects we are working on internally and other new proposals that are creating budgets for GC and Projects (Rowan)
			- Use monthly 10k funding for
				1.  is for external people - fist-to-five in GC to decide 
				2. A monthly co-ordinape to allocate for internal contributors for activities on projects without budgets 
			- Individual projects that have budget can decide for themselves how they want to distribute tokens to core team and other contributors and externals 
			- Possibly find a way to distribute some SPRB to the discord community. Maybe a retro-active distribution to discord members who have contributed. Perhaps run a bounty for someone to research who has contributed and allocate them some tokens. @heenal and @MBaldwin to put together a short bounty maybe for @KColman do this research.
