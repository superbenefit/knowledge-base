- #[[P-261 Windfall - Residential Energy NFT]] 
	- Windfall update - Innovation dept natural resources canada wants to proceed with the project if they can. Looking promising 
	- would want done by end of March - 140k and 40k implementation original - 1M implementation budget and slight contribution to that for protocol implementation 
	- We can work on the design primitive - for accepting capital etc
	- Already got a municipal partner on board (very important for a project like this) and Windfall has a very deep network from 30+ years of work
	- Next steps: call tomorrow to confirm capacity and discuss changing proposal. Seems like they want to move quickly, so we should have more details in couple of weeks..
- Governance
	- BwB proposal has gone in - hope to hear back pretty soon
		- UK + Europe energy retrofit design. Community of ~1,000 people, solar retrofits, expect 20-30 sign-ups. DAO model around ownership and management of assets and income. Pilot could be in Manchester, England.
	- Working towards being able to package up the playbook - feels like we are making progress, and having a real project to do this for gives us more impetus to do it.
	- New legal wrappers are popping up and SB could potentially play a role showing when and how to use different models. Could be part of OTF project.
