## Triage Items
- What tensions do you have that need resolution to move forward in your work?
	- mindset shifts will be important to nudge on for systems transformation attributes/framework and stay open to new pathways and to layer in web3 context
	- @MBaldwin@Rowan  chatted and thought would pause on revenue discussion for SB while we get some of the projects/experiments going unless anyone else super keen - next step broader discussion about what is emerged and where SB may go next - complimentary things are building, partnerships with other DAOs, important to discuss income streams - Revolution 2 and beyond - @MBaldwin will set up meeting
		- Transformation Safari - engage in a process and test hypothesis, weaving new connections, co-creation of knowledge, $SPRB and NFT? - CCS elective as v0 for this concept
	- Should I send Aatif and Tanya a note about Northpine Foundation project?
	- DAO Cell in the non-DAO world - heenal
		- practices over outcomes , practices generally lead to certain outcomes rather than leading with outcomes and impact
		- cooperation and coherence is more of a systems level reconfiguration - collaboration can be narrower but can be fundamental creative unit with small groups with bandwidth, sometime a pattern of smaller collaborative units - more clarity around cooperation/coherence/collaboration
