Outline üìù SuperBenefit GC Notes üïû Started at 5:01PM on 24 Mar, lasted 1h 18m

Meeting Attendance and Check-In

- The meeting began with participants joining and noting that Michelle would be a few minutes late.

- Once most attendees had arrived, they conducted a brief check-in.

- Several participants reported feeling under the weather or experiencing 'Monday blues.'

- One person mentioned spending a long day with a relative receiving healthcare.

- Despite feeling tired or out of sorts, all expressed readiness to engage in the conversation.

Overview of Previous Discussions on Yield Fund

- The group reviewed their previous conversations about creating a yield fund structure.

- They had initially created a structure and were trying to determine its impact.

- After discussions with Brian from Bowen, they drafted potential impact areas.

- Questions arose about whether the current structure was the best approach for their impact fund idea.

- They explored different structures, including community fund models like Breadchain.

- Key questions emerged regarding investors finding yield generators elsewhere instead of getting returns through this fund.

- Another key question was what their unique value proposition would be.

- They realized they needed to dive deeper into determining the best structure and how it relates to the evolution of their previous work, particularly RPP.

- The goal was to gather everyone's thoughts, identify a clear structure to proceed with, and consider its pros and cons.

Discussion on Impact Focus and Fund Structure

- The conversation shifted to the importance of clearly defining the impact they aim to achieve.

- Participants noted that impact seemed to be an afterthought in their discussions, despite being crucial for potential stakeholders.

- They acknowledged the need to approach impact in a novel and effective way, potentially leveraging advancements in the Web3 space.

- Michael clarified that the yield fund approach was primarily focused on accessing available capital from endowment reserves for impact initiatives.

- This strategy aims to tap into capital currently inaccessible to the impact sphere, countering the trap of always requesting from the small pool of grant-making dollars.

- The group discussed the possibility of creating a local community fund for London or Southwest Ontario, potentially with a regenerative focus.

- Concerns were raised about differentiation from existing initiatives like Verge.

- They also considered the limitations of traditional fund structures versus more flexible Web3 native community-run mechanisms.
