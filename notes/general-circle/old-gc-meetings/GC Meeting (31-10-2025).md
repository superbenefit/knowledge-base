# Summary

- The team discussed the possibility of requesting an extension for the RPP OTF deadline, which is coming up at the end of April, potentially by one month.

- Rather presented a proposal for operational governance at All in for Sport, which aims to reverse-engineer some operational bylaws and port them back into the proposal to flesh it out.

- Filsan completed outlining the impact areas and the rationale for a fund, detailing where it fits in the ecosystem and the gap it fills, and plans to share it in Discord for feedback.

- The team explored the idea of starting a fund as a smart contract rather than a formal fund, discussing the potential benefits and mechanisms, including the use of Bread Chain as an example.

- Rather explained the Bread Chain mechanism, highlighting its use as a community currency and the possibility of creating a community fund that others can flow funds into in a trust-minimized way.

- The team discussed the potential yield and returns from DeFi investments, considering different risk appetites and the various options available.

- The concept of using decentralized finance and smart contracts to create a permissionless or creatively governed fund for contributory impact was emphasized, with a focus on making it understandable for traditional investors.

- The team agreed to map out different alternatives for the fund structure and decide on a path forward, with a focus on the benefits and potential challenges.

- The team decided to send a note to Brian and Panna to inform them about the ongoing design and impact area discussions, with a plan to reconvene next Monday to further discuss the ideas.

- The team considered extending the timeline for the RPP OTF grant report by one month to allow more time to complete experiments and gather learnings.
