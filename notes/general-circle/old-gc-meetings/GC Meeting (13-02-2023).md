## Triage Items
_What tensions do you have that need resolution to move forward in your work?_

NOTES

-are we conflating impact and transformation ?
-whether transformation improves in the direction we want-should we disaggregate -is it harder to see the impact -with impact we get stuck in a counting game, how big an impact it is and miss something more disruptive 
-repeatable process - adventure tours and bring it into institutions in explicit ways - teach ins and bring 30-50 people-pension funds as collectives and resources of people, long term capital thinkers, unique opportunity
-bridging example - how can be framed to what is immediately relevant to those groups-for example how frame for philanthropy would be different but not entirely different for pension funds - what is relevant for our future - 
-for philanthropy - often an ask is inherent - mindful of chasm of footloose experimentation in digitally native groups and other instit/orgs and how attitudes towards crypto space-opportunity of laying out what is going on can change attitudes, for big philanthropy is this money to put in and this is what we need to discover to inform
-big philanthropy - land in those power structures without an ask or directing, lay it out of the long term influences and what to think and not just what you should invest in or should act on - here is how this is working and how it is interesting 
-Itamar - people puzzle - working in people- centric role - early stage climate tech-primary job not only place to -Bankless DAO 1.5 yr old - so far DAO experience not great - hype buzz and creating community where purpose and fit not clear, still optimistic -connecting with BPetes - -DAOs started off as new thing and a set of defaults that very different than what existed before, not necessarily as better or effective, very close to those starting points, tokenized voting 
-questions from Itamar about permissionlessness and permeable structure - how go through proto DAO to create enough boundaries and constraints and is helpful not just chaos -soulbound tokens and reputation management systems-people who have power who are switched out, reputation systems,
