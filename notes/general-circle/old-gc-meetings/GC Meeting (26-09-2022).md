## Triage Items
- What tensions do you have that need resolution to move forward in your work?
	- Peter Gulka is keen to engage in SuperBenefit and has been added as contributor to Systems Transformation Repository/Library - curious if we might consider small amount of $SPRB token for those who making a commitment before the project is done. He had a sense he already had some. Just wondering if need to follow old patterns of do work/compensate work
