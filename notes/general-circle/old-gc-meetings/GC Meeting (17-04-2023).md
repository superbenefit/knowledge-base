	- Basically wrapped up
	- Possibility of developing an approach for AIFS around the Impact Map. Where we can invite community rounds to be spun up around opportunities in the map. If we focus on the basic qudratic funding/voting model that we can develop tooling and practice around - this will ensure that we are developing a coherent approach to a diverse set of micro grant rounds. Could be good to include in the Ontario Trillium foundation ideas below too.

## Triage
- Notes on Trillium funding project - perhaps work on some of the tools that would be needed for AIFS but develop them earlier and in partnership with the grant 
- Possibly use AIFS funding rounds with athlete foundations - to spin up a round in Ontario - this could give us the opportunity to test the community signal components of AIFS that we will have to do in the future
