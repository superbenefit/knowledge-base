# Purpose
This document is an opportunity for #[[squad lead]] contributors to highlight their contributions, and those of others, in order for #[[squad lead]] contributors to capture a sense of relative contribution during Revolution 0. We will use [Coordinape](http://coordinape.com) to facilitate this process and use the results in determining all or part of the final allocation of the remaining 800k Rev 0 contribution allocation. 
# Process
1. Review the contributions noted so far.
2. Under your name, make note of any contributions you think others might consider in your determining allocation. In particular, think of contributions you have made to:
	- The origin and creation of SuperBenefit
	- Realizing the objectives of #[[revolution 0- foundations]] 
	- Furthering the SuperBenefit #[[ethos]].
3.  Feel free to note contributions of others, including others who are not #[[squad lead]] but you would like to recognize.
4. Message Lewwwk when you have completed your first pass on this document.
5. Lewwwk will notify everyone to take a final review before the contribution allocation event.
