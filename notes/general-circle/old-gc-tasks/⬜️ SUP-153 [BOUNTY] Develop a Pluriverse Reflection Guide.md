## Background
The Pluriverse artifact at pluriverse.world - and the movement that is gathering around it - represents an opportunity to shape the values of web3 and of future human society. The pluriverse text could be a great conversation/reflection prompt for a 30-60 minute session in any DAO/discord/group involved in web3. 
We can come up with a simple facilitation guide and worksheet help people host those kinds of conversations. Is it a useful way to reflect on how their community and their ambitions relate to that doc. Where is alignment strongest? Where is it weakest? What new ideas does it inspire about their mission? What new ideas does it inspire about their DAO?

## Desired Results
- A 2 page step-by-guide for facilitators to follow, including some specific wording/questions to use, and timings
	- Include options for different sized groups, with possible individual reflection sessions, writing prompts, and/or break-out sessions
- A worksheet or some other method for capturing reflections and learnings and sharing them with both Verses DAO and SuperBenefit DAO

## Bounty Details

- Bounty Reward: 100 $SPRB
