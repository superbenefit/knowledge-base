## Background
“Without inner change there can be no outer change. Without collective change, no change matters.”
— angel Kyodo williams
Reflective practice enables us to achieve a better awareness of ourselves, our knowledge and understanding, our skills and competencies, our goals and desires, and the community and the world around us.
DAOs (and web3 ventures in general) tend to work at a fast pace, and FOMO culture is commonplace. if we are to co-create a better world, we need to unlearn some bad habits from the default world. To do systems change we need to create the space and time for inner work and unlearning; we need to slow down, pause, and take time to reflect.
At this early stage in its development, SuperBenefit has the opportunity to embed reflective practice as a key element of our community culture. As part of the Community Experience Circle's work, a culture and practice of reflection will attract new members and contributors, improve morale and retention, distinguish SuperBenefit from other DAOs, and result in decisions that better enable SuperBenefit to move towards its Purpose.
Daniel Kharlas is a SuperBenefit community member who has many years of experience leading meditations and reflective practice sessions for the London Mindfulness Community. Daniel has started outlining a range of reflective practices (on Miro) and their applicability to SuperBenefit, and is developing a reflection framework for SuperBenefit, together with a web-based app to capture members' reflections, parse them using AI, and display them visually. These "harvests" of community reflections will:
- inform SuperBenefit's ongoing activity
- serve as a historical record of SuperBenefit's evolution
- have the potential to become collectable NFTs in their own right

## Proposal
@MBaldwin & @heenal propose to create the **Reflection Practice Coordinator** role in the Community Experience Squad with the following remit:
-  Develop a framework for reflective practice that suits the needs of the SuperBenefit community 
- Host discussion circles inviting reflection on web3-related topics
- Help to embed a culture of reflection within the SuperBenefit community

I further propose to invite Daniel Kharlas to fill the Reflection Practice Coordinator role, noting his experience in this field, the work that he has already put into researching a reflective framework for SuperBenefit, and his keenness to engage with our community.
## Action
In sharing this Proposal on Discord, I am seeking the consent of the Community Experience Squad to the Proposal above.
## Result
Approved unanimously at the January 12, 2022 meeting of the Community Experience Squad.
