@MBaldwin Where's this at? Is this an ongoing/repeated action? Does it still make sense to keep this task on this board?
@heenal do you have any DAO community experience leads you could suggest I could connect with, Michael mentioned being careful what we ask for so I have been hesitant without a relationship connection

In progress - Feb 8 connecting with Cary Tan from Crypto Culture and Society and she is making some intros
