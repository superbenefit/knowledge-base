Cap of 20ETH raise unless we get a subdomain (this might not apply, i'll start making enquiries).
@flashlight  Here are some more details on the actual implementation we'll be using on Mirror.
- this is the guide for our approach
	- [https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/editions](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/editions) 
- we can go as low as 0.01 ETH
- we can make the top one a 1/1 auction that goes to the highest bidder (i'm not confident that would work yet for us)
- we have to set max mumbers for each it looks like. e.g.
	- Legendary, 5/5, 1 ETH
	- Rare, 50/50, 0.1 ETH
	- Common, 500/500, 0.01 ETH
- this is an example of that approach: [https://eco.mirror.xyz/8_z5JQrhmCAVSU6vi4V7_r7M6HQ-pOWuAVdTNPPtIJY](https://eco.mirror.xyz/8_z5JQrhmCAVSU6vi4V7_r7M6HQ-pOWuAVdTNPPtIJY) 
- Note: this is how they show up on opensea, under a mirror collection without customizable project details. [https://opensea.io/assets/0xdf5b5ee15cc96ba7d0cb6bd9b2c0fc4417ab6445/311](https://opensea.io/assets/0xdf5b5ee15cc96ba7d0cb6bd9b2c0fc4417ab6445/311)
