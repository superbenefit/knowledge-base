## Background
- The Community Experience Squad's function is growing and we need more capacity (contributors) in order to be effective.
	- ### Discord community guide
		- It's important to make new community members feel welcome and to guide them towards participation and contribution
		- Note: let's avoid the word “moderator” because a) “moderator” has a particular meaning in terms of Discord permissions; b) “guide” feels a bit less top-down/authoritarian
	- ### web3 Librarian
		- The [SuperBenefit web3 library](https://www.notion.so/superbenefit/web3-Library-7819e3c7a9fb482998cad3822e5dcb82) has been established. It needs to be maintained, improved and added to in order to remain a relevant and useful resource.
	- ### Writer/scribe
		- A large number of meetings take place inside DAO's every day, and because people work asynchronously, this means there is a great need for people to record and summarize events, meetings, and discussions.


## Proposal
@MBaldwin & @heenal propose to create the following roles in the Community Experience Squad:
- ### Discord community guide
	- Responsibilities
		- Make members feel welcome
		- Encourage conversation and sharing
		- Encourage members to engage with guilds
		- Ensure community guidelines are followed
		- Refer community members to previous posts in Discord or other resources that might be helpful to them
		- Do anything else to help build community
	- Specific tasks:
		- Welcome new members! Reply to their introductions, maybe even reach out to them if they don't introduce themselves.
		- Check which members have selected different roles and if they are not active, encourage them to get active in the appropriate Guild channel(s)
		- Check Discord at least once a day, and reply to any comments that need replying to. For example:
			1. Answer people’s questions (if you know the answer!) or direct them to a team member who might be able to help
			2. Let people know about workshops, events and projects of SuperBenefit (and in the wider community) that could be of interest to them, based on their comment
		- Let people know if they are breaking the group rules, and gently ask them to change their behaviour. 
		- Share important messages with a call to action. Don’t overdo this - usually no more than one or two posts per week.
		- Celebrate milestones (eg 150 members in the Discord server) and thank everybody for being a part of the community
		- Post a daily "Question of the Day" in the general channel (tbc)
		- If there have been no posts in a particular channel for 2-3 days, consider posting something to start a conversation
- ### web3 librarian
	- Responsibilities
		- maintain the web3 library
			- add resources
			- add summaries
			- tag and categorize resources
			- remove resources that are outdated or low quality (with squad lead approval)
		- promote the web3 library
		- find new ways to present information (learning pathways, subject guides, visuals, video/podcast collections, etc)
	- Specific tasks
		- At least 2-3 times per week, check for any feedback on the library and respond
		- Weekly, check Discord for resources that have been shared and add the best ones to the library
		- Monthly, check all links in the library to make sure that none are broken, outdated, or have been superseded by more recent resources
		- On an ongoing basis, review the copy in the Library to make sure that we are providing good introductions/summaries of the articles 
- ### Writer/scribe
	- This role suits someone who loves writing, loves listening and loves harvesting key insights and finding threads and patterns. You should be passionate about web3 and SuperBenefit's mission and be able to communicate that passion effortlessly in your writing, to help get SB's community as excited as you are! It's also helpful to have good attention to detail, timekeeping and organizational skills.
	- Responsibilities:
		- Capture summaries of meetings (Town Hall, Welcome Party, ToC review session, etc), turn notes into prose
		- Write updates, announcements and invitations to share with the SB Community
		- Ensure writings are organized well on Notion/Clarity and publicize them
		- Optional: attend Twitter spaces hosted by others and capture notes
		- Optional: write articles to communicate key topics to SB members in a clear way
