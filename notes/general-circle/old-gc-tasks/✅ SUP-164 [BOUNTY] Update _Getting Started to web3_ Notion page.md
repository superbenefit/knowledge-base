## Background
- The current "Getting started with web3" page on SuperBenefit's Community Resources Notion site feels incomplete and needs to be reworked
- The end goal is not onboarding people to web3, it's how can we onboard people into our vision of what web3 could be

## Links
- [Current Getting Started page](https://www.notion.so/superbenefit/Getting-Started-with-web3-0618fe7d45dc4575843a9396f7e12c8a) (Notion)
- [Notes on web3 library and Getting Started page](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/0e6dce33-a3f4-47dc-ae80-dd95116c72cd) from conversation with @Jai 
- [New Getting Started content](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YuPy2dJHavTrFtoTEJfyq5x8NzC4aQUmCC53kRpOAY8/edit) drafted by @Jai (Google Doc)
- Related Task: #[164 [BOUNTY](164%20[BOUNTY) 

## Desired Results
- Revamp the page so that it covers the following topics:
	- What is web3?
	- What is a wallet?
	- What are NFTs?
	- What is a DAO?
	- How can web3 be used for impact? (share brief examples - Klima etc)
	- Why does web3 matter? What is SuperBenefit, what are we trying to, and why does that matter?
- Keep the page "skimmable" with headings, short paragraphs and external links (include video/audio links to account for for different learning styles)
