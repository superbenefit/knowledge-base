## Background
Currently, only General Circle members hold $SPRB. While we are publishing bounties and developing other mechanisms to reward Rev 1 contributors, it is also desirable to distribute some $SPRB to the SuperBenefit Discord community to thank them for their contributions and to encourage them to participate in governance. A retroactive distribution could be based on each community member's participation in Discord, as codified by their "Level" on the Mee6 leaderboard here: [https://mee6.xyz/leaderboard/874697948838101092](https://mee6.xyz/leaderboard/874697948838101092) 
## Desired Results
- $SPRB is distributed to at least 10 new wallets, with the amount of $SPRB distributed to each wallet in some way related to that user's contribution in Discord

## Process to follow
- Determine a fair way of distributing the total allocation of $SPRB based on the level, rank or other characteristics of Discord members
- Confirm from #[[general circle]] the total amount of $SPRB to allocate to this process
- Post a message (and a subsequent reminder) in Discord to let users know about this distribution and ask them to reply with their ETH address within 7 days in order to receive their share of $SPRB
- Produce a list of ETH addresses with corresponding amounts of $SPRB to send to each wallet and send that to #[[treasury squad]] to execute the token distribution

## Bounty Details
- Estimated effort: 3-4 hours
- Bounty Reward: 150 $SPRB
- Due date: May 16, 2022
- Reporting to Heenal as part of #[[community experience squad]]
