## Objective 
Launch our first NFT series in order to:
1. Bootstrap the treasury
2. Provide a foundation for future engagement and NFT projects
3. Get into as many wallets as possible

## Design principles
- Build the SuperBenefit story
- Be as simple as possible
- It should be alive, responsive to how it is used
- Owners should feel it will bring them significant value over time
- Owners should feel attached to it (this is more important over time)

## Lore
It begins with a spark. A collision of energy between two entities. Illuminating the hidden connections that exist between us and the world around us. 
A lone spark may leave a mark but quickly burns out, a temporary signal of connection/interaction. 
A concentration of sparks though can creates fire - a catalyst for change in the environment around us. 
Each of our initial contributors are a spark - Individually each providing their small bit of energy, but when concentrated they all provide the energy needed to start our fire and help start turning the gears that drive SuperBenefits flywheels.  
The NFT Series 0 sparks provide a lasting representation of the early contributors to SuperBenefits success. 
Acquirers of the Series 0 will also automatically receive the Ember NFT, SuperBenefits Soul Token, when its ready to be released. This ember NFT will be the symbol used by all of our community to show their ongoing support and their contribution to keeping out fire burning. Each NFT will be equipped with features that change the NFT based on the owner's contributions to Superbenefit (Financial/Community) as well as other attributes TBD.    
## Features
- Core
	- "Ember Token": One per wallet max
		- encourage people to invest in one nft
	- NFT image represents a single node
	- NFT contains two contribution scores
		- Financial  'score' that is influenced by user actions
		- Action
	- Counter (token id)
	- Version
- Questions:
	- what can trigger score updates, and how does that happen?
	- how would we have image respond to scores (how does that get update)
	- do we need to capture a 'creation date' (or can that just be called as a property)
	- can we dynamically grab the total/avereage/top of each score across the collection
- Mint Site
	- Off-chain resources required at mint
		- Record of any existing financial and activity contributions by eth address
	- Connect wallet
	- Prepopulate scores based on address
	- Add eth
	- Mint
- **_"Feed the Tamagotchi"_**

## TBD
- Can we avoid needing a mint site? Most complicating features are
	- allowing people to put variable amounts into their nft
	- enabling token aware sharing
	- Mint site examples:
		- [https://cryptocoven.xyz/](https://cryptocoven.xyz/) 
		- [https://www.plantfriendtree.com/details](https://www.plantfriendtree.com/details) 
		- [https://mint.shinyobjects.gg](https://mint.shinyobjects.gg/) 
- Creating sense of potential future value or interest. Potential hooks:
	- Signal ohm fork ahead (careful not to position this as an investment with expectation for profit - flips it into a security)
	- Utility in voting to deploy the treasury, or access to other things in the future
	- Curiosity for what might be coming ahead. "What could this turn into?"
	- Desire to be part of something
- What is the art?
- Which chain?
- Which marketplace?
- Number of NFT's?
- Cost of NFT's? Low cost or free?

## For Future Series
- Network representations
- Different illustrations
- Different interactions (prompts)
- Proposals for other representations and uses of the nftt
