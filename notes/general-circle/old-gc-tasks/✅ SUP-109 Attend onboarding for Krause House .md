Used gather.town and sli.do
No video, don’t even see people’s faces. No check-in, no member to member talk
Couldn’t even see speakers’ faces. Is this because of pseudonimity?
History
What is KH
What is a DAO
1. Dig around in the DAO, attend meetings, build context….I promise you that you will organically find ways to contribute.
2. Talk to “agents”. Dm us, talk to ask us questions, ask us what’s going on. we are literally here to guide you and to be your steward. Shared a slide showing exactly how to DM an agent
3. We have a team that we are building out with the sole purpose of helping people who interact with the DAO (and are serious) contribute to it
4. You can work part-time, but do good work. Do little but do it well.
5. Dogstoevsky is not a basketball fan at all. Has not even seen a game! Loved the idea of crowdsourcing resources and intelligence as a really cool use case for a DAO. This is not just a basketball DAO, we are at the bleeding edge of onboarding, governance, operations… I became involved and stayed involved because this is just so cool!
6. Ok if you don’t know about DAOs. They are building out their KH university project
7. Private discord channel created for cohort “draft class”
8. Split into breakout groups but it didn’t really work
