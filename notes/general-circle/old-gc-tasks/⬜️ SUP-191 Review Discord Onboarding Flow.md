Following the crowdfund launch, it is incumbent upon us to review the Onboarding Flow to ensure that newcomers to SB's Discord server can quickly get an overview of SB's goals and current status, and can understand how to engage and "what to do next". 
Below we review the current onboarding flow, its challenges, and some possible solutions.

## Suggestions
1. Hide the #new-arrivals,  #faq and #important-links channels until the User has been verified in the #verify channel.
	- @Ryan  Does this sound good to you?
2. Use the Zira message in #verify to share some introductory info about SB, instead of the generic current message "React here to gain basic access to the server". Perhaps we could put the whole message that is currently in #start-here into the #verify channel instead?
	- @Ryan  I'm not sure about this. I'd be curious to hear your thoughts?
3. Update the Rules screen to include a welcome message that is more clearly centered on the User's onboarding experience rather than being an introduction to what SB is and does. Update the Rules so that they are less generic and more focussed on the kind of engagement with SB that we are inviting people into.
	- @MBaldwin Let's discuss how what these rules could be and seek input from the rest of the team
	- ⬜️ SUP-197 Update Rules screen on Discord 
4. We currently don't have a welcome screen active. We could set up a welcome screen with a short paragraph plus a link to the #start-here to make sure people go there first.
	- @Ryan  This might not be necessary, depending on what we do with points 2 and 3 above, but I'm including it here as an option. These decisions need to be considered together. Maybe we can chat about it some time?
5. Overhaul the FAQ so that it includes the background and invitations from the Mirror post
	- @heenal will work on this
6. Once the 1-2 intro video is ready, include this prominently in the onboarding flow.
	- @flashlight is working on the video
7. There are a lot of channels that open up under "community" once the verification is completed. I think it's too many channels and could feel overwhelming.
	- #suggestions-and-questions - the "questions" function should be part of #help-desk. Let's give this channel a more clear focus by renaming it "ideas-and-suggestions"

	- #important-links - This could be moved into the welcome section, above FAQ
	- #new-to-web3 - Right now, I think the best section to put this in would be "knowledge sharing". We have talked about a separate "interests" section but I'm not sure we're ready for that yet
	- #off-topic - Not sure where to put this one! Maybe it could go under "knowledge sharing" but that doesn't quite fit with the name. The channel's not being used so maybe we don't even need it right now?!
8. We have 6 invitations in the Mirror post, but no clear way for people to indicate their interest in a particular invitation and engage with that invitation.
	- Could we include the 6 invitations in the role channel and ask people to select a role AND an invitation?
	- Or we could have a separate channel (similar to #role-selection) to indicate which invitation you are drawn to
	- Not sure of the best approach here. @Lewwwk @Ryan @remarkk any thoughts on this??


Steve Waddell feedback
On Come, Make Better Faster: You say "join us on Discord"...but there's no explanation about what Discord is...it would perhaps be good to say "we have a community space on Discord, an app that hosts communities that SuperBenefit uses."  I originally thought it was something SuperBenefit had created.
At the Start Here on Discord:  It's unclear whether the Help desk is for Discord (the app) or SuperBenefit, the community.
There's reference to a "Guild Channel" with no explanation of what it is.  
At the bottom of the FAQs, it says "If you’re not comfortable using Discord yet, feel free to reach out to [Michelle](https://twitter.com/ml_baldwin) or [Heenal](https://twitter.com/heenalr) from our Community Experience team via Twitter instead."  Not everyone uses Twitter, but everyone uses email...email addresses would be much better.
You have a help desk for Discord, but I was left originally thinking it was for SuperBenefit, too...it would be good to say where to go for SuperBenefit help in the same paragraph.
in the page of FAQs, the response to the question **Who is a part of SuperBenefit** is incomplete...it ends with "Now that we have [published our Mirror post](https://mirror.xyz/superbenefit.eth/8Icbwygio4EJfEvh8we9Xz4IcZxzWfjyzmlMGXlxxjc), we"
You ask people to choose a role, but there's no explanation of what the roles are or the implications of choosing one (except I get access to the Guild channel).  Moreover, it is not clear HOW to choose one, or what happens if I do choose one.  It would be good to have maybe an email welcoming me to the choice.
The SuperBenefit Website seems extremely underdeveloped.  The key thing I look for is "who is this?", and there is no mention of individuals or organizations here or at the mirror posting.
