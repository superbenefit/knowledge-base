# KrauseHouse Collaboration Proposal
[Krause House](http://krausehouse.club) is a DAO that formed around the mission to buy an NBA team. As it has progressed, [it has realized that it's work is aligned with bringing forth the future of sport](https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/IZm6c5XN58msf_f-UVPmOWLTJfSUwSuB80j8mYjfBZA). 
As a Krause House Steward, initiator of the Purpose and Values team, and Capital Coordination lead, Lewwwk believes that Krause House could benefit from the development of 'transformation map', building on the learning from SuperBenefit's own theory of change work.
This is a proposal to collaborate with Krause House in developing a transformation map for the future of sport.
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to prototype DAO2DAO collaborations with DAOs that have transformative potential, where we might be able to assist through collaborative sense making and direction setting related to transformation.
## Design 
[A proposal has been prepared by the Krause House Purpose and Values](https://www.notion.so/krausehousework/Roadmapping-the-future-of-sport-4d586308921b414dbd4d80ce429f7e62 ) team based on a draft provided by AlexH and Lewwwk. A token swap approach was initially suggested by a Krause House Steward. The former Director of Operations for Seedclub will be leading this project within Krause House and AlexH would lead the work for SuperBenefit.
## Momentum
This has been in draft for a few months waiting for the appropriate time to introduce it. With completion of the Purpose and Values team's initial work stream and the introduction of an updated '[Game Plan](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x97f85099d9e0727fe49f31638e9e42d4148478ace5f88aab5147efc29494fd11)' for Krause House, the timing seems appropriate.
## Action
With this proposal we seek to approve an allocation of upto 50,000 $SPRB to support this work based on the discretion of AlexH. 
The current proposed allocation is as follows:
- Token Swap: 20,000 $SPRB in exchange for 10,000 $KRAUSE
- Optional Bonus Swap at Krause House discretion: 20,000 $SPRB for 10,000 $KRAUSE
- Internal Team Budget: 10,000 $SPRB

As project lead, Alex H will have final authority to accept or reject the final collaboration terms and determine SuperBenefit team setup, provided that total $SPRB allocation commitments do not exceed 50,000 $SPRB.
Upon agreement of final terms with Krause House, Alex H will invite SuperBenefit team members to the project, establish a multi-sig on Polygon, and request Treasury allocates the Internal Team Budget of 10,000 $SPRB (Polygon) to the team multi-sig. 
Additionally:
- Any and all $KRAUSE received through the scope of this proposal will be deposited directly into the primary SuperBenefit multi-sig at: 
	- [0x731c837121C15e1e7e3cfc0E2588f4d0B35FdD48](http://etherscan.io/address/0x731c837121C15e1e7e3cfc0E2588f4d0B35FdD48)
- By request to treasury, any agreed token swap issuance of $SPRB to Krause House committed through the scope of this proposal will issued directly from Polygon $SPRB held in SuperBenefit treasury wallet at: 
	- [0x9C3e186d24432f07847460aFa741f98a039AD57d](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x9c3e186d24432f07847460afa741f98a039ad57d)
