Use the Governance research project (currently at proposal stage) to experiment with some new governance design ideas. 
- This project is based around some ideas @Lewwwk and @Rowan  have being discussing around the inversion of centralised authority and fractal governance structure for DAOs. We will use #[222 Proposal for Governance Research Project](222%20Proposal%20for%20Governance%20Research%20Project) as an opportunity to test out some of these ideas 
- The broad concept is about creating archetypal individual creative units that operate in the same way with respect to governance and decision-making. A unit can be a large DAO or a small project within a DAO or between DAOs. The idea is that this creates a fractal system were each unit/node networks with other unit/nodes in a way that produces a decentralised but coherent and highly leveraged whole. Details of this (very much) work in progress can be seen here [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVODY0_-c=/](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVODY0_-c=/)  )_Note: because we are using free Miro accounts this is read only. Let me know if you want to contribute content or comments and I will add you to the board._)
- This represents early design thinking and needs to be iterated and evolved towards something that can actually work. But rather than just working on the theoretical underpinnings we are going to start testing these ideas out starting with this first project.
