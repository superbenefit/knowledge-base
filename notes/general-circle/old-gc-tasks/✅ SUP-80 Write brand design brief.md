Make better faster. SuperBenefit is a DAO accelerating a better future.
Our purpose is to embed _universal abundance*_ into the core infrastructure of the future. Every couple of generations new societal infrastructure systems appear that our societies run on. The internet is the most recent example. The values that were baked into the infrastructure of the original internet shaped the systems build on top, and allowed for massive concentration of power. We believe that blockchain is the next infrastructure revolution, and that this is a moment to accomplish exponential change. By building better values into the core infrastructure, we can shape all the systems built atop it.
We're doing this by developing social and financial flywheels that enable invention and investment to accelerate the arrival of a better world. Not only can we shape the future, we can create massive value in the process.
We have a vision, and the audacity and community to actually do it. Our founding team includes people with the real world skill and experience to make this happen. We have depth in systems change, governance, community building, communications, and technology. 
It's time for us to define our visual brand language. 
_*WTF is universal abundance? To us "universal" includes the planet and everyone and everything on it, and "abundance" means thriving health and prosperity._
**What we believe**
SuperBenefit is optimistic, driven, smart, and focused. We're not here to fuck around and make ourselves feel good. We're here to do the work. Our values are clear:
1 Believe in betterIt starts here. We believe in better even over cynicism. We value skepticism but won’t let it stop us. Our optimism is our superpower. 
2 Act into beingDreams only take us to the starting line. Nothing happens without doing. See something that needs to happen? Do it. 
3 Explore and experimentThe systems that got us here aren’t going get us there. We’re playing at the forefront of the moment. New systems need new models. Go, connect things in weird ways. See what happens.
4 Seek leverageStrive for exponential returns on everything: on effort, on value, on love. Work on problems that shape systems and solve other problems.
5 Learn and scaleOpen source everything. Publish plug and play modules for others to use and iterate on.
6 Together for all, for generations to comeEverything we do is in service of universal abundance.
Our brand should communicate
- optimism
- a seriousness of purpose
- high capability

Our tone is 
- personal
- witty
- confident
- fun

**Deliverables**
We're looking for
- an identity, including a word mark and an icon
- a short style guide, including type and colour palette. The style guide should be as brief as possible, and easy to share with a distributed team. A single updatable web page would be ideal, but a PDF works too.
