# Background
- SuperBenefitDAO and [Windfall Ecology Centre](https://windfallcentre.ca) have been in discussions to partner on the development of a stakeholder-led dynamic energy-labelling NFT protocol.
- Windfall has developed industry leading tools that allow residential users to measure and assess their energy usage, efficiency and emissions. 
- With the development of an NFT energy-labelling protocol; what is currently a large set of discrete individual users (with their own data sets) will be networked together and create an ecosystem of innovation around environmentally conscious energy usage. Crucially this will utilise the tools and ethos of web3: 
	- Users' data sovereignty will be designed into the system in a principled way. 
	- And the system as a whole will be designed as open-source and composable web3 infrastructure.
- **To kick this off we are proposing that SuperBenefit submit a grant application in partnership with Windfall to this Canadian government climate grants [programme](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy-efficiency/homes/toward-net-zero-homes-and-communities/toward-net-zero-homes-and-communities-applicant-guide/24508).**
- This application is **due on Sept 21** so this is time critical.

# Proposal
## Purpose
- This project is deeply aligned with SuperBenefit's overarching purpose "**to embed universal abundance into the core infrastructure of the future."**
- It is about supporting the development of infrastructure that will unlock currently closed networks of energy consumption data and allow for communities to develop the tools they need to transform the energy sector.   

## Design
- If we are successful in this application SuperBenefit will support the spinning up of a DAO that will develop a dynamic energy-labeling NFT protocol.
-  We will recommend allocating a minimum of $120,000 of funding over one year to establish and coordinate the DAO including establishing: governance, transparency, stakeholder engagement, co-design, planning and resourcing. 
- We will do this using combined insights emerging from the DAO Primitive project and Transformation Mapping work as well as other knowledge and insights from across the SuperBenefit network and beyond.

## Momentum 
- Talks have been ongoing with Windfall. Lewwwk, as well as being part of the SuperBenefit general circle, also sits on the governance board of Windfall. 
- Michelle, Alex and Rowan are also involved in pushing this application forward. 
- We have indications that there is a good likelihood of our application being successful, and regardless of the application's success, there is good likelihood of interest, participation, and support from others.

## Action 
- SuperBenefit will partner with Windfall to apply for this [grant program](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy-efficiency/homes/toward-net-zero-homes-and-communities/toward-net-zero-homes-and-communities-applicant-guide/24508) to raise grant funding for the project.
- Michelle, Alex, Rowan and Lewwwk will collectively work on the application process. 
- If successful, or if there is interest in proceeding in advance of the grant decision, we will propose the set up of the project separately.
