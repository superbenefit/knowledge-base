## Background
A clear purpose, mission and values are important for SuperBenefit to scale as a DAO. If effective, they allow for collective action that is decentralized but consistent in it's aims, direction, and approach.
SuperBenefit began as a hunch that what was emerging under the banner of 'web3' was a set of technologies that were enabling new interventions and infrastructures that are uniquely able to flip failing systems and accelerate the arrival of a better future that systematically improves wellbeing, sustainability, and prosperity while addressing our existential crises of climate and inequality.
I, @Lewwwk, registered the domain, twitter account, and setup a discord server in August 2021.  As the community has grown it is time to adopt a v0 purpose, mission, and values to align our activity and iterate on collectively, over time.
## Proposal
I propose that we adopt the following purpose, mission, and values as the SuperBenefit Ethos.
My rationale for adopting these as presented are:
- As presented, these represent the original intent in the creation of SuperBenefit
- The community was invited to make a final round of contributions before these were written (see discord post on December 21st [here](https://discord.com/channels/874697948838101092/915271780007043072/922980340069441537))
- The proposed ethos incorporates inputs and perspectives from the community as collected in the [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_llbEduw=/?invite_link_id=232853217905) as our community has grown, and were co-authored with @remarkk and @flashlight.
- While no version of these will be right for everyone, they reflect what's true for us for now.
