# What are guilds?
- Guilds are groups formed around skills or specific types of contribution that we currently need.
- Guilds provide an easy way for someone to be connected to opportunities to contribute, and to share their expertise.
- Guilds provide a pool of potential contributors that Squad and Project Leads can tap into

# What guilds are not?
- general interest groups
- 1:1 mapping to a squad (e.g. there wouldn't be a Treasury guild, but the Treasury squad might want to tap into a DeFi guild. There wouldn't be a Governance Guild, but the Governance Squad might want to tap into hosting and facil guild)

# Naming guilds
Guild names should be:
- short
- consistent in style with other guilds
- make sense with ‘Guild’ appended
- understandable to people who are new to SuperBenefit

# Which guilds do we need?
Hell yes [CONFIRMED FOR IMPLEMENTATION]
- community hosting
- facilitation
- engineering and development

- memes, media, and marketing
