# SuperBenefit DAO Governance Concept v1
SuperBenefit needs an initial governance structure to support its work, creating a framework for future evolution as the DAO evolves. The min spec of governance is whatever is fit for purpose to get to the NFT drop without damaging future contributors and the long-run success of the initiative towards its Purpose.
## Design Principles
- Minimum viable governance, only as much as we need
- Attracts energy, skills and contributions
- Creates clarity of action and forward momentum
- Rewards #[contributor role](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/contributor%20role.md)for their efforts
- Respects the autonomy of Contributors working to advance SuperBenefit's Purpose
- Key decisions and actions are documented and transparent to all

## Governance Structure
- [$sprb](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/$sprb.md)
	- We will reward work of Contributors with tokens (based on a formula TBD), which will include a token to be used in DAO governance.
	- Contributors use their governance tokens in voting on major strategic decisions of SuperBenefit DAO.
	- Holders of the governance tokens have the authority to change the Purpose of the General Circle through a proposal, reaction, discussion and integration process.
	- Holders of the governance tokens have the authority to elect/appoint the General Circle Lead.
- [general circle](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/general%20circle.md)
	- The primary decision making body, connecting and integrating the work of all Squads.
	- The General Circle members include the General Circle Lead, the Leads of Squads plus any additional Roles that the Circle may create to further its work.
	- The General Circle Lead sets strategy and priorities, and together with other members of the Circle, steers the initiative towards its Purpose. Currently, this role is played by @Lewwwk.
	- The General Circle Lead is accountable to the holders of governance tokens, who have the authority to change who fills the General Circle Lead role.
	- The General Circle can decide to bring important strategic decisions to the Contributors for a vote.
	- The General Circle is responsible for overall structure: it creates Squads and sets their Purpose, and can remove Squads when they are no longer needed
- [squads](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/squads.md) (or sub-circles)
	- We will organize work into Squads (referred to as sub-circles in Holacracy), which are created by the General Circle.
	- Each Squad has a Purpose it is pursuing and/or a domain that it controls. All Contributors actively contributing to the Circle's Purpose are members of the Squad.
	- Each Squad has a Lead, who is invited into the role by the General Circle Lead
- [squad lead](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/squad%20lead.md)
	- Leads help a Squad or Circle move forward by setting priorities, and inviting **Contributors** into work. They also have the ability to remove individual Contributors from that Squad or Circle if they are keeping it from moving forward.
	- Leads can invite other Squad or Circle members into the roles of **Facilitator** (convening and facilitating group process) and/or **Secretary** (documenting key decisions and outcomes) as needed

## Governance Processes
- Squad or Circle [tactical meetings](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/tactical%20meetings.md)
	- Squads or Circles will establish a regular cadence of Tactical Meetings, which are used to review KPIs, clear blockers to key projects, prioritize work in progress or make key decisions.
	- Tactical Meetings and their outcomes are transparently documented and shared in the relevant Discord channel.
- [decision-making](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/decision-making.md)
	- In general, decisions should be made by the Contributor who is taking action in service of a Squad or Circle's Purpose, unless that action is likely to impact the work of others in the Squad or Circle. They can test this assumption of autonomy by sharing the intent of their action in the relevant channel and asking for advice.
	- Squads or Circles make their significant decisions by Contributors surfacing tensions (gaps or opportunities) and asking for advice or seeking consent to a Proposal in the relevant channel.
	- Proposals are tested for consent (asynchronously for 24 hours in Discord, or real-time in a meeting of the Squad or Circle) using a "Fist-to-Five" vote:
		- Fist (or zero) - I completely object to this direction
		- 1 - I strongly object to the proposal as written
		- 2 - I have serious concerns that need to be heard
		- 3 - I have concerns or improvements, but could probably live with it
		- 4 - I support the proposal and think it can be approved
		- 5 - I completely agree with the proposal as written
	- Reactions to the proposal (supportive or not) are shared in the channel and the Proposer decides whether to integrate that feedback into a new and improved proposal until they achieve consent (all 3 or above), or decide to take a different action that moves their tension forward.
- Contributor Voting 
	- Contributors only use their governance tokens to vote on questions of fundamental purpose, mission, values and strategic objectives, in addition to the appointment of the General Circle Lead.
	- Contributor votes are facilitated by a tool such as Snapshot.
- #[feedback](/notes/aifs/feedback/feedback.md)
	- Contributors are encouraged to provide constructive feedback to each other as they work to help improve the Squad or Circle's ability to execute on its Purpose.
	- SuperBenefit Contributors will be provided with practices they can use in giving or receiving feedback
