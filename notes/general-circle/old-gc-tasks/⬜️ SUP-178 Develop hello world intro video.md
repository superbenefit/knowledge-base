Write brief 
Project Brief: intro to SuperBenefit teaser video
What: A 60-90 second video that's designed to create curiosity and spur further investigation. 
Why: Understanding SuperBenefit requires a fair bit of work. There are documents to read and concepts to absorb. There are diagrams to process and new information to be assessed. It's a big cognitive load.  This video should give viewers a reason to put the effort in to learn more. 
Who: People with some understanding of web3. The role of the video is not to explain the tech or culture of web3. We can assume that the viewer will understand the transformative potential of the space. The viewer will likely be concerned that the spirit of the web3 movement doesn't get lost. They will care about empowering individuals over corporations. They will care about equity and shifting power from the centre to the margins. They will believe in the power of technology to fix historic unbalances. They probably care about making money too, and there is that opportunity as SB issues it's governance token.
The viewer should think: "SuperBenefit sounds cool, tell me more"
The viewer should feel curious and energized.  Like they found something early, like they're getting in before everyone else. They should want to tell a few people about us.
The ToC impact narrative (aka the 1 page pdf with the columns) is a really good starting place to pull the story from. The first three columns on the left pretty much contain the key content. I think the creative job to do is to figure out how to make the script and visuals compelling.  
Here's the video I made in December for an application to an incubator [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXWKpDzIQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHXWKpDzIQ) (that's my daughter narrating). If any of these clips are useful we can reuse them. When we made this we were still in the process of figuring out who we were. I think the tone on this is a little too earnest and not balanced with specifics. This time we have things to be specific about!
