Once confirmed, I'll create a reference page for this.

## Roles hierarchy 

****We don't need to publicly share this but Discord will colour code users etc. based on their highest level Role assigned so it'd be good to lay out how we structure it:
1. Squad Lead
2. Contributor
3. Admin
4. <<Guild Roles>>
5. Member
6. Guest
7. TempAdmin _(This is used if we temporarily need to give a trusted someone admin access for a specific content change that is buried in server settings)_
8. Bot

Admin is lowered in hierarchy so someone's day to day role shows up in colour code/segmentation on the who's online.
