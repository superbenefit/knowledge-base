## Outline of steps for setting up a multi-sig wallet for a SB project
1. Check the proposal that approved the allocation of the funding (snapshot)
	- That it passed
	- How much to allocate 
	- Name of the project
2. Review multi-sig requirements 
	- who is going to be on the multi-sig?
	- what addresses they are going to use? 
	- what is the confirmation threshold?
	- If the project is set up with a founding do this info would all be on in the doc. Example of a prototype founding doc [here](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/ec753aec-320d-413a-9f80-39b9ca9fe064)  
3. Set up polygon in your metamask/wallet connect if you need to ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAv_wpDVLlM) is a link to a video about how to do it with metamask, otherwise ask uncle google how to do this)
4. Watch our video on how to set up the multisig [here](https://www.loom.com/share/6da7ffbc2a4a4fb79893ac36a5189b10)
	- Note this is for setting up a wallet on the polygon network which we will use for most projects because of lower fees
5. Set up the wallet and let the team know via the Multisig-transactions discord channel
