# Enhanced Obsidian Meeting Timeline Plan (COMPLETED ✅)

## The Goal
Create a timeline showing all meetings month-by-month, with links to the original meeting notes and brief summaries of what was discussed.

## Why This Approach Works
- **No manual copying:** Timeline pages use Dataview to automatically find and display meetings
- **Create as needed:** Instead of 40+ empty pages, only create timeline pages when you want to view them
- **One-time setup:** Add dates once, then the system maintains itself
- **Performance optimized:** Minimal Dataview queries for fast loading
- **Handles complex cases:** Including files with multiple meetings in one document

## ✅ CURRENT VAULT STATUS (UPDATED 2025-07-12)
- **Meeting files found**: 365+ files tagged with #meetings
- **Files with dates**: **312 files** ✅ (85% complete!)
- **Date range**: December 2021 to June 2025  
- **Consolidated files**: Not yet split (optional step)
- **Timeline pages created**: 0 (ready to create as needed)

### Folders Processed:
- ✅ `notes/general-circle/old-gc-meetings/` - 138 files updated
- ✅ `notes/dao-primitives/primitives-archive/primitives-meetings/` - 31 files updated 
- ✅ `notes/rpp/rpp-archive/rpp-meetings/core-team-meetings/` - 60 files updated
- ✅ `notes/rpp/rpp-archive/rpp-meetings/os-steward-meetings/` - 48 files updated
- ✅ `notes/rpp/rpp-archive/rpp-meetings/stakeholder-meetings/` - 7 files updated
- ✅ `notes/aifs/aifs-meetings/` - 12 files updated (21 need manual dates)
- ✅ `notes/wp/wp-meetings/` - 20 files updated

### Files Needing Manual Dates (~50 files):
- AIFS meetings with descriptive names (21 files)
- RPP stakeholder meetings with month names (6 files)
- Various meeting files without dates in filenames
- Template files and folder indexes (can be ignored)

## Timeline Location
All timeline files will be created in: `notes/general-circle/timeline/`
- Monthly files: `notes/general-circle/timeline/YYYY-MM.md`
- Yearly files: `notes/general-circle/timeline/YYYY.md` (optional)
- Index file: `notes/general-circle/timeline/timeline.md` (folder note)

## Implementation Progress

### ✅ Step 0: Run Setup Wizard 
**Status:** COMPLETED - System verified ready

### ✅ Step 1: Check Current State
**Status:** COMPLETED - Initial assessment done

### 🎯 Step 2: Split Consolidated Meeting Files (READY TO EXECUTE)
**Status:** READY - Strategy prepared

## Strategy for Splitting Consolidated Meeting Files

### Overview
3 consolidated meeting files containing 70+ meetings need to be split into individual files for timeline integration. Each file has different structures but all will be processed uniformly.

### Files to Process

#### 1. DAO Primitives Weekly Meeting Notes
**File:** `notes/dao-primitives/primitives-archive/primitives-docs/2022-04-19 - Weekly Meeting Notes - DAO Primitives.md`
- **Meeting Count:** ~50 meetings (from 11/15/23 to 4/18/22)
- **Date Format:** Mostly MM/DD/YY format (e.g., `## 11/15/23`)
- **Target Directory:** `notes/dao-primitives/primitives-archive/primitives-meetings/`

#### 2. Reimagining Power (RPP) Meeting Notes
**File:** `notes/rpp/rpp-archive/rpp-docs/old-rpp-docs/2023-08-08 - [TO MOVE] Meeting Notes - RP Planning Workstream.md`
- **Meeting Count:** ~16 meetings (from 11/23/23 to 8/8/23)
- **Date Format:** Mixed formats (`# Date 26/10/23`, `# 16/11/23`)
- **Target Directory:** `notes/rpp/rpp-archive/rpp-meetings/core-team-meetings/`

#### 3. Windfall Project (WP) Meeting Notes
**File:** `notes/wp/wp-meetings/wp-clarity-meeting-notes.md`
- **Meeting Count:** ~10 meetings (from 11/13/23 to 8/4/23)
- **Date Format:** Simple `# MM/DD/YY` format
- **Target Directory:** `notes/wp/wp-meetings/` (same directory)

### Execution Steps

#### Using the multi-meeting-splitter template:
1. Open any note in Obsidian
2. Use CMD/CTRL + P to open command palette
3. Search for "Templater: Insert tools/templates/timeline/multi-meeting-splitter.md"
4. Select file to split from the list
5. Review summary and confirm
6. Check results in target directory

#### Expected Output:
- All dates converted to DD-MM-YYYY format
- Each meeting gets its own file with frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  tags:
    - meetings
  date: DD-MM-YYYY
  source: [[original-file]]
  ```
- Original files preserved for reference

#### Post-Processing:
1. Add notice to top of original files:
   ```markdown
   > ℹ️ **Note:** Individual meeting notes have been extracted to separate files for timeline integration. 
   > See the [[timeline|Meeting Timeline]] for a chronological view.
   > This file is preserved for historical reference.
   ```

2. Verify split worked correctly
3. Test with timeline pages

### Benefits:
- ✅ 70+ meetings added to timeline system
- ✅ All dates standardized to DD-MM-YYYY
- ✅ Each meeting individually linkable
- ✅ No manual copying required
- ✅ Original files preserved

**Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes total

### ✅ Step 3: Add Dates to All Meeting Files
**Status:** COMPLETED - 312 files updated!

The enhanced `batch-date-updater-enhanced` successfully handled:
- Standard formats (YYYY-MM-DD, Week of dates)
- Compressed formats (DDMMYY, MDDYY, etc.)
- Special formats (dots, parentheses, various orderings)
- **85% success rate** across all folders

### 🎯 Step 4: Normalize Meeting Filenames (NEW)
**Status:** NOT STARTED - Optional but recommended

Before creating timeline pages, normalize all meeting filenames to follow a consistent pattern. This ensures clean, readable timeline indexes.

#### Proposed Naming Convention:
```
[Project] Meeting (DD-MM-YYYY).md
```

#### Examples:
- `GC Meeting (15-11-2023).md` (General Circle)
- `DAO Primitives Meeting (15-11-2023).md`
- `RPP Core Team Meeting (23-11-2023).md`
- `AIFS Meeting (08-06-2023).md`
- `WP Meeting (13-11-2023).md`

#### Implementation Options:
1. **Manual Rename** (Safer): Use Obsidian's rename function (F2) - preserves all links
2. **Batch Script** (Faster): Use Templater script to generate rename plan
3. **Folder-by-Folder** (Recommended): Start with smallest folder, test, then proceed

#### Benefits:
- ✅ Consistent appearance in timeline views
- ✅ Easier sorting and navigation
- ✅ Clear project identification
- ✅ Professional appearance

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

### 🎯 Step 5: Create Timeline Pages (READY TO START)
**Status:** NOT STARTED - This is your next step!

**To create your first timeline page:**
1. Navigate to `notes/general-circle/timeline/`
2. Create a new file named `YYYY-MM.md` (example: `2024-06.md`)
3. Insert the `timeline-monthly-simple` template
4. The page automatically populates with that month's meetings

**Suggested starting months** (high meeting activity):
- 2024-06 (June 2024) - Recent activity
- 2023-11 (November 2023) - Peak activity period
- 2022-03 (March 2022) - Historical perspective

### 🎯 Step 6: Create the Timeline Index
**Status:** NOT STARTED - Do this after creating a few timeline pages

1. Create file: `notes/general-circle/timeline/timeline.md`
2. Insert the `timeline-index-improved` template
3. It automatically shows all your timeline pages and statistics

### 📊 Step 7: Analyze Coverage (Optional)
**Status:** AVAILABLE - Run anytime to check completeness

1. Create a temporary note
2. Insert the `coverage-analyzer` template
3. See which months have the most meetings and identify gaps

### 🔧 Step 8: Handle Problem Files
**Status:** IN PROGRESS - ~50 files need manual dates

Most files without dates have descriptive names and need manual review:
- Check file content for meeting dates
- Add to frontmatter: `date: DD-MM-YYYY`
- Or leave without dates if they're templates/ongoing items

## Templates Status

### ✅ Enhanced Templates Used:
- **batch-date-updater-enhanced.md** - Universal date parser (replaced all custom parsers)
- **setup-wizard.md** - Used for initial setup

### 🎯 Ready to Use:
- **timeline-monthly-simple.md** - For creating monthly views
- **timeline-index-improved.md** - For main navigation
- **timeline-year.md** - For annual overviews
- **coverage-analyzer.md** - For gap analysis
- **multi-meeting-splitter.md** - For splitting consolidated files

### 🗑️ Cleaned Up:
- Removed 4 custom date parsers (no longer needed)
- Enhanced batch updater handles all date formats

## Next Steps Summary

1. **Split consolidated meeting files** (15-20 minutes)
   - Run multi-meeting-splitter on the 3 consolidated files
   - Verify results and add notices to original files

2. **Normalize filenames** (1-2 hours) - OPTIONAL
   - Rename files to follow consistent pattern
   - Start with small folder to test
   - Preserves all links automatically

3. **Create your first timeline pages** (5-10 minutes)
   - Pick 3-5 months you're interested in
   - Create YYYY-MM.md files
   - Insert `timeline-monthly-simple` template

4. **Create the timeline index** (2 minutes)
   - Create timeline.md in the timeline folder
   - Insert `timeline-index-improved` template

5. **Optional: Add remaining dates manually** (as needed)
   - Focus on files you actually need
   - Many descriptive files might not need dates

6. **Optional: Run coverage analyzer** (5 minutes)
   - See your meeting patterns over time
   - Identify any gaps in coverage

## Success Achieved! 🎉
- ✅ 312 meeting files now have dates
- ✅ Universal date parser handles all formats
- ✅ System is ready for timeline creation
- ✅ No ongoing maintenance required
- ✅ New meetings will automatically appear in timelines

## What's Different from Original Plan

# Step 4: Normalize Meeting Filenames
### 🎯 Step 4: Normalize Meeting Filenames (IN PROGRESS)
**Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLETE WITH ISSUES - Recovery plan created

**[Full Step 4 Action Plan](step-4-recovery-plan.md)** - Complete guide with visual diagrams

#### Situation Summary
During the first attempt at Step 4, several issues occurred:
- **Parsing errors**: Meeting numbers incorrectly parsed as dates (e.g., "Meeting 5 1112024" → "(51-01-2024)")
- **Lost files**: 12 AIFS files accidentally deleted (now restored from backup)
- **Incomplete normalization**: ~45 files still need work
- **Database findings**: CSV exports revealed dates for all AIFS files

#### Current Status
- ✅ **Already normalized**: ~350 files (GC: 136, RPP Core: 81, most others)
- 🔧 **Need fixes**: ~45 files in partially done folders
- 🆕 **AIFS restored**: 33 files need both date metadata AND normalization

#### Key Issues to Fix

**1. Invalid Dates (4 files)**
- `RPP OS Steward Meeting (51-01-2024).md` → Should be (05-11-2024)
- `RPP OS Steward Meeting (81-00-2024).md` → Should be (08-10-2024)
- `RPP Stakeholder Meeting (14-20-2024).md` → Check frontmatter
- `RPP Stakeholder Meeting (65-20-2024).md` → Check frontmatter

**2. OS Steward Meeting Numbers (~28 files)**
Pattern: `OS Stewards meeting 36 22425.md`
- "36" is the meeting number (not part of date)
- "22425" is the date (22-04-2025)

**3. Other Issues**
- RPP Stakeholder: 4 files with ordinal numbers
- WP: 2 files with legacy names
- DAO Primitives: 3 minor fixes
- AIFS: All 33 files need complete processing

#### Helper Tools Created
- **`comprehensive-issues-check.md`** - Master diagnostic scan
- **`os-steward-parser.md`** - For OS Steward meeting numbers
- **`aifs-processor-complete.md`** - With database dates for all AIFS files
- **`fix-invalid-dates.md`** - For impossible date corrections
- **`status-check.md`** - Progress verification

#### Quick Start
1. Run `comprehensive-issues-check.md` to see current state
2. Fix the 4 invalid dates using frontmatter
3. Process AIFS files with complete date mapping
4. Use OS Steward parser for meeting numbers
5. Complete remaining folders

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours for ~78 files total
