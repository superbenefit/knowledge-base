# Institute for Cosmolocalism

This directory contains materials related to SuperBenefit's collaboration with the Institute for Cosmolocalism (ICS). The ICS focuses on developing and implementing cosmolocal approaches that combine globally shared knowledge with localized production and governance.

## What is Cosmolocalism?

Cosmolocalism is a development approach that follows the principle "what is heavy is local, what is light is global." It combines:

- Globally shared knowledge, designs, and protocols (light)
- Locally implemented production, governance, and resource management (heavy)

This approach enables communities to maintain sovereignty and context-sensitivity while benefiting from global collaboration and shared resources.

## Our Collaboration

SuperBenefit works with the ICS to develop practical implementations of cosmolocal principles, including:

- Design and documentation of local node implementations
- Development of coordination protocols that bridge local and global scales
- Research on effective governance models for cosmolocal systems
- Creation of toolkits and resources for communities adopting cosmolocal approaches

## Contents

This directory contains working documents, research notes, and resources related to our collaborative work with ICS. For finished artifacts that have emerged from this collaboration, see the [artifacts](/artifacts) directory.
