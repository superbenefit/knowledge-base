## History and Background

Founded in 2018, ICS evolved from Reimagine Co, a package-free grocery store and community hub. The organization expanded beyond its origins to become a distinct entity with a broader mission focused on helping Londoners lead more sustainable and connected lives through community-driven initiatives that promote environmental stewardship, circular economies, and social cohesion.

## Vision and Mission

ICS envisions resilient communities where sustainability practices are accessible to all and where local action connects meaningfully to global movements. The organization's mission is to foster community-based sustainability through practical initiatives, knowledge sharing, and innovative governance models that empower local residents while contributing to broader ecological regeneration.

## Core Programs

### Repair Café
A community-based initiative that brings together skilled volunteers and community members to repair household items that would otherwise be discarded. Beyond waste reduction, the Repair Café creates a space for knowledge exchange, skill development, and community building. These events transform the act of repair from an individual chore into a collective, empowering experience.

### Thing Library
A lending library for tools, equipment, and household items that community members can borrow rather than purchase. This resource-sharing model reduces consumption, makes useful items accessible regardless of economic means, and demonstrates practical alternatives to ownership-based consumption. The Thing Library exemplifies how community resources can be managed as commons rather than private property.

### Community Workshops
Educational events covering a range of sustainability topics such as furniture repair, clothing mending, food preservation, and sustainable cooking. These workshops build practical skills while nurturing a culture of self-reliance, resource conservation, and community interdependence.

## Role in the Reimagining Power Project (RPP)

ICS serves as a key implementation partner in the Reimagining Power Project, a two-year initiative exploring how web3 technologies can transform traditional power dynamics in philanthropy and social impact work. Within this collaboration:

- ICS acts as a fiscal sponsor, facilitating the on-ramping of traditional funds into web3 ecosystems
- The organization serves as a real-world testing ground for web3 governance frameworks
- Local programs provide concrete contexts for implementing and evaluating decentralized coordination tools
- Knowledge and insights from implementation are documented and shared through the SuperBenefit Knowledge Garden

## Web3 and ReFi Initiatives

ICS is actively exploring the intersection of local sustainability work and decentralized technologies:

- **DAO Formation**: Implementing decentralized governance models for community programs
- **Impact Verification**: Developing hypercerts and other on-chain mechanisms for documenting outcomes
- **Funding Experiments**: Testing quadratic funding and other participatory resource allocation mechanisms
- **Bridge Building**: Connecting traditional philanthropic institutions with regenerative finance ecosystems

## Connection to Ethereum Localism

ICS embodies principles of Ethereum Localism by:

- Serving as a physical community hub where digital coordination meets place-based implementation
- Implementing cosmolocal approaches ("what is heavy is local, what is light is global")
- Developing as a bioregional node within global decentralized networks
- Creating and sharing open-source documentation of local web3 implementations
- Building connections between on-chain governance and community-scale decision making

The organization's work demonstrates how Ethereum and web3 tools can enhance local resilience while connecting community initiatives to global movements and resources.

## Strategic Direction

ICS aims to evolve from a single local node into a bioregional hub that coordinates multiple stakeholders, mutualizes resources, and enables systemic, place-based solutions. This approach aligns with principles of coordi-nations – voluntary interwoven networks that emphasize mutualism, participatory governance, and sovereignty.
