# ICS Business Description

The Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) is a federal not-for-profit organization that empowers communities to live more sustainably through circular economy initiatives and local resilience programming. We operate several core programs including a Repair Caf√© program that diverts waste from landfills by fixing broken household items, a Thing Library with 500+ items that enables community members to borrow rather than purchase tools and equipment, and educational workshops that build practical skills for sustainable living. Additionally, ICS collaborates with global networks to explore regenerative economic models and decentralized technologies that strengthen community self-reliance while advancing environmental stewardship. Our work focuses on reducing waste, building meaningful community connections, and creating more equitable, sustainable systems for all.
