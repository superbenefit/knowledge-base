# Community Exchange: Harmonization Notes

This document identifies inconsistencies, style variations, and terminology differences across all documents in the Community Exchange project. These notes will guide final edits to ensure a consistent, professional presentation.

## Terminology Consistency

### Core Terms to Standardize

| Term | Standardized Usage | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| Community Exchange | Always capitalized when referring to our specific system | Sometimes appears as "community exchange" (lowercase) |
| Connection Circles | Always capitalized | Sometimes appears as just "circles" |
| Commitment Pool | Always capitalized | Sometimes appears with variations like "commitment pooling" |
| Steward/Stewardship Circle | Always capitalized when referring to the governance body | Sometimes inconsistent capitalization |
| Credit | Lowercase unless beginning a sentence | Used consistently |

### System Parameters

| Parameter | Standard Value | Current Inconsistencies |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Credit Limit | 10 credits (positive or negative) | Some documents mention higher limits |
| Credit Value | 1 credit = 30 minutes or approximately $10 | Consistent across documents |
| Credit Expiration | 3 months of inactivity | Consistent in glossary, but should verify across all docs |

## Document Structure Consistency

### Headings and Hierarchy

- All documents should use a consistent heading hierarchy:
  - # (H1) for document title
  - ## (H2) for major sections
  - ### (H3) for subsections
  - #### (H4) for minor sections

### Formatting Consistency

- Bullet points should use the same format: hyphen (-) instead of asterisk (*)
- Numbered lists should use consistent formatting: 1. followed by a space
- Emphasis should use consistent formatting: either *italics* or **bold** consistently
- Quotes should use consistent formatting: > for blockquotes

## Content Gaps and Inconsistencies

### Future Possibilities and Current Implementation

- The future possibilities document discusses Reimagine Co as an anchor business, which should align with discussions about business participation in other documents.

### Conflict Resolution

- The governance document mentions a separate conflict resolution document, which is now created and should be properly cross-referenced.

### Technology Implementation

- Ensure the three-phase approach to technology implementation (Google Sheets â†’ Sarafu.Network) is consistently described across documents.

## Style Guide for Final Production

### Naming and Capitalization

- "Community Exchange" (capitalized) when referring to our specific system
- "Steward" and "Stewardship Circle" (capitalized) when referring to our governance roles
- "Credit" (lowercase) when referring to our unit of account

### Citations and References

- References to "Grassroots Economics: Reflection and Practice" should be consistent
- References to other works in the appendix should follow a consistent format

### Visual Elements

- Placeholder notes for diagrams and visuals should be consistent
- References to future visual elements should use consistent language
