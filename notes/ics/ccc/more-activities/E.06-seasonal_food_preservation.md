# Seasonal Food Preservation

## Purpose
To share abundance, build food security, pass on traditional skills, and strengthen community bonds through collective food preservation.

## Overview
Seasonal Food Preservation gatherings transform the labor-intensive process of preserving harvest abundance into joyful community events. These sessions allow members to process larger quantities of seasonal produce efficiently while learning valuable preservation skills. By working together to put up food for the future, participants create a tangible reserve of shared abundance while deepening relationships and honoring traditional foodways. These gatherings embody the Community Exchange's values of reciprocity, skill-sharing, and resource stewardship.
