# Skill Development Workshops

To build community capacity, enhance the value of the commitment pool, and increase the range of services available through the Community Exchange.

## Overview
Skill Development Workshops are focused training sessions that go beyond casual skill sharing to develop deeper competency in high-demand areas. By systematically building community capacity in practical skills, these workshops enhance what members can offer to each other, reducing dependency on external services and strengthening local resilience. They combine instruction, hands-on practice, and follow-up support to ensure that learning translates into usable skills that benefit the entire community.
