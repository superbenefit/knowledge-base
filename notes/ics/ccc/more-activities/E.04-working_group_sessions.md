# Working Group Sessions

## Purpose
To advance specific projects or system aspects of the Community Exchange through focused, collaborative effort.

## Overview
Working Groups are task-oriented teams that form around particular needs or opportunities within the Community Exchange. Unlike ongoing operational roles, Working Groups have specific objectives, timeframes, and deliverables. They enable members to contribute their skills to discrete projects that enhance the Exchange system without requiring long-term commitments. Working Groups blend structured productivity with community-building, creating spaces where relationships deepen through shared purpose.

## Types of Working Groups

### System Development Groups
- **Focus**: Improving Exchange infrastructure, policies, or processes
- **Examples**: Credit system refinement, conflict resolution procedures, technology implementation
- **Duration**: Usually 2-3 months with defined milestones

### Special Project Groups
- **Focus**: Creating community resources or implementing new initiatives
- **Examples**: Skill inventory database, tool library, community cookbook
- **Duration**: Varies by project scope, typically 1-6 months

### Event Planning Groups
- **Focus**: Organizing and executing community gatherings
- **Examples**: Quarterly celebrations, skill shares, Jubilee planning
- **Duration**: Typically 4-8 weeks leading up to an event
