# Virtual Connection Circles

## Purpose
To enable participation from those who can't attend in-person events, extend the reach of the Community Exchange, and maintain connections across distance and accessibility barriers.

## Overview
Virtual Connection Circles adapt the core relationship-building and exchange-generating function of in-person Connection Circles to online formats. These gatherings ensure that physical presence is not a requirement for full participation in the Community Exchange, making the system more accessible and inclusive. Through thoughtful digital facilitation, these circles create meaningful connection despite physical distance, allowing homebound members, those with complicated schedules, or geographically distant participants to remain active in the Exchange community. While technology mediates the interaction, the focus remains on human connection and practical resource sharing.
