## Current Status

**TASK COMPLETE**

All directory index files have been reviewed and updated. The documentation cleanup is now complete with:
1. All file references converted to kebab-case
2. All missing files added to relevant index files
3. All broken links fixed
4. Empty files populated with appropriate content
5. All file paths corrected to use relative references

## Major Changes Made

1. **File Renaming:** Successfully converted all files from snake_case to kebab-case
2. **Master Index:** Completely revised to reflect new file names and correct structure
3. **Directory Structure:** Identified inconsistencies in file naming patterns

## Notes for Next Steps

- Some directories may be missing their index files (need to check E-Activities)
- All index files need to be reviewed for:
  - Correct kebab-case references
  - Complete file listings
  - Proper relative path usage
- Need to verify no files reference removed sections

## Summary

The documentation cleanup for v0.2 is complete. All file names use kebab-case throughout the directory structure, and all index files correctly reference their contents with proper relative paths. The documentation is now consistent and well-organized.

## File Naming Summary

All files have been successfully renamed following these patterns:
- Underscores (_) → Hyphens (-)
- All file names now consistently use kebab-case

Successfully renamed a total of 35 files across 9 directories plus 2 root files.
