# Community Exchange: Onboarding Process

This document outlines how new members join the Community Exchange, from invitation through full participation.

## Invitation-Only Membership Model

The Community Exchange uses a closed membership model to ensure trust, alignment with community values, and manageable growth:

- **Initial Members (Q2 2025)**: 20 founding members hand-selected by stewards
- **Growth Phase (Q3 2025+)**: New members must be invited by an existing member
- **Future Expansion**: The community will decide together when and how to potentially open membership further

## Onboarding Journey

### 1. Invitation & Introduction

1. **Personal Invitation**: A potential member receives an invitation from a steward (Phase 1) or existing member (Phase 2+)
2. **Introduction Session**: The invitee attends a 1:1 or small group session to learn about:
   - Core principles and values
   - How the system works
   - Expectations and benefits of membership
   - Questions and concerns

### 2. Orientation

New members attend a 90-minute orientation session covering:

1. **System Overview**:
   - Connection Circles and Commitment Pool explained
   - Credit system and how exchanges work
   - Technology walkthrough (Google Sheets initially)

2. **Community Values Discussion**:
   - Review of core principles
   - Community agreements
   - Conflict resolution process

3. **Resource Mapping**:
   - Guided exercise to identify personal skills, resources, and needs
   - Discussion of potential commitments to offer

### 3. Initial Commitment

Following orientation, each new member:

1. Identifies at least two initial commitments they can offer to the pool
2. Works with a steward to value these commitments appropriately
3. Completes a member profile with contact information and offering details
4. Signs the community agreement

### 4. System Integration

Once the initial commitment is established:

1. The member is added to the system ledger with a starting balance of 0 credits
2. Their commitments are added to the pool and made visible to all members
3. They receive an invitation to the next Connection Circle gathering
4. They're added to the communication channel (group email, Signal, etc.)

### 5. First Exchange

New members are encouraged to:

1. Attend their first Connection Circle within 30 days of joining
2. Complete their first exchange (giving or receiving) within 60 days
3. Meet with a steward after their first exchange for a brief check-in

## Sponsor/Mentor Relationship

Each new member is paired with an experienced member who:

- Checks in regularly during the first 3 months
- Answers questions about using the system
- Helps troubleshoot any challenges
- Introduces them to other members

## Documentation Received

New members receive:

1. Welcome packet with:
   - Community Exchange overview document
   - Core principles and values
   - Glossary of terms
   - Current member directory (with permission)

2. Digital access to:
   - Member handbook (detailed operations guide)
   - Google Sheets ledger (view access)
   - Communication channels

## Ongoing Integration

Beyond initial onboarding:

- Monthly "New Member Integration" sessions during the first quarter
- Regular Connection Circles for relationship-building
- Seasonal community celebrations to strengthen ties
- Annual renewal conversation

## Offboarding Process

If a member chooses to leave:

1. They notify a steward of their intention to depart
2. They work to balance their credit account (aim for 0 credits)
3. They complete any outstanding commitments or find replacements
4. Their member status becomes "inactive" but their contribution history is preserved
5. They're invited to a brief exit conversation to share feedback

*This onboarding process may evolve based on community feedback and experience. The stewardship circle will review and update it quarterly during the pilot phase.*
