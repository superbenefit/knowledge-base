# How to Propose a Community Activity

The Community Exchange thrives on member-initiated activities that build relationships, share skills, and strengthen our local economy. This guide walks you through the process of proposing and implementing a new community activity.

## Why Propose an Activity?

Community-led activities are vital to our exchange system because they:
- Address specific interests or needs within the community
- Leverage the unique talents and passions of members
- Create opportunities for multiple exchanges to happen simultaneously
- Build community cohesion and shared identity
- Revitalize the system with fresh energy and ideas

## Types of Activities You Might Propose

Consider proposing activities that align with the Community Exchange values and goals:

- **Skill-building workshops** (cooking, crafting, home repair, etc.)
- **Resource-sharing events** (seed swaps, tool libraries, clothing exchanges)
- **Collective labor opportunities** (garden builds, home renovations, harvesting days)
- **Cultural celebrations** that build community bonds
- **Learning circles** for exploring topics of shared interest
- **Service projects** that benefit the broader community
- **Creative collaborations** that produce shared value

## Step 1: Develop Your Idea

Before formally proposing your activity, take time to develop your concept:

### Initial Concept Development
- Define the **purpose** of the activity
- Consider the **format** that would work best (workshop, gathering, work day, etc.)
- Think about **timing** and **frequency** (one-time event or recurring?)
- Identify necessary **resources** and possible **venues**
- Consider how it specifically **supports the Community Exchange**
- Reflect on how it aligns with our **community values**

### Preliminary Research
- Has something similar been done before? Learn from past experiences
- Are there members with relevant skills or interests?
- What resources already exist in the community?
- Is there a natural time of year or community rhythm for this activity?

## Step 2: Create a Proposal

Prepare a simple proposal that includes:

### Essential Components
1. **Activity Name and Description**
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Concise explanation of the activity and its purpose
   - Expected benefits to participants and the community

2. **Practical Details**
   - Proposed date/time/location
   - Duration and format
   - Maximum/minimum number of participants
   - Accessibility considerations

3. **Resource Needs**
   - Space requirements
   - Materials or equipment needed
   - Skills or help required from others
   - Estimated costs (if any)

4. **Credit Implications**
   - How will credits be used in this activity?
   - Will facilitators or organizers earn credits?
   - Will participants earn or spend credits?
   - How does this strengthen the credit system?

5. **Implementation Plan**
   - Key tasks and timeline
   - Roles needed
   - How you'll promote the activity
   - How you'll evaluate success

## Step 3: Submit to Stewards

### Submission Process
- Email your proposal to the steward circle using the subject line "Activity Proposal: [Name of Activity]"
- Be clear about your timeline and any support you're requesting
- Include your contact information for follow-up questions

### Steward Review
The stewards will review your proposal considering:
- Alignment with community values and goals
- Resource availability and practicality
- Credit system implications
- Balance with other community activities
- Community interest and need

### Feedback and Refinement
- Be open to questions or suggestions from the stewards
- The stewards may suggest modifications or connections to similar initiatives
- Work collaboratively to refine the proposal if needed

## Step 4: Planning and Implementation

Once your proposal is approved:

### Detailed Planning
- Develop a detailed activity plan and timeline
- Confirm venue and resources
- Recruit additional help if needed
- Create any necessary materials or instructions

### Promotion
- Work with stewards to announce the activity in community channels
- Create a clear description for the newsletter or online calendar
- Consider personal outreach to members who might be especially interested
- Be clear about registration process if applicable

### Preparation
- Send reminders to registered participants
- Prepare the space and materials
- Consider creating a simple agenda or flow for the activity
- Have a plan for tracking participation and gathering feedback

### The Activity Itself
- Arrive early to set up
- Welcome participants and create an inclusive atmosphere
- Document the activity with photos (with permission) or notes
- Facilitate any credit exchanges related to the activity
- Thank participants and communicate next steps

## Step 5: Evaluation and Documentation

After the activity:

### Gather Feedback
- Ask participants what worked well and what could improve
- Reflect on your own experience as facilitator
- Consider what you would do differently next time

### Document the Experience
- Write a brief summary of the activity
- Note attendance and engagement
- Track any exchanges or commitments that resulted
- Share photos or stories (with permission)

### Share Learnings
- Provide a summary to the stewards
- Share insights with the broader community
- Offer your documentation to help others who might lead similar activities
- Consider writing up a "How-To Guide" for the activity if it was successful

### Future Planning
- Decide if this should become a recurring activity
- Identify any changes for next time
- Consider mentoring others to lead similar activities
- Update your proposal based on the actual experience

## Credit Considerations

Activities can interact with the credit system in various ways:

### Examples of Credit Integration
- **Workshop facilitation:** Facilitator earns credits from participants who attend
- **Work days:** Host provides credits to those who contribute labor
- **Skill shares:** Teachers earn credits, learners pay credits
- **Community celebrations:** Organizers earn credits from the community pool
- **Resource exchanges:** Credits flow based on value of items exchanged

### Talk with stewards about:
- Appropriate credit valuation for your activity
- How to record exchanges that happen during the activity
- Whether any credits should come from the community pool
- How to handle credit exchanges for multiple participants

## Tips for Success

- **Start small** and build from success
- **Connect** with others who have similar interests or complementary skills
- **Document** as you go to make future activities easier
- **Be flexible** and responsive to community needs
- **Celebrate** successes and learn from challenges
- **Invite** others to take leadership roles to avoid burnout
