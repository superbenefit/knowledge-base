# How to Use the Technology Tools

The Community Exchange uses technology tools to help track commitments, record exchanges, and manage credits. This guide explains both the initial Google Sheets system (Phase 1) and the more advanced Sarafu.Network system (Phase 2).

## Phase 1: Google Sheets System

The initial technology implementation uses shared Google Sheets to track community exchange activity. This approach offers simplicity, familiarity, and minimal technical barriers for most participants.

### Accessing the Sheets

1. **Initial Access**
   - After your orientation, you'll receive an email with links to the shared Google Sheets folder
   - The folder contains several spreadsheets: Commitment Catalog, Transaction Ledger, and Credit Balances
   - Bookmark these links for easy access
   - You'll have view access to all sheets and edit access to specific forms

2. **Technical Requirements**
   - A Google account (create one for free if needed)
   - Internet access
   - Any device that can view Google Sheets (computer, tablet, smartphone)
   - For those without internet access, printed copies can be requested and paper forms submitted

3. **Access Support**
   - If you have difficulty accessing the sheets, contact a steward
   - Support is available during Connection Circles
   - Phone support options are available for those less comfortable with technology

### Viewing Available Commitments

1. **Opening the Commitment Catalog**
   - Click the link to the Commitment Catalog sheet
   - The sheet opens in your browser, showing all current commitments
   - Each row represents one commitment offered by a community member

2. **Finding What You Need**
   - Use the filter buttons (top row) to sort by category, provider, or credit value
   - Use the search box (Ctrl+F or Command+F) to find specific items
   - Look at the "Available" column to ensure the commitment is currently active

3. **Understanding the Information**
   - **Provider:** Who is offering this commitment
   - **Description:** Detailed explanation of what is offered
   - **Category:** Type of service or good (e.g., Food, Skills, Transportation)
   - **Credit Value:** Number of credits required
   - **Limitations:** Any restrictions on time, location, or quantity
   - **Contact Method:** How to reach the provider
   - **Status:** Whether the commitment is currently available

### Reporting Completed Exchanges

After you've completed an exchange, you need to report it so credits can be transferred:

1. **Option 1: Email Reporting**
   - Send an email to the designated steward address
   - Include: Provider name, Receiver name, Commitment description, Date, Credit amount
   - Subject line: "Exchange Completed"
   - The steward will confirm receipt and update the ledger

2. **Option 2: Exchange Reporting Form**
   - Open the Exchange Reporting Form (link in the shared folder)
   - Fill in all required fields
   - Submit the form
   - A steward will process the exchange within 48 hours

3. **Option 3: In-Person Reporting**
   - Report exchanges at Connection Circles
   - Complete a paper form if needed
   - Provide all relevant details to the steward

4. **Confirmation Process**
   - Both parties should confirm the exchange
   - In case of discrepancies, a steward will follow up
   - Once confirmed, credits will be transferred and balances updated

### Checking Your Balance

1. **Opening the Credit Balances Sheet**
   - Click the link to the Credit Balances sheet
   - The sheet opens in your browser
   - Members are listed alphabetically by last name

2. **Finding Your Information**
   - Locate your name in the first column
   - Review your current balance in the "Current Balance" column
   - View your transaction history in the subsequent columns:
     - Credits earned (incoming)
     - Credits spent (outgoing)
     - Running balance

3. **Understanding Credit History**
   - Each transaction is listed with date, description, and amount
   - Positive numbers represent credits earned
   - Negative numbers represent credits spent
   - Your current balance is the sum of all transactions

4. **Balance Updates**
   - Balances are updated by stewards
   - Updates typically occur within 48 hours of reported exchanges
   - The "Last Updated" timestamp shows when the sheet was last modified

### Submitting New Commitments

1. **Option 1: Email Submission**
   - Send an email to the designated steward address
   - Include all commitment details (description, value, limitations, etc.)
   - Subject line: "New Commitment"
   - A steward will follow up if more information is needed

2. **Option 2: Commitment Form**
   - Open the New Commitment Form (link in the shared folder)
   - Fill in all required fields
   - Submit the form
   - A steward will review and add your commitment to the catalog

3. **Option 3: In-Person Submission**
   - Bring your commitment details to a Connection Circle
   - Discuss with a steward who will help refine and value it
   - Complete a paper form if needed
