# Steward Circle Meetings

## Purpose
To maintain system health, address challenges, make governance decisions, and plan community activities for the Community Exchange.

## Overview
The Steward Circle is the caretaking body of the Community Exchange, responsible for the operational wellbeing of the system. Through regular meetings, stewards monitor exchange patterns, resolve conflicts, plan community events, and ensure the system remains aligned with its core values and principles. These meetings blend practical management with visionary leadership to keep the Exchange vibrant and responsive to community needs.

## Types of Meetings

### Monthly Strategic Sessions
- **Duration**: 2 hours
- **Focus**: System health review, policy discussions, long-term planning
- **Format**: In-depth discussions, decision-making, and strategic planning
- **Documentation**: Detailed minutes shared with the community
