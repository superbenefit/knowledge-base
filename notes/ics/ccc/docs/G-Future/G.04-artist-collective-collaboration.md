# Artist Collective Collaboration

## Overview

Local artist collectives Corduroy and Xuux demonstrate how Community Exchange can support creative communities while potentially creating new market access opportunities. This model explores both internal trading networks and external customer acquisition strategies.

## Potential Applications
