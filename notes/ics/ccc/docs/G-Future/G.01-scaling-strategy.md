## Scaling Principles

Our growth strategy is guided by these core principles:

1. **Relationship-Based Growth**: Expanding through existing relationships rather than mass recruitment
2. **Maintain Quality**: Preserving the high-trust environment as we grow
3. **Nested Circles**: Creating new circles rather than indefinitely expanding a single group
4. **Infrastructure Before Growth**: Ensuring our systems can support each expansion phase
5. **Evolutionary Approach**: Learning and adapting as we grow

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Q2-Q3 2025)

### Focus: Quality Over Quantity
- Start with 20 hand-selected founding members
- Build strong relationships and trust through regular Connection Circles
- Establish core processes and systems
- Develop governance structures and documentation

### Key Activities
- Regular Connection Circles to strengthen relationships
- Careful documentation of exchanges and learnings
- Development of onboarding materials and processes
- Training of initial stewards

### Success Metrics
- 80% of founding members actively participating
- At least 30 total exchanges completed
- Core documentation and systems in place
- Positive member feedback on initial experience

## Phase 2: Controlled Expansion (Q4 2025-Q1 2026)

### Focus: Testing Growth Mechanisms
- Allow founding members to invite new participants
- Refine onboarding processes based on experience
- Begin technology transition to more scalable platform
- Develop member advancement pathway

### Invitation Process
1. Existing members identify potential new members
2. Initial conversation to gauge interest and alignment
3. Formal invitation through stewards
4. Structured onboarding with sponsor support
5. First exchange facilitation

### Success Metrics
- Growth to 35-40 members by end of Q4 2025
- 50-60 members by end of Q1 2026
- 75% retention rate of new members
- 80% of new members complete first exchange within 30 days

## Phase 3: Nested Growth (Q1-Q4 2026)

### Focus: Creating New Circles
- Support formation of new circles based on geography or interest
- Establish inter-circle exchange protocols
- Develop circle steward training program
- Create shared resources and autonomy balance

### Circle Formation Models
1. **Geographic Circles**:
   - Neighbourhood-based groups
   - Local exchanges for frequent, proximity-based needs
   - Inter-circle exchanges for specialized needs

2. **Interest-Based Circles**:
   - Groups formed around shared interests or needs
   - Examples: food production, childcare, home repair
   - Specialized exchange density within circles

3. **Organizational Circles**:
   - Based in existing organizations (cooperatives, non-profits)
   - Leveraging established relationships
   - Bridging organizational resources with community needs

### Inter-Circle Connections
- **Bridge Members**: Participants in multiple circles who facilitate connections
- **Credit Clearing**: Systems for exchanges across circle boundaries
  - Direct credit exchange between pools when possible
  - MAPLE stablecoin as bridge currency for complex exchanges
  - Automated settlement via Citizen Wallet infrastructure
- **Joint Events**: Regular gatherings bringing multiple circles together
  - Journeyland-style community gatherings for inter-circle connection
  - Artist collective events as cross-circle touchpoints
  - Quarterly inter-circle markets and exchanges
- **Resource Sharing**: Shared tools, documentation, and practices
  - Reimagine meal credits system as cross-circle utility
  - Impact Yield Fund as shared funding mechanism
  - Coordinated support during emergencies or high-demand periods

### Success Metrics
- At least 3 distinct circles operating by end of 2026
- 100+ total members across all circles

- All roles remain volunteer-based
- Focus on gift economy principles
- Recognition through community status and credits

#### Phase 2: Hybrid Model (2026)
- Key stewardship roles begin receiving partial compensation
- ICS Credit Backing Model (G.08) provides cash stability
- Compensation starts at 10-20% of equivalent market rate
  - Allows volunteers to continue while receiving modest support
  - Prevents over-reliance on compensation
  - Maintains gift economy spirit

#### Phase 3: Structured Compensation (2027+)
- Full compensation pathways for critical roles
- Tiered compensation based on responsibility and time commitment
- Funded through:
  - Impact Yield Fund distributions
  - MAPLE yield generation
  - Partner organization contributions
  - Member voluntary cash contributions

### Cash Integration Pathways

1. **Anchor Business Support**
   - Partner businesses maintain cash reserves for their vouchers
   - Businesses can partially back credits with cash
   - Cash payments accepted for certain specialized services

2. **ICS Backing Model**
   - ICS provides partial cash backing for system stability
   - Focus on essential services during economic downturns
   - Buffer mechanism for transitional periods

3. **MAPLE Stablecoin Bridge**
   - Provides gateway between credit system and CAD economy
   - Allows optional cash redemption for participating businesses
   - Generates yield for community fund

4. **Tiered Cash Integration**
   - Level 1: Credits-only for basic services
   - Level 2: Hybrid credit/cash for specialized services

   - Neighborhood Connection Circle to gauge interest
   - Resource mapping specific to the neighborhood
   - Identification of local needs and offerings
   - Assessment of potential membership

3. **Formation**
   - Formal agreement to form a circle
   - Steward training and mentorship
   - Setup of circle-specific systems
   - Initial member onboarding

4. **Launch**
   - Kickoff celebration
   - First round of exchanges
   - Regular neighborhood gatherings
   - Inter-circle connection establishment

5. **Growth and Autonomy**
   - Gradual expansion through local relationships
   - Development of neighborhood-specific practices
   - Regular coordination with other circles
   - Eventual formation of satellite circles as needed

## Invitation System for Sustainable Growth

Rather than unlimited growth, we use a staged invitation system:

### Stage 1: Founding Invitation (Q2-Q3 2025)
- Stewards directly invite founding members
- Focused on diversity of skills, resources, and perspectives
- High-touch onboarding and relationship building

### Stage 2: Member Invitation (Q4 2025-Q1 2026)
- Each founding member can invite up to 2 new members
- New members must participate for 3 months before gaining invitation privileges
- Focus on relationship quality and system capacity

### Stage 3: Circle Formation (Q2-Q4 2026)
- Members can form new circles with 5+ interested people
- New circles develop their own invitation protocols
- Original circle provides mentorship and support

### Stage 4: Open Pathways (2027+)
- Multiple entry points to the network
- Clear processes for both individual and group participation
- Balance between openness and maintaining quality

## Learning and Adaptation

Our scaling strategy is not fixed but evolving based on:

- **Regular Evaluation**: Quarterly review of growth metrics and quality indicators
- **Member Feedback**: Ongoing collection of experiences and suggestions
- **Cross-Pollination**: Learning from other community exchange systems
- **Emergent Patterns**: Noticing and supporting organic developments

We'll formally review and update this scaling strategy:
- After the first invitation round (Q1 2026)
- As the first new circle forms
- Annually thereafter
