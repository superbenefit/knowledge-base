# How It Works: The Three Pathways

The Community Connection & Commitment Commons (C4) operates through three complementary systems, each with its own pathway for participation. Members can engage with any or all, depending on their interests, needs, and capacity.

## Belonging Commons

The Belonging Commons serves as the universal entry point where everyone is welcome:

1. **Join Community Gatherings**: Attend soup gatherings or similar welcoming events
2. **Explore**: Learn about the broader C4 system in a low-pressure environment
3. **Connect**: Meet community members in an open, inclusive space
4. **Decide**: Choose whether to engage more deeply with other components

## Connection Commons

The Connection Commons creates ongoing relationships around skills, interests, and learning. Here's how to participate:

1. **Join the Community**: Attend an orientation session to learn about the Connection Commons program
2. **Profile Creation**: Share your interests, skills you can teach, and things you want to learn
3. **Attend Monthly Gatherings**: Participate in facilitated sessions where connections are made based on shared interests
4. **Ongoing Matching**: Between gatherings, facilitators continue connecting people with complementary interests
5. **Skill Sharing & Learning**: Meet one-on-one or in small groups to share knowledge and skills
6. **Relationship Building**: Develop deeper community connections through meaningful exchanges
7. **Community Cultivation**: Help shape the evolution of the program through feedback and participation

> **Like a forest and its mycorrhizal network.** What we see above ground—the trees, shrubs, and plants—is similar to our Connection Commons where community members visibly interact and share. Underground, an intricate network of fungal connections helps trees share nutrients and information—much like our Commitment Commons that quietly facilitates resource exchange. Just as the forest's resilience depends on both what's visible and invisible, our community thrives through both public connections and structured exchanges.

## Commitment Commons

The Commitment Commons facilitates tangible exchanges of goods and services through a credit system. Here's how it works:

1. **Orientation**: Learn about the credit system and how to participate
2. **Resource Offering**: Register specific goods or services you can provide to the community
3. **Record Keeping**: Your commitments are formalized in the community ledger
4. **Fulfilling Commitments**: Provide your offered services or goods to other members
5. **Earning Credits**: Receive credits in the ledger for contributions you make
6. **Redeeming Credits**: Use accumulated credits to receive services or goods from other members
7. **Periodic Review**: Participate in regular assessment of the pool's health and balance

### Pool Seeding

For this pilot phase, the Commitment Commons will be seeded entirely through member commitments - no cash or external funding required. Each pilot participant will contribute their own commitments upon joining, creating the initial pool of available resources. This commitment-only approach allows us to test the core mechanics of community exchange while keeping the system simple and focused.

As the system evolves, future versions may explore different seeding approaches (see G-Future section for potential cash integration pathways).

### Credit System

The Commitment Commons operates on a simple credit system:

- **1 Credit = 30 minutes of work OR $10 value** of goods/services (as a general rule)
  - *Note: For this pilot phase, we're using a fixed $10 value to simplify tracking and understanding. Future versions may incorporate dynamic valuation such as percentage of minimum wage or inflation-adjusted values.*
  - *This is only a general rule; certain goods and services may be valued differently and the valuation protocol is an important part of the Commitment Commmons*
- Credits are created through mutual agreement between members
- Members can earn unlimited credits by fulfilling commitments
- Credits can be spent on any available goods or services in the pool
- **Credit Limits**:
  - **Issuance limit**: Maximum negative balance of -10 credits (primary constraint)
  - Prevents over-promising services you can't deliver
  - **Holding limit**: Maximum positive balance of 10 credits (optional, secondary)
  - Note: In mutual credit systems, holding (hoarding) is often beneficial as it provides system stability
- As the community grows, pools may connect with other regenerative economies, although each connection remains optional and values-driven. Different pools may choose different paths: some might accept various regenerative currencies, others might connect only within the commitment pool network, while others remain focused purely on local exchanges.

### The Four Core Protocols

Following the framework documented in Ruddick's Grassroots Economics book, our Commitment Commons is built on four essential protocols that enable effective resource coordination. These protocols are found in natural ecosystems and ancient human societies alike:

1. **Curation**: The process of selecting and organizing which commitments are included in our community pool. In our system, this happens through the resource offering registration process, where members specify what goods or services they can provide. Stewards help ensure these offerings align with community values and needs.

2. **Valuation**: Establishing the relative value of different commitments within the pool. Our system uses a straightforward approach as a starting point: 1 credit = 30 minutes of work OR $10 value of goods/services. This creates a common unit of account that allows diverse contributions to be fairly exchanged.

3. **Limitation**: Setting maximum quantities or boundaries on commitments to prevent imbalances. Our system implements this through issuance limits (maximum negative balance of -10 credits) to ensure system stability and prevent overcommitment.

4. **Exchange**: The protocols that govern how, when, and under what conditions commitments can be exchanged. Our system allows members to exchange directly with each other according to mutually agreed terms, with transactions recorded in the community ledger.

These four protocols work together to create a balanced, resilient system where commitments flow efficiently through the community, matching needs with resources in a way that builds mutual support and reduces dependency on scarce money.

## Examples of Typical Exchanges

### In the Belonging Commons:
- **First Encounters**: Newcomers share soup and stories with long-time community members, learning about C4 without pressure to join
- **Resource Sharing**: Community members bring food to share in a potluck-style gathering that welcomes everyone regardless of their ability to contribute
- **Community Support**: A newcomer expresses a need for winter clothing, and existing members help connect them with resources

### In the Connection Commons:

- **Skill Sharing**: Marina teaches Sanjay how to make sourdough bread over three sessions, while he later helps her learn basic carpentry.
- **Interest Groups**: Five members who share an interest in permaculture form a study group that meets monthly in different gardens.
- **Knowledge Exchange**: A retired professor offers informal history discussions in exchange for smartphone tutorials from younger members.
- **Collaborative Projects**: Three members with complementary skills (design, carpentry, and coordination) collaborate to create a community noticeboard.

### In the Commitment Commons:

- **Goods Exchange**: Juan offers homemade jams valued at 5 credits each; he uses those credits to receive childcare from Aisha.
- **Service Swap**: Priya offers 3 hours of graphic design (15 credits); she later uses these credits for bicycle repairs from Karim.
- **Mixed Exchange**: David repairs Lee's laptop (10 credits) and uses those credits toward fresh vegetables from various members' gardens.
- **Group Coordination**: Five members use their collective credits to arrange a community space cleanup, with each contributor receiving an equal share of credits.

## Joining Multiple Pathways

Many members find value in participating in all components:

- The Belonging Commons offers a low-pressure introduction to the community
- A connection made in the Connection Commons might evolve into a formalized exchange through the Commitment Commons
- Trust built through successful Commitment Commons exchanges often leads to deeper relationships in the Connection Commons
- Skills discovered in one pathway can be offered in another
- The full richness of C4 emerges when relationship-building and structured exchange work in harmony

## A Note on Taxation

**DISCLAIMER**: This information is not legal or tax advice. We provide a friendly overview for awareness, but each member should consult with a qualified accounting professional for specific guidance.

### Understanding the Landscape

Community Connection & Commitment Commons operates in a unique space where traditional tax frameworks may not directly apply. Here's what to consider:

- We exchange commitments (vouchers/credits) rather than directly trading goods or services
- This creates a "promise economy" that may differ from traditional barter systems
- Similar community exchange systems in Canada (like LETS systems and timebanks) have successfully operated within legal frameworks for decades
- The system's transparent nature means all transactions are open and observable

### Your Individual Responsibility

While the system operates openly and transparently:
- Each member is ultimately responsible for determining their own tax obligations to the CRA
- We encourage consultation with accounting professionals familiar with mutual credit systems
- If you have questions about reporting requirements, please seek professional advice

### Community Exchange Examples

For reference, other Canadian communities using similar systems have found them to be:
- Aligned with community support principles
- Operating within the spirit of mutual aid
- Contributing to local resilience and connection

We're proud to join this tradition of community-driven economic innovation while encouraging responsible participation.

## Federated Architecture

Community Connection & Commitment Commons operates as a federated network of autonomous pools:
- Each pool maintains sovereignty while choosing federation partners
- Exchange relationships are flexible: open, selective, closed, or partially open
- Diverse pool types: geographic, sector/industry, interest/values-based

### Diverse Pool Ecosystem
- Geographic pools: neighborhoods, districts
- Sector pools: artists, tech workers, food systems
- Interest pools: zero-waste, mutual aid, time banking
- Special purpose pools: childcare co-ops, tool libraries

## Getting Started

The Community Connection & Commitment Commons is launching with a small pilot group in Q2 2025. If you've received this document, you're invited to be part of this initial community. Together, we'll build a more resilient, connected, and abundant local economy.
