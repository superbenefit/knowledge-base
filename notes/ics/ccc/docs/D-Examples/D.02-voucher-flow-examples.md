# Community Connection & Commitment Commons: Voucher Flow Examples

This document provides concrete examples of how Commitment Vouchers flow through the Community Connection & Commitment Commons system. These scenarios illustrate different patterns of exchange and show how members might use the system in practice.

## Example 1: The Simple Exchange

**Scenario**: Sarah needs help with garden cleanup, and Miguel wants to offer his gardening skills to the community.

**Voucher Flow**:
1. Miguel adds "Garden help - 2 Vouchers per hour" to the Commitment Commons
2. Sarah sees Miguel's offering and contacts him through the system
3. They arrange for Miguel to help with Sarah's garden for 2 hours
4. After completing the work, they record the exchange
5. Miguel earns 4 Vouchers, and Sarah's balance decreases by 4 Vouchers
6. Miguel now has 4 Vouchers to use elsewhere in the system

**Key Learning**: This simple one-to-one exchange shows the basic mechanics of the system, with one member providing a service and earning Vouchers that can be used later.

## Example 2: The Skill Share Circuit

**Scenario**: Three members with different skills help each other in a circuit.

**Credit Flow**:
1. Jennifer teaches David programming skills for 1 hour (2 Vouchers)
2. David repairs Amira's bicycle (2 Vouchers)
3. Amira cooks a special meal for Jennifer (2 Vouchers)

**Result**:
- Jennifer: -2 Vouchers (received meal) +2 Vouchers (taught programming) = 0 net
- David: -2 Vouchers (repaired bike) +2 Vouchers (learned programming) = 0 net
- Amira: -2 Vouchers (cooked meal) +2 Vouchers (got bike repaired) = 0 net

**Key Learning**: Vouchers can flow in a circle, with each person both giving and receiving. When this happens, everyone's needs are met and Voucher balances can return to zero, demonstrating perfect circulation.

## Example 3: Balancing Over Time

**Scenario**: Robert, a new member, needs several services before he's able to contribute back.

**Credit Flow**:
1. Robert joins the C4 with 0 Vouchers
2. He receives help moving furniture from Elena (3 Vouchers)
3. He gets computer troubleshooting from Oliver (2 Vouchers)
4. Robert's balance is now -5 Vouchers
5. Over the next month, Robert offers his graphic design skills:
   - Creating a flyer for a community event (2 Vouchers)
   - Designing a logo for Danielle's small business (3 Vouchers)
6. Robert's balance returns to 0

**Key Learning**: The system allows for temporary imbalances, giving members flexibility to receive help when needed and contribute when able, as long as they work toward balance over time.

## Example 4: Care Network Support

**Scenario**: A member with temporary needs receives support from multiple community members.

**Credit Flow**:
1. Elena breaks her leg and needs short-term support
2. She posts her needs to the Community Connection & Commitment Commons
3. Several members step in to help:
   - Marcus delivers groceries (2 Vouchers)
   - Nadia walks her dog three times (3 Vouchers)
   - Pablo drives her to two medical appointments (4 Vouchers)
4. Elena's balance decreases by 9 Vouchers
5. Once recovered, Elena teaches Spanish lessons to four community members over several months, earning back the Vouchers (and more)

**Key Learning**: The C4 can function as a care network during times of need, allowing members to receive intensive support and contribute back when they're able.

## Example 5: Goods and Skills Combination

**Scenario**: Members exchange both physical items and services.

**Credit Flow**:
1. Fatima offers homemade sourdough bread (2 Vouchers per loaf)
2. Thomas receives a loaf (-2 Vouchers) and later offers basic plumbing help
3. Yasmin needs help fixing a leaky faucet and engages Thomas (-3 Vouchers to Yasmin, +3 to Thomas)
4. Yasmin offers handmade candles (set of 3 for 2 Vouchers)
5. Fatima purchases the candles (-2 Vouchers to Fatima, +2 to Yasmin)

**Result**:
- Fatima: +2 Vouchers (bread) -2 Vouchers (candles) = 0 net
- Thomas: -2 Vouchers (bread) +3 Vouchers (plumbing) = +1 net
- Yasmin: -3 Vouchers (plumbing) +2 Vouchers (candles) = -1 net

**Key Learning**: The system accommodates both goods and services, allowing diverse forms of exchange.

## Example 6: Multi-Session Skill Exchange

**Scenario**: Long-term skill sharing arrangement between members.

**Credit Flow**:
1. Jordan wants to learn guitar and posts this need to the Exchange
2. Aria, an experienced guitarist, offers lessons (3 Vouchers per hour)
3. They arrange for weekly 1-hour lessons
4. After each lesson, 3 Vouchers are transferred from Jordan to Aria
5. Over 8 lessons, Jordan transfers 24 Vouchers to Aria
6. Jordan offers professional tax preparation to several members, earning Vouchers to pay for the lessons

**Key Learning**: The C4 can support ongoing learning relationships and larger Voucher transfers over time, with members finding ways to earn Vouchers through their unique skills.

## Example 7: Membership and Access Exchange

**Scenario**: A member offers specialized equipment access in exchange for credits.

**Credit Flow**:
1. Chen has a professional sewing machine and offers access (2 Vouchers per day)
2. Various members use the sewing machine over time:
   - Malik: 1 day (2 Vouchers)
   - Devi: 2 days (4 Vouchers)
   - Leo: 1.5 days (3 Vouchers)
1. Chen accumulates 9 Vouchers
2. Chen uses these Vouchers for various community offerings:
   - Homemade meals when he's busy with work (4 Vouchers)
   - Help setting up a new computer (3 Vouchers)
   - Garden consultation (2 Vouchers)

**Key Learning**: The C4 allows members to monetize access to equipment or space they already own, turning unused capacity into Vouchers that meet other needs.

## Example 8: Business Integration

**Scenario**: A small local business participates in the Exchange.

**Credit Flow**:
1. Reimagine Co offers 10 meal certificates to the pool (1 Voucher per meal)
2. Various members redeem these meal certificates with their earned Vouchers:
   - Aisha uses 2 Vouchers for 2 meals
   - Kai uses 3 Vouchers for 3 meals
   - Various other members use the remaining 5 meal certificates
3. Reimagine accumulates 10 Vouchers
4. Reimagine uses these Vouchers for:
   - Graphic design for a new menu (3 Vouchers)
   - Help with a special event (4 Vouchers)
   - Translation services for multilingual materials (3 Vouchers)

**Key Learning**: Local businesses can participate in the C4, offering their products or services and receiving valuable support in return, creating a more resilient local economy.
