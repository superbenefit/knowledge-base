# Impact Yield Fund Structure Options

This document outlines various on-chain structural approaches for implementing the Impact Yield Fund, focusing on options that can be deployed quickly, affordably, and with maximum on-chain integration.

## 1. DAO Treasury with Yield Allocation

### Overview
- Simple DAO structure that manages treasury assets directly on-chain
- Treasury invests in established yield protocols (Aave, Compound, etc.)
- Yield automatically split between investors and impact initiatives through smart contracts
- Governance rights potentially represented through non-transferable tokens

### Implementation
- Use existing DAO frameworks (Aragon, DAOhaus, Colony) for quick setup
- Smart contracts handle yield splitting based on predetermined ratios
- Multisig for initial governance, with path to token-based voting
- Transparent on-chain tracking of all fund movements and allocations

### Timeline & Cost
- **Setup Timeline**: 1-2 months
- **Estimated Cost**: $10,000-20,000 (primarily for smart contract development/audits)
- **Operational Requirements**: Community management, yield strategy optimization

### Advantages
- **Speed to Launch**: Can be operational within weeks using existing frameworks
- **Governance Flexibility**: Can start centralized and progressively decentralize
- **Transparency**: All fund flows visible on-chain
- **Scalability**: Structure can handle growth from pilot to significant AUM

### Considerations
- **Regulatory Clarity**: May need careful structuring to avoid security classification
- **Technical Dependencies**: Reliance on DAO framework security and maintenance
- **Investor Familiarity**: Less familiar structure for traditional investors

## 2. Protocol-Owned Liquidity Model

### Overview
- Inspired by Olympus DAO but purpose-built for impact
- Protocol itself owns the liquidity/capital base
- Investors receive tokens representing claim on principal
- Yield automatically directed to impact treasury through smart contract mechanisms

### Implementation
- Create bonding mechanism for capital contributions
- Establish automated yield direction protocols
- Community governance over impact allocation
- On-chain impact tracking and attestation

### Timeline & Cost
- **Setup Timeline**: 2-3 months
- **Estimated Cost**: $15,000-30,000
- **Operational Requirements**: Active protocol management, regular parameter adjustment

### Advantages
- **Capital Efficiency**: Protocol ownership of assets creates potential for higher yields
- **Alignment**: Token model creates strong incentive alignment
- **Innovation**: Represents next generation of regenerative finance models
- **Composability**: Can integrate with other DeFi primitives

### Considerations
- **Complexity**: More complex technically and conceptually
- **Market Dependency**: Token value potentially affected by market volatility
- **Regulatory Questions**: Novel structure creates regulatory uncertainty

## 3. Minimalist Multisig with DeFi Integration

### Overview
- Start with a simple multisig wallet managing funds
- Integrate directly with established DeFi protocols
- Manual distribution of yield initially, with pathway to automation
- Focus on getting capital deployed quickly rather than perfect governance

### Implementation
- Use Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) or similar established multisig
- Direct integration with yield protocols via existing adapters
- Transparent reporting through blockchain explorers
- Can evolve governance as fund grows

### Timeline & Cost
- **Setup Timeline**: 2-4 weeks
- **Estimated Cost**: $5,000-10,000
- **Operational Requirements**: Active management by multisig signers

### Advantages
- **Simplicity**: Easiest to understand and implement
- **Speed**: Fastest path to deployment
- **Flexibility**: Can evolve structure as fund grows
- **Low Cost**: Minimal upfront investment required

### Considerations
- **Centralization**: Depends on trusted operators
- **Manual Operations**: More human intervention required initially
- **Limited Automation**: Fewer automated safety features than other options

## 4. Octant-Inspired Staking Model

### Overview
- Similar to Octant's approach described in research
- Stakers lock funds and earn rewards while gaining input on allocation
- Quadratic funding principles for impact distribution
- Epoch-based funding cycles (e.g., quarterly distributions)

### Implementation
- Create staking contracts that manage yield generation
- Build simple interface for impact allocation voting
- Start with curated impact options, expand with growth
- Implement quadratic funding distribution mechanisms

### Timeline & Cost
- **Setup Timeline**: 2-3 months
- **Estimated Cost**: $20,000-35,000
- **Operational Requirements**: Community management, technical maintenance

### Advantages
- **Proven Model**: Based on established approach with demonstrated success
- **Community Governance**: Strong participation model for allocation decisions
- **Quadratic Benefits**: More democratic funding distribution
- **Regular Cycles**: Creates momentum through funding epochs

### Considerations
- **Technical Requirements**: More complex voting and distribution mechanisms
- **Education Need**: Requires participant education on quadratic funding
- **Scale Dependency**: Benefits increase with greater participation

## Recommended Approach

For the Impact Yield Fund, we recommend starting with the **Minimalist Multisig with DeFi Integration** (Option 3) as the initial implementation, with a clear roadmap to evolve toward the **DAO Treasury with Yield Allocation** (Option 1) as the fund scales.

This approach provides:
- The fastest path to launch (within weeks)
- Minimal upfront capital requirements 
- Full on-chain implementation
- A clear pathway to greater decentralization
- Opportunity for learning and iteration
- Progressive enhancement of features as needs evolve

### Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Minimalist Launch** (Months 1-2)
   - Establish multisig with trusted operators
   - Deploy initial capital to proven yield protocols
   - Create transparent reporting mechanisms
   - Document governance procedures

2. **Phase 2: Enhanced Automation** (Months 3-4)
   - Implement smart contracts for automated yield splitting
   - Develop impact tracking system
   - Create simple allocation dashboard

3. **Phase 3: DAO Transition** (Months 5-6)
   - Implement DAO governance layer
   - Transition from multisig to community governance
   - Expand impact allocation mechanisms

This phased approach allows us to begin creating impact quickly while building toward a more sophisticated and decentralized structure over time.

## Connection to Impact Thesis

The recommended structure is particularly well-suited to the Community Economic Resilience impact thesis, as it:

1. Models the decentralized governance principles we aim to support
2. Provides flexibility for funding diverse community initiatives
3. Creates low operational overhead, maximizing funds available for impact
4. Enables rapid iteration based on community feedback
5. Demonstrates Web3 principles in action through its own operation
