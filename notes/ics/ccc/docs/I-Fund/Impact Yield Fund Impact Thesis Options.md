# Impact Yield Fund Impact Thesis Options

This document outlines potential impact focus areas for the Impact Yield Fund, with Community Economic Resilience as the primary recommendation, alongside Environmental Regeneration and Open Technology Commons as alternative options.

## Primary Focus: Community Economic Resilience

### Core Problem Being Addressed

Communities increasingly face economic fragility through centralized financial systems that extract value rather than circulate it locally. The current system:
- Undervalues community-based exchange mechanisms
- Creates dependency on external capital
- Fails to recognize diverse forms of contribution
- Extracts wealth from communities rather than circulating it
- Limits access to economic participation

### Solution Approach

The IYF will direct yield toward initiatives that strengthen community economic resilience by focusing on:

#### 1. Seeding Local Exchange Systems
- Funding initial liquidity for community exchange networks
- Supporting technical infrastructure for local currencies and exchange systems
- Creating multiplier effects where each dollar can support 5-10x its value in community exchanges
- Enabling value exchange outside traditional financial systems

#### 2. Building Economic Commons
- Funding shared community resources with regenerative governance
- Supporting cooperative ownership models of essential services
- Developing on-chain tools for resource pooling and sharing
- Creating infrastructure for community wealth-building

#### 3. Enabling Value Recognition
- Creating attestation systems for community contributions
- Developing mechanisms to value care work and other traditionally unpaid labor
- Building bridges between community value and financial capital
- Supporting time-banking and service exchange platforms

#### 4. Skill & Capacity Building
- Training and education in financial literacy
- Developing governance capacity for economic self-determination
- Building technical skills for participation in new economic models
- Creating knowledge commons around community economics

### Measurement Framework

- **Participation Metrics**: Number of community members actively engaged in alternative economic systems
- **Transaction Volume**: Measured in both traditional currency and alternative units of account
- **Wealth Circulation**: Indicators of how wealth circulates within communities rather than extracting outward
- **Economic Diversity**: Measures of diverse participation across demographic and socioeconomic factors
- **On-Chain Attestations**: Community-verified impact claims linked to specific initiatives and outcomes
- **Multiplier Effect**: Capital efficiency in generating community exchange activity

### On-Chain Implementation

- **Hypercerts for Community Impact**: Issue Hypercerts capturing quantifiable community economic outcomes
- **Transparent Fund Flows**: All distributions from impact treasury publicly traceable
- **Attestation Networks**: Community stakeholders provide verified evidence of impact
- **DAO-Based Governance**: Community input on funding priorities through on-chain voting
- **Open Impact Measurement**: Transparent, verifiable impact metrics

### London, Ontario Pilot Implementation

The pilot would:
- Deploy initial capital to seed a community exchange network
- Work with ICS to identify 5-10 local businesses/service providers as anchors
- Create templates for membership and participation
- Develop on-chain tracking of community exchange activity
- Document multiplier effects and community benefits
- Create replicable models for other communities

### Alignment with SuperBenefit Mission

This impact thesis directly supports SuperBenefit's mission of reimagining power by:
- Decentralizing economic systems and decision-making
- Creating infrastructure for community self-determination
- Building bridges between Web3 and tangible community needs
- Demonstrating viable alternatives to extractive economics

## Alternative Option A: Environmental Regeneration

### Core Problem Being Addressed

Environmental degradation continues at an alarming rate, with inadequate financial mechanisms to support restoration and regeneration efforts. Current systems:
- Undervalue ecological services
- Fail to direct sufficient capital to conservation and restoration
- Lack transparent tracking of environmental outcomes
- Rely on philanthropy rather than sustainable financing models

### Solution Approach

The IYF would direct yield toward initiatives that support environmental regeneration:

#### 1. Habitat Restoration
- Funding for ecosystem restoration projects
- Support for community-led conservation initiatives
- Mechanisms to recognize and value biodiversity

#### 2. Regenerative Agriculture
- Capital for transition to regenerative practices
- Support for local food systems
- Infrastructure for community-supported agriculture

#### 3. Climate Action
- Funding for carbon sequestration projects
- Support for community resilience to climate impacts
- Development of local climate adaptation infrastructure

### Measurement Framework

- **Ecological Indicators**: Science-based metrics for ecosystem health
- **Carbon Sequestration**: Verified carbon removal and storage
- **Biodiversity Metrics**: Species diversity and ecosystem function measures
- **Community Participation**: Engagement in environmental stewardship

### On-Chain Implementation

- **Environmental Credits**: Integration with carbon credits and biodiversity certificates
- **Regenerative Outcome Tokens**: Tokenized environmental outcomes
- **Verification Systems**: On-chain environmental impact verification

## Alternative Option B: Open Technology Commons

### Core Problem Being Addressed

Essential digital infrastructure is increasingly controlled by profit-driven entities, limiting access and creating dependencies. Current technology ecosystems:
- Concentrate power in a few large corporations
- Create extractive relationships with users
- Underinvest in public digital infrastructure
- Prioritize growth over community benefit

### Solution Approach

The IYF would direct yield toward initiatives that create and maintain open technology commons:

#### 1. Public Digital Infrastructure
- Support for open-source software development
- Funding for community-owned networks
- Infrastructure for data sovereignty

#### 2. Tech for Good
- Funding for technology addressing social challenges
- Support for privacy-preserving tools
- Development of ethical AI applications

#### 3. Digital Skills & Literacy
- Education programs for technology access
- Community technology centers
- Training for participation in digital governance

### Measurement Framework

- **Adoption Metrics**: Usage and implementation of open technologies
- **Contribution Indicators**: Community involvement in development
- **Access Measures**: Expanded access to technology resources
- **Community Value Assessment**: Benefits generated for users

### On-Chain Implementation

- **Contribution Tracking**: On-chain recognition of open-source contributions
- **Usage Metrics**: Transparent monitoring of technology adoption
- **Value Distribution**: Fair compensation for maintainers and contributors

## Assessment Criteria

When selecting an impact focus, the following criteria should be considered:

1. **Alignment with Values**: How well does the focus align with SuperBenefit's mission and values?
2. **Implementation Feasibility**: Can meaningful impact be achieved with available resources?
3. **Measurement Capacity**: How effectively can outcomes be tracked and verified?
4. **Stakeholder Interest**: Will the focus attract support from investors and community participants?
5. **Differentiation**: How does this approach differ from existing initiatives?
6. **Multiplier Effect**: What additional benefits might emerge beyond direct impacts?

## Recommendation

Based on alignment with SuperBenefit's mission, feasibility of implementation, and potential for demonstrating the value of on-chain impact tracking, we recommend **Community Economic Resilience** as the primary impact focus for the Impact Yield Fund.

This focus area:
- Directly addresses core issues of economic power and community resilience
- Creates natural alignment with the fund's structure and governance
- Offers clear pathways for on-chain implementation
- Provides tangible benefits to communities
- Demonstrates the principles the fund seeks to promote through its own operation

While the alternative options offer valuable impact potential, Community Economic Resilience provides the strongest foundation for initial implementation, with possibilities to incorporate elements of environmental regeneration and open technology commons as the fund evolves.
