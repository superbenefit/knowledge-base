# How to Use This Guide

This comprehensive guide to the Community Connection & Commitment Commons (C4) is organized into logical sections to help you find the information you need.

## Document Organization

The guide is structured into the following main sections:

1. **A. Introduction**: Overview, executive summary, and navigation aids
   
2. **B. Overview**: Foundational concepts, principles, and terminology
   
3. **C. Implementation**: Operational framework including onboarding, technology, timeline, governance, and risk management
   
4. **D. Examples**: Practical examples and scenarios for how the system works in action
   
5. **E. Guides**: Step-by-step guidance for participants in different roles
   
6. **F. Activities**: Community events and gatherings that support the system
   
7. **G. Future**: Long-term vision, scaling strategies, and potential expansions
   
8. **H. Reference**: Additional resources, glossary, and frequently asked questions

## Reading Approaches

You can approach this documentation in several ways:

- **Sequential reading**: Start with the executive summary and proceed through each section for a comprehensive understanding of the system.

- **Role-based reading**: 
  - **Potential members** may want to focus on sections B (Overview), D (Examples), and E (Guides)
  - **Stewards and facilitators** should pay special attention to C (Implementation) and F (Activities)
  - **Community leaders and partners** might find B (Overview) and G (Future) most relevant

- **Reference use**: The table of contents and section H (Reference) provide quick access to specific information as needed.

## Document Status

Version 0.2 represents a complete draft of the system documentation. While the content is comprehensive, visual elements (diagrams, illustrations, etc.) will be developed in version 0.3.

We welcome feedback on this documentation to help improve clarity, address gaps, and refine the system design before the pilot launch.
