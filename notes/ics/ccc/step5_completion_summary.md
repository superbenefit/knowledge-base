   - Verified consistent use of terms across all files
   - Confirmed key parameters (credit limits, expirations, etc.)

3. **Created final harmonization guidelines**:
   - Developed formatting standards
   - Listed terminology conventions
   - Identified inconsistencies to address

4. **Prepared PDF compilation materials**:

## Next Steps

The project is now ready for final compilation into a professional PDF presentation. The detailed instructions in `pdf_compilation_guide.md` provide several options for creating this final document, from simple to more sophisticated approaches.

To produce the final PDF:
1. Review the harmonization notes for any final edits needed
2. Use the compilation guide to create the PDF
3. Review the compiled document for formatting or content issues
4. Distribute to potential stewards and founding members

The Community Exchange project documentation is now complete and ready for implementation starting in Q2 2025 as outlined in the implementation timeline.
