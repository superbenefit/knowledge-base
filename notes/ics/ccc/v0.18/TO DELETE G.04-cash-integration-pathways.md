# Cash Integration Pathways

While the Community Exchange begins as a cashless system focused on mutual support through commitment pooling, thoughtful integration with the cash economy may become beneficial as the system matures. Here are potential pathways:

## 1. Anchor Business Model

**Phase 1: Single Trusted Anchor (6-18 months after launch)**
- Reimagine Co becomes the first "anchor business" that can accept credits for meals
- Credits used at Reimagine can be redeemed for cash at a predetermined rate (e.g., 1 credit = $8 cash)
- This creates a "cash-out" option without opening the entire system to cash exchange
- Limiting to one trusted business maintains system integrity during this crucial phase

**Phase 2: Expanded Anchor Network (Year 2+)**
- Additional established businesses can apply to become anchor businesses if they meet criteria:
  - At least 6 months of active participation in the Exchange
  - Demonstrated commitment to community values
  - Approval by 75% of active participants
- Each anchor business can define its own redemption rate within community-approved parameters
- Regular review of anchor businesses ensures continued alignment with community values

**Example Implementation with Reimagine Co:**
- Reimagine "seeds" the pool with meal vouchers (e.g., 10 meals per month)
- Community members earn credits through various contributions
- Credits can be redeemed for meals at Reimagine
- Reimagine can redeem accumulated credits for cash from a community fund, or use them to "purchase" services from the community (event help, delivery, etc.)

## 2. Tiered Membership Structure

A future option could include different membership tiers that bridge commitment-based and cash economies:

**Individual Membership Tiers:**
- **Standard Members**: Exchange based entirely on commitments and credits
- **Supporting Members**: Optional cash contributions that support the system infrastructure while participating in exchanges
- **Sponsoring Members**: Cash contributions that support both infrastructure and create credits for those facing barriers to participation

**Organizational Membership Tiers:**
- **Community Partners**: Non-profit organizations that contribute and receive services
- **Business Members**: Local businesses that integrate with the Exchange in limited, structured ways
- **Institutional Supporters**: Larger organizations that provide financial or infrastructural support

## 3. Community Development Fund

A future innovation could involve creating a community-controlled development fund:

- A percentage of all exchanges (e.g., 5%) generates credits placed in a community fund
- The fund can be used for:
  - Supporting new initiatives within the community
  - Backing certain credits with cash when needed
  - Developing community assets
  - Providing credit "scholarships" to new members facing barriers
- Governance of the fund would involve all members through proposals and voting processes
