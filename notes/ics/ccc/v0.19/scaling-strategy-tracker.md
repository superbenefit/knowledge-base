# G.02 Scaling Strategy - Task Tracker

## Prompt for future LLM:
This document tracks progress on updating G.02-scaling-strategy.md by incorporating concrete, real-world scaling opportunities identified by Heenal in the next 6-24 months. These opportunities need to be integrated into the G-Future directory as individual documentation files and reflected in the scaling strategy.

## Task Overview

### Phase 1: Document Future Possibilities (COMPLETE)
- [x] Create/update individual documents for each scaling opportunity in G-Future folder
- [x] Document Woodfield/Old East Village/Old South neighbourhoods use case (G.05)
- [x] Document Corduroy/Xuux artist collective collaboration (G.06)
- [x] Document Journeyland community gatherings integration (G.07)
- [x] Document ICS credits backed by $ implementation (G.08)
- [x] Document Reimagine meal credits system (G.03)
- [x] Document Citizen Wallet integration (G.04)
- [x] Document MAPLE CAD stablecoin concept (G.02)
- [x] Document Impact Yield Fund concept (G.10)
- [x] Clean up G-Future directory: removed obsolete docs (old future-possibilities series and duplicate citizen wallet docs)
- [x] Renumber G-Future docs from G.01-G.12 in logical order

### Phase 2: Update Scaling Strategy Document (IN PROGRESS)

#### Recently Completed:
- [x] **C.06: Success Metrics Simplified** - Reduced complexity from 6 categories to 5 key metrics
  - Active Participation (30% monthly)
  - Credit Flow Velocity (under 30 days average)
  - Request Fulfillment (50% within 30 days)
  - Community Trust (90% positive experiences)
  - System Growth (1-2 new commitments quarterly)
  - Simplified tracking to monthly checks, quarterly surveys, annual review

#### Currently Documented:
- [x] **G.11: MAPLE Stablecoin** - CAD stablecoin integration with Community Exchange
  - Parallel regenerative currency like $BREAD
  - Bridge between CCC pools and broader economy
  - BREAD-MAPLE liquidity pairs
  - Phase 1: USD collateralization → Phase 2: Canadian assets
  - Dynamic yield distribution model
  - Green Pill Network partnership

- [x] **G.12: Citizen Wallet Integration** - Web3 accessibility solution
  - Purpose-built for community currencies
  - Gasless, sponsorable transactions
  - Physical-digital bridge (NFC cards, QR codes)
  - Tiered identity system (anonymous → community → verified)
  - Proven technology (Brussels Pay case study)
  - Scott Morris connection and expertise

#### Recently Completed Tasks:
- [x] **Updated G.01-scaling-strategy.md** with comprehensive references
  - Added complete "Future Possibilities Directory" section
  - Referenced all G-Future docs with descriptions and links
  - Integrated specific use cases throughout scaling phases
  - Enhanced digital infrastructure with Citizen Wallet + MAPLE
- [x] **Defined Neighbourhood Scaling Pathway**
  - Outlined progression with Woodfield pilot as starting point
  - Detailed inter-circle connections with concrete examples
  - Added MAPLE as bridge currency concept
  - Integrated Journeyland events for inter-circle gatherings
- [x] **Documented Pool Interconnection Strategies**
  - Added protocols for direct credit clearing
  - Established MAPLE as automated settlement bridge
  - Created framework for complex inter-pool exchanges
  - Connected to Citizen Wallet infrastructure
- [x] **Created Compensation Evolution Model**
  - Defined three-phase transition (volunteer → hybrid → full compensation)
  - Established 10-20% initial compensation threshold
  - Listed funding pathways including IYF and MAPLE yield
- [x] **Expanded Cash Integration Framework**
  - Built comprehensive tiered integration model
  - Connected ICS backing, MAPLE bridge, and anchor businesses
  - Created 3-level structure for services and offerings

#### Remaining Tasks (Implementation Focus):
- [ ] **Define Specific Success Metrics** for each scaling phase
  - Quantifiable targets for neighborhood expansion
  - Credit velocity benchmarks for pool health
  - Inter-circle exchange volume targets
  - Compensation transition triggers
- [ ] **Create Neighborhood Selection Framework**
  - Document Woodfield selection rationale
  - Develop criteria for future neighborhoods
  - Define readiness assessment process
- [ ] **Design Artist Collective Pilot**
  - Detail Corduroy/Xuux integration specifics
  - Create credit structures for creative services
  - Design event-based exchange protocols
- [ ] **Establish Circle Steward Training**
  - Create training modules for new stewards
  - Design onboarding process for expanding circles
  - Document steward rotation and succession planning

### Phase 3: Integration Review (Not Started)
- [ ] Ensure all future docs reference each other appropriately
- [ ] Verify that existing G-Future docs are compatible with new opportunities
- [ ] Check for any G-Future docs that may need updating or removal
- [ ] Create connection matrix between different scaling opportunities

## Progress Status

**Current Stage:** Phase 2 Nearing Completion
**Recent Work:** 
- ✓ Cleaned up G-Future directory (marked obsolete files for deletion)
- ✓ Renumbered all G-Future docs from G.01-G.12
- ✓ Consolidated citizen wallet documentation to latest version
- ✓ Simplified success metrics (C.06)
- ✓ Detailed CAD stablecoin (MAPLE) design (G.02)
- ✓ Citizen Wallet integration strategy (G.04)
- ✓ Updated G.01-scaling-strategy.md with:
  - Complete reference to reorganized G-Future docs
  - Enhanced technology roadmap with Citizen Wallet + MAPLE
  - Compensation evolution from volunteer to paid roles
  - Cash integration pathways and ICS backing model
  - Detailed scaling sequence with dependencies
  - Concrete implementation timeline

**Next Steps:** 
1. **Complete implementation planning**
   - Define specific success metrics for each scaling phase
   - Create detailed onboarding framework for first neighborhood
   - Design artist collective pilot specifications
   - Establish Circle Steward training curriculum
2. **Begin practical preparation**
   - Configure Citizen Wallet for London deployment
   - Document first neighborhood selection criteria
   - Create template for Circle formation process

## Technology Integration Updates

### Web3 Infrastructure
- **Citizen Wallet**: Confirmed as primary wallet solution for onboarding
- **MAPLE**: Planned as bridge currency between CCC and broader Canadian economy
- **Gas Sponsorship**: ICS can sponsor transactions (~$0.001 per transaction on Celo)

### Wallet Comparison Matrix
| Feature | Citizen Wallet | Traditional Wallets |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Community focus | ✓ Specialized | × Generic crypto |
| No signup required | ✓ Yes | × No |
| Physical payment options | ✓ Yes | × No |
| Gas-free experience | ✓ Yes | × No |

## Notes
- Keep existing G-Future docs unless they need updating/removal
- Each opportunity should have its own dedicated document
- Focus on practical implementation possibilities
- Consider interconnections between different scaling opportunities
- Three-tiered identity/trust levels enable progressive community engagement
- MAPLE-BREAD interoperability opens cross-border regenerative finance opportunities
