## Scaling Principles

Our growth strategy is guided by these core principles:

1. **Relationship-Based Growth**: Expanding through existing relationships rather than mass recruitment
2. **Maintain Quality**: Preserving the high-trust environment as we grow
3. **Nested Circles**: Creating new circles rather than indefinitely expanding a single group
4. **Infrastructure Before Growth**: Ensuring our systems can support each expansion phase
5. **Evolutionary Approach**: Learning and adapting as we grow

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Q2-Q3 2025)

### Focus: Quality Over Quantity

- Development of onboarding materials and processes
- Training of initial stewards

### Success Metrics
- 80% of founding members actively participating
- At least 30 total exchanges completed
- Core documentation and systems in place
- Positive member feedback on initial experience

## Phase 2: Controlled Expansion (Q4 2025-Q1 2026)

### Focus: Testing Growth Mechanisms
- Allow founding members to invite new participants
- Refine onboarding processes based on experience
- Begin technology transition to more scalable platform

- 75% retention rate of new members
- 80% of new members complete first exchange within 30 days

## Phase 3: Nested Growth (Q1-Q4 2026)

### Focus: Creating New Circles
- Support formation of new circles based on geography or interest
- Establish inter-circle exchange protocols
- Develop circle steward training program
- Create shared resources and autonomy balance

### Circle Formation Models
1. **Geographic Circles**:
   - Neighbourhood-based groups
   - Local exchanges for frequent, proximity-based needs
   - Inter-circle exchanges for specialized needs

2. **Interest-Based Circles**:
   - Groups formed around shared interests or needs
   - Examples: food production, childcare, home repair
   - Specialized exchange density within circles

3. **Organizational Circles**:
   - Based in existing organizations (cooperatives, non-profits)
   - Leveraging established relationships
   - Bridging organizational resources with community needs

### Inter-Circle Connections
- **Bridge Members**: Participants in multiple circles who facilitate connections
- **Credit Clearing**: Systems for exchanges across circle boundaries
  - Direct credit exchange between pools when possible
  - MAPLE stablecoin as bridge currency for complex exchanges
  - Automated settlement via Citizen Wallet infrastructure
- **Joint Events**: Regular gatherings bringing multiple circles together
  - Journeyland-style community gatherings for inter-circle connection

   - Identification of local needs and offerings
   - Assessment of potential membership

3. **Formation**
   - Formal agreement to form a circle
   - Steward training and mentorship
   - Setup of circle-specific systems
   - Initial member onboarding

4. **Launch**
   - Kickoff celebration
   - First round of exchanges
   - Regular neighborhood gatherings
   - Inter-circle connection establishment

5. **Growth and Autonomy**
   - Gradual expansion through local relationships
   - Development of neighborhood-specific practices
   - Regular coordination with other circles
   - Eventual formation of satellite circles as needed

## Invitation System for Sustainable Growth

Rather than unlimited growth, we use a staged invitation system:

### Stage 1: Founding Invitation (Q2-Q3 2025)
- Stewards directly invite founding members
- Focused on diversity of skills, resources, and perspectives
- High-touch onboarding and relationship building

### Stage 2: Member Invitation (Q4 2025-Q1 2026)
- Each founding member can invite up to 2 new members
- New members must participate for 3 months before gaining invitation privileges
- Focus on relationship quality and system capacity

### Stage 3: Circle Formation (Q2-Q4 2026)
- Members can form new circles with 5+ interested people
- New circles develop their own invitation protocols
- Original circle provides mentorship and support

### Stage 4: Open Pathways (2027+)
- Multiple entry points to the network
- Clear processes for both individual and group participation
- Balance between openness and maintaining quality

## Learning and Adaptation

Our scaling strategy is not fixed but evolving based on:

- **Regular Evaluation**: Quarterly review of growth metrics and quality indicators
- **Member Feedback**: Ongoing collection of experiences and suggestions
- **Cross-Pollination**: Learning from other community exchange systems
- **Emergent Patterns**: Noticing and supporting organic developments

We'll formally review and update this scaling strategy:
- After the first invitation round (Q1 2026)
- As the first new circle forms
- Annually thereafter

---

This scaling strategy represents our current thinking and will evolve as we learn and grow. The core commitment remains: growing in ways that strengthen rather than dilute our values, relationships, and effectiveness.
