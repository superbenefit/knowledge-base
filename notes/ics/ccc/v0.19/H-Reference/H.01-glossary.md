# Community Exchange: Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the Community Exchange documentation. These definitions align with the framework described in "Grassroots Economics: Reflection and Practice" while adapting to our local context.

## Core Concepts

**Community Exchange** - Our local system combining Connection Circles and Commitment Pooling to enable resource sharing and community building outside the conventional money economy.

**Connection Circles** - Community gatherings where people share what they want to learn and what they can teach or offer, building relationships and identifying community resources.

**Commitment Pool** - A shared system where members formalize offers of goods and services, which can be exchanged using credits.

**Credit** - The unit of account within our system. One credit represents approximately 30 minutes of time or $10 of value, though this is a guideline rather than a strict rule.

**Commitment** - A promise to provide a specific good or service to the community pool, which can be claimed by other members. When fulfilled, the provider earns credits.

**Pool** - The common space (digital or conceptual) where commitments are aggregated and tracked, allowing members to give and receive value.

**Steward** - A member with additional responsibilities for managing the system, including onboarding new members, maintaining records, and facilitating community processes.

## Protocol Functions

**Curation** - The process of determining which commitments can enter the pool. In our system, this is managed by stewards who ensure offerings align with community values.

**Valuation** - The process of determining the relative value of different commitments (e.g., 1 hour of childcare = 2 credits).

**Limitation** - Boundaries set to maintain system health, such as credit limits (maximum 10 credits per person) and expiration periods (credits expire after 3 months of inactivity).

**Exchange** - The process of giving and receiving commitments through the pool, facilitated by the credit system.

## Operational Terms

**Connection Circle** - A gathering where members share skills, interests, and needs, forming the relational foundation of the exchange.

**Credit Balance** - The number of credits a member currently holds, reflecting their contributions to the community minus what they've received.

**Credit Limit** - The maximum number of credits a member can hold (10) or owe (-10) at any given time.

**Expiration** - Credits expire after 3 months of inactivity to encourage circulation and prevent hoarding.

**Ledger** - The record-keeping system (initially Google Sheets, later Sarafu.Network) that tracks all commitments, exchanges, and credit balances.

**Mutual Credit** - A form of alternative currency or exchange system where participants issue credit to each other in the form of promises denominated in a uniform unit of account. When a trade occurs, the accounts of the buyer and seller are adjusted accordingly, with the buyer's account debited and the seller's credited. The sum of credits and debits across all accounts always equals zero. Mutual credit systems typically operate with bilateral transactions and credit limits.

**Sarafu Network** - An open-source platform developed by Grassroots Economics Foundation that enables communities to create, manage, and exchange digital commitment tokens. The network allows users to issue their own vouchers representing commitments to provide goods or services, pool these vouchers with others, and exchange them within their community. Operating in Kenya and other regions, Sarafu Network serves as a digital implementation of traditional resource coordination practices, helping communities build economic resilience through interconnected pools of commitments. We plan to transition to this platform for managing our commitment pool (Phase 2).

**Stewardship Circle** - The group of members responsible for facilitating the Community Exchange system.

## Related Concepts

**Grassroots Economics** - Both a non-profit foundation based in Kenya and a field of study focused on resource coordination protocols that emerge from community practices. The foundation is known for developing the Sarafu Network, an open-source platform for digital commitment pooling that has supported communities across East Africa. The term also refers more broadly to economic systems built from the ground up by communities themselves, often rediscovering and adapting ancestral practices for resource sharing and mutual support.

**Barter** - The direct exchange of goods or services without using money. While often considered the historical precursor to monetary systems, anthropological evidence suggests that credit systems and gift economies often preceded barter in many societies. Barter is limited by the "double coincidence of wants" - requiring both parties to desire exactly what the other offers.

**Circular Economy** - An economic system aimed at eliminating waste and continually reusing resources by keeping products and materials in use through reuse, sharing, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling. Community Exchange principles align with circular economy by facilitating the sharing and reuse of resources within a local network.

**Commitment Pooling** - A resource coordination system where participants contribute commitments to provide specific goods or services into a common pool that others can access. Unlike mutual credit which uses a uniform currency unit, commitment pooling tracks diverse, non-uniform commitments (e.g., childcare hours, bread loaves, carpentry services) and manages them through protocols for curation, valuation, limitation, and exchange. The pool serves as a multilateral exchange mechanism where participants can draw on resources offered by any member, creating greater flexibility than traditional barter or bilateral mutual credit.

**Commons/Common-Pool Resources** - Shared resources that a community manages for collective benefit according to established protocols and rules. This includes both natural resources (forests, fisheries) and created resources (knowledge, infrastructure). Commitment pools function similarly to commons by creating shared access to resources under collectively established rules.

**Demurrage** - A fee or cost associated with holding commitments over time, designed to encourage circulation rather than hoarding of resources. In our system, this takes the form of credit expiration after a period of inactivity.

**Mutual Aid** - A voluntary reciprocal exchange of resources and services for mutual benefit, based on the principle "from each according to ability, to each according to need." Unlike charity, mutual aid establishes horizontal, reciprocal relationships where people support each other rather than creating hierarchical giver-receiver dynamics.

**Reciprocity** - The practice of exchanging things with others for mutual benefit.

**Resilience** - The capacity to recover quickly from difficulties; in economics, the ability to adapt to changing conditions while maintaining core functions.

**Timebanking** - A reciprocity-based work trading system where time is the principal currency. For every hour participants contribute to helping another person or working on a community project, they earn one time credit which they can use to receive services from others in the network. All hours are valued equally, regardless of the service provided.

**Rotating Labor Association (ROLA)** - A traditional practice found across cultures worldwide where community members take turns providing labor for each other's projects. Examples include Mweria (Kenya), Meitheal (Ireland), and Gotong Royong (Indonesia), demonstrating how communities coordinate shared labor without using money.
