# Organizational Development

As the system grows, governance and organizational structures may evolve:

## 1. Legal Structure Options

Potential formal structures to consider:

- **Community Interest Company**: A UK structure balancing social purpose with limited profit distribution
- **Cooperative**: Member-owned organization with democratic governance
- **Charitable Organization**: Focus on public benefit with charitable tax status
- **Mutual Aid Network**: Less formal structure emphasized mutual benefit
- **Digital Cooperative**: Combining cooperative principles with digital governance

## 2. Hybrid Organizations

Creating more complex organizational ecosystems:

- **Technical Support Organization**: A separate entity maintaining digital infrastructure
- **Educational Foundation**: Focus on training and knowledge sharing
- **Community Development Entity**: Supporting new local exchanges and projects
- **Research Organization**: Studying impact and sharing methodologies
- **Investment Cooperative**: Pooling resources for larger community investments
