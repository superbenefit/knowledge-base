# Community Exchange: Technology Implementation Plan

This document outlines our phased approach to implementing and transitioning technology systems for the Community Exchange.

## Technology Vision

Our technology should:
- Be accessible to members with varying technical abilities
- Prioritize transparency and trust
- Support rather than dictate our community practices
- Scale appropriately with community growth
- Balance simplicity with sufficient features
- Preserve member privacy and data sovereignty

## Three-Phase Implementation

### Phase 1: Google Sheets (Months 1-3)

#### System Setup
- Create a central Google Sheet with the following tabs:
  - Member Directory (names, contact info, skills)
  - Commitment Catalog (all available offerings)
  - Transaction Ledger (record of all exchanges)
  - Credit Balances (current standing of all members)
  - System Metrics (key statistics for monitoring health)

#### Access & Permissions
- Stewards: Edit access to all sheets
- Members: View access to most sheets, comment access on Commitment Catalog
- Public: No access

#### Documentation
- Simple user guide with screenshots
- Step-by-step instructions for common actions
- FAQ for technical troubleshooting

#### Operations
1. **Recording Transactions**:
   - Members report completed exchanges to stewards via form or email
   - Stewards update the Transaction Ledger and Credit Balances
   - Weekly reconciliation and verification

2. **Commitment Management**:
   - Members submit new commitments via form
   - Stewards review and add approved commitments to Catalog
   - Expired or fulfilled commitments marked accordingly

3. **Status Tracking**:
   - Color coding for credit balances approaching limits
   - Automated highlighting of credits approaching expiration (3-month mark)
   - Monthly reports generated for transparency

#### Benefits
- Low barrier to entry
- Familiar technology for many users
- No software development required
- Easy to modify as we learn

#### Limitations
- Manual process prone to errors
- Limited automation
- Doesn't scale well beyond ~50 members
- Dependent on stewards for updates

### Phase 2: Testing & Transition (Months 4-6)

#### Sarafu.Network Exploration
- Stewards create test accounts on Sarafu.Network
- Small group (5-8 members) joins pilot testing
- Run parallel systems (Google Sheets as primary, Sarafu as testing)
- Document learning, challenges, and successes

#### Training & Preparation
- Develop member training materials for Sarafu.Network
- Host demo sessions at community gatherings
- Create "buddy system" pairing tech-comfortable with tech-hesitant members
- Test migration of existing data to new system

#### Infrastructure Needs Assessment
- Evaluate device access among membership
- Identify potential barriers to digital participation
- Develop solutions for members with limited tech access
- Explore offline/paper backup systems if needed

#### Community Decision
- Month 6: Formal community decision about full migration
- Review testing experience and feedback
- Finalize timeline for complete transition
- Develop comprehensive transition plan

#### Reserve Currency Considerations
As the system matures, pools may naturally connect with other regenerative economies:

**Potential Connections:**
- $BREAD - a regenerative currency we admire that shares our values  
- Other commitment pool networks using $MAPLE or similar
- The broader regenerative finance ecosystem
- Conventional systems when necessary for community needs

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Each pool decides its own external connections
- Community values guide integration decisions  
- Multiple connection pathways maintain flexibility
- Local autonomy remains paramount

### Phase 3: Full Migration (Month 7+)

#### Data Migration
- Transfer all balances from Google Sheets to Sarafu.Network
- Verify accuracy of migration with audit team
- Create backup of Google Sheets system for reference

#### Comprehensive Training
- Multiple training sessions offered in various formats
- One-on-one support available for those who need it
- Written, video, and in-person learning options
- Practice transactions in safe environment

#### Parallel Operation Period
- Run both systems for 2-3 months during transition
- Weekly reconciliation between systems
- Clear communication about which system is "official"
- Gradual shift of operations to Sarafu.Network

#### Legacy System Management
- After full migration, maintain Google Sheets as backup for 3 months
- Eventually archive Google Sheets system for historical reference
- Maintain offline backup of all transaction data

## Technical Support Structure

### Support Tiers
1. **Peer Support**: Members helping members with basic questions
2. **Steward Support**: Designated tech-comfortable stewards for more complex issues
3. **Expert Support**: Connection to Sarafu.Network support if needed

### Documentation & Resources
- Maintained in the community knowledge base
- Regular updates based on common questions
- Screenshots and step-by-step guides
- Troubleshooting flowcharts

### Regular Check-ins
- Technology review as standing agenda item in monthly meetings
- Quarterly technology retrospective
- Ongoing collection of improvement suggestions

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- Mobile application development
- Integration with other community systems
- API connections to other solidarity economy tools
- Advanced reporting and metrics

### Privacy & Data Governance
- Development of formal data policy
- Member control over visible information
- Clear guidelines on data retention
- Regular privacy reviews
