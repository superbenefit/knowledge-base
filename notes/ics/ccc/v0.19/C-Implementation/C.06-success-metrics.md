# Community Exchange: Simplified Success Metrics

We track just 5 essential metrics to keep it simple and focused.

## 1. Active Participation
**Are people engaging with the system?**
- Members using credits OR attending Connection Circles
- Target: 30% actively engaged monthly (realistic for a new system)

## 2. Credit Flow
**How fast do credits move through the system?**
- Average days a credit sits before being spent (after being earned)
- Target: Less than 30 days on average (faster is better)

## 3. Request Fulfillment
**When people ask for help, do they get it?**
- Of requests made, how many get fulfilled within 30 days?
- Target: 40% of requests fulfilled within 30 days

## 4. Community Trust
**Are relationships strengthening?**
- Member satisfaction with exchanges (simple survey)
- Target: 90% positive experiences

## 5. System Growth
**Is the system expanding?**
- New commitments added to the pool each month
- Target: 3-5 new commitments added monthly

## How We Track

- **Monthly Check**: Stewards update a simple dashboard
- **Quarterly Survey**: 3-question member survey
- **Annual Review**: One-day collaborative evaluation

## Using the Metrics

If we see red flags (like too few active members or slow credit movement), we:
1. Discuss it at the next Steward Circle
2. Invite member feedback
3. Make small adjustments
4. Test for one month

Keep it simple. Focus on what matters. Adjust when needed.
