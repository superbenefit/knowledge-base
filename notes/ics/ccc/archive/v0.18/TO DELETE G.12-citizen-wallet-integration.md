# Citizen Wallet Integration with Community Exchange (CCC)

## Overview

Citizen Wallet is a purpose-built wallet system designed specifically for community currencies and local economic systems. Unlike mainstream crypto wallets (Rainbow, MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.), Citizen Wallet specializes in making Web3 accessible to non-technical users and supporting community token economies.

## Why Citizen Wallet for CCC?

### 1. Community Currency Focus

**Citizen Wallet** is uniquely designed for:
- Community tokens and local currencies
- Non-technical, everyday users
- Physical-meets-digital payment options
- Simplified onboarding without crypto complexity

**Traditional Wallets** (Rainbow, MetaMask, Coinbase):
- Designed for crypto traders and DeFi enthusiasts
- Assume technical knowledge
- Focused on individual asset management

### 2. Actual Citizen Wallet Features

#### Native Wallet Features:
- **Instant Web Wallets**: No signup required for immediate onboarding
- **Phone Number Accounts**: Optional persistent accounts with phone verification
- **Gasless Transactions**: Uses EIP-4337 account abstraction for sponsored transactions

- **QR Code Payments**: Scan to pay/receive
- **Community-Specific Tokens**: Manage multiple community currencies in one interface
- **Paper Vouchers**: Generate physical vouchers with QR codes

#### CCC-Specific Implementations (to be built):
- **Tiered Access Levels**: Based on community role (member vs steward)
- **Pool-Specific Views**: Customized interface for accessing different commitment pools
- **Bilingual Interface**: English/French for Canadian context
- **Integration with Sarafu.Network**: Custom smart contract interactions

### 3. Integration Possibilities
