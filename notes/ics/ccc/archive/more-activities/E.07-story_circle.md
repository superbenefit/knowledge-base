# Story Circle

## Purpose
To deepen relationships, share experiences, build empathy, and strengthen community bonds through structured storytelling.

## Overview
The Story Circle is a powerful practice that creates space for authentic sharing and deep listening. Unlike casual conversation, the Story Circle uses intentional structure to ensure every voice is heard without interruption or commentary. By inviting members to share personal experiences around a common theme, this practice cultivates understanding across differences, reveals shared values, and builds the trust necessary for a thriving Community Exchange. The Story Circle honors both the wisdom in each person's experience and the power of collective witness.
