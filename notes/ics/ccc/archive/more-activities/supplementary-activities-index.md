## Implementation Recommendations

These supplementary activities should be introduced gradually after the core commitment pooling system is functioning well. Consider adding them based on:

1. Expressed community interest or needs
2. Available facilitation capacity
3. Alignment with community goals and values
4. Seasonal appropriateness

Each activity includes detailed implementation guidelines, credit structures, and adaptation options that can be customized to your specific community context.
