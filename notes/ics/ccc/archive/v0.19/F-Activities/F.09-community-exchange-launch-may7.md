# Community Connection & Commitment Commons: Launch Event Plan - May 7, 2025

## Goals & Purpose

This inaugural event serves as our Community Connection & Commitment Commons launch, combining elements of new member orientation and Belonging Circles to introduce the concept to initial participants. Rather than conducting separate one-on-one onboarding sessions followed by group activities, this event will function as a cohort-based introduction to the system.

### Primary Objectives:
1. Create a welcoming, engaging experience that embodies our community values
2. Clearly explain the Community Connection & Commitment Commons model and its benefits
3. Help participants identify their own potential offerings and needs
4. Facilitate initial connections and potential exchanges
5. Build momentum and excitement for ongoing participation
6. Establish the foundation for our first member cohort

## Event Details

**Date:** Wednesday, May 7, 2025  
**Time:** 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM  
**Location:** [Venue Name and Address]  
**Capacity:** 20-30 participants  
**Facilitators:** [Names of 3-4 main facilitators]

## Detailed Flow & Activities

### Pre-Event Setup (5:00-6:00 PM)
- Arrange seating in circle or small clusters
- Set up welcome table with name tags, sign-in sheet, and handouts
- Prepare refreshments area
- Set up activity stations and materials
- Test audio/visual equipment
- Brief volunteer team on roles and responsibilities

### Welcome & Arrival (6:00-6:20 PM)
- **Community Abundance Bingo**: As participants arrive, they receive a bingo card with squares describing different skills, resources, and knowledge (e.g., "Grows vegetables," "Knows how to fix bicycles," "Has carpentry tools"). Participants mingle and find others who match the descriptions, marking their cards and learning about each other's potential offerings.
- **Materials needed**: Custom bingo cards, pens, clipboards, name tags, marker
- **Facilitation note**: Have 1-2 greeters at entrance to welcome people, explain the bingo activity, and ensure everyone has a name tag that includes both name and pronouns.

### Opening Circle (6:20-6:40 PM)
- **Welcome & Land Acknowledgment** (3 min): Brief welcome that acknowledges the traditional territory and connects care for land with care for community.
- **Introduction to Community Connection & Commitment Commons** (7 min): Concise overview of the core concept, values, and how the Commitment Commons works.
- **Grounding Meditation** (5 min): Short guided meditation focusing on abundance, interconnection, and gratitude.
- **Intention Setting** (5 min): Participants share in pairs what brought them here and what they hope to experience.
- **Materials needed**: Talking piece, chime or bell, visual aid showing commitment pool concept
- **Facilitation note**: Keep explanations simple and relatable; focus on building a warm, welcoming atmosphere rather than explaining all system details.

### Connection Games (6:40-7:00 PM)
- **Spectrum Lines** (10 min): Facilitator presents statements and participants physically position themselves along a spectrum to indicate their response (e.g., "I'm very comfortable asking for help" to "I find it challenging to ask for help"). Brief sharing after each positioning.
- **Skills Snowball** (10 min): Participants write a skill they enjoy sharing on a piece of paper, crumple it into a "snowball," and toss it in the center. Everyone picks up a random snowball and finds its author to learn more about that skill.
- **Materials needed**: Tape for spectrum line, small paper sheets, pens
- **Facilitation note**: These activities should energize the room while deepening awareness of what people might exchange.

### Needs & Offers (7:00-7:20 PM)
- **Resource Mapping** (7 min): Individual reflection using a guided worksheet to identify:
  - Skills and knowledge I can offer
  - Physical resources I might share
  - Support or services I need or want
  - What I'm curious to learn
- **Commitment Creation** (13 min): Participants create at least two initial "commitment cards" describing something specific they can offer to the pool. Facilitators circulate to help frame these clearly.
- **Materials needed**: Resource mapping worksheets, commitment cards, examples of well-formed commitments, pens
- **Facilitation note**: Emphasize quality over quantity; better to have 1-2 clear, specific offerings than many vague ones.

#### Deep Facilitation: Getting to Real Needs & Offerings

**Creating the Right Environment:**
- Start with vulnerability: facilitators share their own needs/offerings first
- Use the circle formation where everyone can see each other
- Encourage authentic sharing over polite performance

**Questions to Reveal Real Needs:**
1. The Cash Crunch Story: "Tell me about the last time you needed something but money was tight. What did you do?"
2. The Dream Resource: "If you could access any service in the neighborhood without money, what would be the first three things?"
3. The Hidden Embarrassment: "What's something you need but feel awkward asking for?"
4. The Ripple Effect: "If you had reliable access to [service], what else would that free you up to do?"

**Questions to Reveal Real Offerings:**
1. The Underground Skills: "What do people always ask you for help with?"
2. The Joy Principle: "What work energizes you rather than drains you?"
3. The Abundance Question: "What do you have too much of? What resources do you wish didn't go to waste?"
4. The Teaching Spark: "What could you teach someone in an afternoon?"

**Trust-Building Patterns:**
- Use stories, not lists ("Let me tell you about when I traded tutoring for plumbing...")
- Address fear directly ("What worries you about bartering/exchanging?")
- Build on natural reciprocity ("Who in this room have you already helped?")

**The "Magic Soup" Moment:**
1. Start with one person's offer
2. Show how others could add to it
3. Watch the "aha" moment when people see the multiplier effect

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
- Offers that feel performative rather than authentic
- Needs that seem too polite or safe
- Exchanges that maintain power imbalances

The goal is to move from polite offers → things they'd genuinely enjoy sharing, and from safe needs → actual vulnerabilities.

### Break & Matching (7:20-7:40 PM)
- Participants enjoy refreshments while the facilitation team acts as "human librarians" quickly reviewing the commitment cards and identifying potential matches or conversation clusters.
- Commitment cards are organized on a wall or board into thematic areas.
- **Materials needed**: Refreshments, push pins or tape, categorization signs
- **Facilitation note**: Have designated "guides" available during the break to answer individual questions about the system.

### Conversation Space 1 (7:40-8:00 PM)
- Participants are directed to conversation clusters based on complementary needs/offers or thematic areas.
- Facilitated discussion using prompts like:
  - What specific skills or resources do you have within this area?
  - What would make exchanging these easier or more valuable?
  - What support might you need to fully offer this?
- **Materials needed**: Conversation prompt cards, note-taking materials
- **Facilitation note**: Ensure each small group has a facilitator or experienced community member to guide discussion.

### Conversation Space 2 (8:00-8:30 PM)
- Participants move to a second conversation cluster based on another interest area.
- During this session, participants are encouraged to identify at least one concrete exchange they might be interested in pursuing.
- **Materials needed**: Small "Potential Exchange" forms to record specific connections
- **Facilitation note**: Create deliberate movement between groups to maximize new connections.

### Reflection (8:30-8:40 PM)
- Individual journaling or paired sharing about:
  - What surprised me about tonight
  - One offering I'm excited to contribute
  - One need I'm curious to fulfill
  - Questions I still have
- **Materials needed**: Journal pages or reflection sheets, pens
- **Facilitation note**: Create a quiet, contemplative space for this activity.

### Next Steps (8:40-8:50 PM)
- **System Launch Timeline** (3 min): Brief overview of upcoming implementation phases.
- **Concrete Participation Options** (7 min):
  - Sign-up for the initial member cohort
  - Next Connection Circle date
  - How to finalize commitments
  - Communication channels and support resources
- **Materials needed**: Sign-up sheets, calendar of upcoming events, handouts with key information
- **Facilitation note**: Make the path to continued participation clear and simple.

### Closing Circle (8:50-9:00 PM)

- Acknowledgments and appreciations
- Final announcement of immediate next steps

## Alignment with Community Exchange Documentation

This launch event integrates key elements from:

1. **F.01 Connection Circles**: Using prompts to spark meaningful conversation and identify potential exchanges
2. **F.05 New Member Orientation**: Providing system overview and support for creating initial commitments
3. **C.01 Onboarding Process**: Establishing the cohort-based approach to welcoming new members

Rather than separating orientation and connection activities, this launch event combines them into a cohesive introduction to the Community Connection & Commitment Commons. This approach acknowledges that for our initial phase, it makes sense to onboard members as a cohort rather than through rolling individual orientations.
