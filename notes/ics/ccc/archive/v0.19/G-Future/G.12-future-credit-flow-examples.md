# Future Credit Flow Examples

This document contains examples of potential future implementations of the Community Exchange credit flow system. These examples represent possibilities for expanding the system once the initial phase is well-established.

## Example 1: Community Event Participation (ICS Integration)

**Scenario**: The community organizes a Repair Café event where several members contribute.

**Credit Flow**:
1. ICS organizes a Repair Café event
2. Five members volunteer their time and repair skills:
   - Carlos (electrical repairs): 3 hours = 3 credits
   - Lisa (clothing mending): 3 hours = 3 credits
   - Jamal (bike repairs): 3 hours = 3 credits
   - Priya (toy repairs): 3 hours = 3 credits
   - Wei (furniture repairs): 3 hours = 3 credits
3. Each volunteer earns credits for their contribution
4. ICS, as the event organizer, issues the credits (total of 15 credits) to recognize the community service

**Key Learning**: Group activities and community service can be recognized through the credit system, with organizing entities (like ICS) issuing credits to recognize volunteer contributions.

## Example 2: Resource Sharing Network

**Scenario**: A tool-sharing network develops among neighbors.

**Credit Flow**:
1. Hassan adds "Pressure washer lending - 2 credits per day" to the pool
2. Maya borrows the pressure washer for a day (-2 credits)
3. Maya later adds "Stand mixer lending - 1 credit per use" to the pool
4. Sophia borrows Maya's stand mixer (-1 credit to Sophia, +1 to Maya)
5. Sophia offers "Camping tent lending - 3 credits per weekend"
6. Hassan borrows Sophia's tent for a weekend (-3 credits to Hassan, +3 to Sophia)

**Result**:
- Hassan: +2 credits (pressure washer) -3 credits (tent) = -1 net
- Maya: -2 credits (pressure washer) +1 credit (stand mixer) = -1 net
- Sophia: -1 credit (stand mixer) +3 credits (tent) = +2 net

**Key Learning**: A lending network creates ongoing relationships and multiple transactions over time. Not everyone's balance is zero at any given moment, but the system enables resource sharing without each person needing to own every tool.
