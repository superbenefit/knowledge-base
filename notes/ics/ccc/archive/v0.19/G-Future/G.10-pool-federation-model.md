# Pool Ecosystem Model

## Overview
Community Connection & Commitment Commons uses an ecosystem architecture where independent pools choose their ecosystem partners, creating a flexible economic network.

## Ecosystem Types

### Open Ecosystem
- Accepts transactions from any other pool
- Example: Local grocery stores pool

### Selective Ecosystem  
- Defines which pools to connect with
- Example: Artists pool exchanging only with food & tech

### Closed Pools
- Internal transactions only
- Example: Childcare co-op

### Partially Open
- Different exchange rates for different pools
- Example: 1:1 with neighborhoods, 1:0.8 with sector pools

## Fractal Scaling

### Multi-Layer Architecture
- Bridge tokens ($BREAD ?) can connect entire networks
- Regional tokens ($MAPLE ?) can span multiple localities  
- Local pools maintain autonomy
- Sub-pools enable fine-grained community organization

### Emergence Support
- Systems designed for organic growth
- No predetermined geographic boundaries
- Names and structure follow actual usage patterns

## Implementation Notes
- Federation requires mutual agreement between pools
- Exchange rates determined by local governance
- Technical protocols enable interoperability
- Communities maintain sovereignty within federation
