## Operational Model

### Credit Valuation
- Steward circle determines value for different contributions
- All valuations are transparently shared with community
- Community members can question and discuss valuations
- 1 credit = $10 USD equivalent

### Value Creation Cycle
1. Participants commit to 5 credits per quarterly event
2. Credits are fulfilled through cash or service contributions  
3. Cash contributions help seed the pool for mandatory expenses
4. Services and materials are provided to reduce cash needs
5. Events create value through experiences and connections
6. Credits may carry over or be used across events

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Pilot Integration (Next Event)
- Integrate credits for volunteer roles
- Create credit-based attendance options
- Track credit flow and satisfaction

### Phase 2: Full Economy Model (Following Event)
- Expand credit usage to all event aspects
- Create pre-event preparation credits
- Develop post-event community credits

### Phase 3: Network Scaling (Multiple Events)
- Connect different events through credit system
- Build traveling credit-aware community
- Document and share successful models
