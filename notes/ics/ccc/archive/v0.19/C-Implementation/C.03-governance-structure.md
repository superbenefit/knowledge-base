# Community Exchange: Governance Structure

This document outlines how decisions are made, who makes them, and the responsibilities of various roles within the Community Exchange system. The governance structure is designed to evolve as the system grows, starting with a lightweight approach for the pilot phase and evolving toward greater decentralization over time.

## Core Principles of Governance

The Community Exchange is governed according to these principles:

1. **Distributed Leadership**: Authority and responsibility are shared rather than concentrated, with power distributed across the community
2. **Consent-Based Decision Making**: We seek consent (absence of objections) rather than consensus (everyone agrees)
3. **Transparency**: Decision-making processes and records are visible to all members
4. **Subsidiarity**: Decisions are made at the most local level possible by those most affected
5. **Continuous Learning**: Governance evolves based on experience and feedback
6. **Service**: Leadership positions are viewed as service to the community, not ownership or control
7. **Autonomy**: Individuals and groups have freedom to act within agreed boundaries
8. **Nested Circles**: Groups can form at multiple scales (collaboration, coordination, constituency) as needed

## Pilot Phase Governance

During the initial pilot phase, governance will remain lightweight while establishing the foundation for more distributed systems as the community grows.

### Organizational Structure

The Community Exchange operates as a network that coordinates through shared protocols:

1. **Stewardship Circle** (3-5 members initially)
   - Maintains the core infrastructure and processes
   - Facilitates overall coordination and communication
   - Ensures alignment with community values and purpose
   - Enables the formation of Working Groups

2. **Working Groups** (form based on needs)
   - Self-organizing groups focused on specific functions
   - Operate with autonomy within their defined domains
   - Connect back to the Stewardship Circle for coordination
   - Can form, evolve, or dissolve as needed

### Stewardship Circle

#### Composition
- Initially 3-5 founding members
- Eventually 5-10 members representing diverse perspectives and skills

#### Selection Process
- Initial stewards are founding members who volunteer
- Future stewards are nominated by existing stewards or community members
- Selection based on:
  - Demonstrated commitment to community values
  - Active participation in the system
  - Complementary skills and perspectives
  - Willingness to serve

#### Term
- No fixed term limits
- Quarterly check-in on capacity and commitment
- Annual renewal of intent to serve
- Stewards can step down at any time with notice

#### Responsibilities
1. **System Maintenance**:
   - Managing the ledger system
   - Tracking credits and exchanges
   - Ensuring system integrity
   - Monitoring system health

2. **Member Support**:
   - Onboarding new members
   - Supporting members in using the system
   - Facilitating connections between members
   - Addressing questions and concerns

3. **Community Building**:
   - Organizing Connection Circle gatherings
   - Facilitating community celebrations
   - Ensuring inclusive participation
   - Maintaining communication channels

4. **Decision Making**:
   - Developing and refining policies
   - Addressing conflicts and challenges
   - Evolving the system based on experience
   - Making day-to-day operational decisions

5. **External Relations**:
   - Representing the system to other communities
   - Connecting with allied initiatives
   - Sharing learnings and best practices
   - Exploring partnerships and collaborations

#### Meeting Rhythm
- Weekly operational check-ins (30 minutes)
- Monthly strategic sessions (2 hours)
- Quarterly retrospectives and planning (half-day)
- Annual vision and review session (full day)

#### Decision-Making Process
1. **Proposal**: Any steward can bring a proposal to the circle
2. **Clarifying Questions**: Understanding the proposal fully
3. **Reactions**: Brief, non-binding reactions to the proposal
4. **Amendments**: The proposer may amend based on reactions
5. **Objections**: Stewards raise objections if the proposal would cause harm
6. **Integration**: Working through objections to improve the proposal
7. **Consent**: When no objections remain, the proposal is adopted

### Documentation
- All stewardship circle meetings are documented
- Decision records are maintained and visible to all members
- Policy changes are communicated proactively to the community

### Working Groups

For specific projects or ongoing operational needs, the Stewardship Circle may establish Working Groups.

#### Formation Process
1. Stewardship Circle identifies need for a Working Group
2. Call for participants goes out to all members
3. Interested members join (no approval needed for participation)
4. Group establishes its own rhythm and process
5. Regular reports back to Stewardship Circle

#### Authority
- Working Groups have autonomy within their domain
- Major decisions or changes come back to Stewardship Circle for consent
- Working Groups are temporary unless established as ongoing

#### Example Working Groups
- Technology Implementation
- New Member Onboarding
- Community Events
- Conflict Resolution
- External Communications

## All-Member Governance

Certain decisions require input from all members:

### Decision Categories
1. **Major System Changes**:
   - Significant changes to credit policies
   - Technology platform changes
   - Fundamental purpose or direction shifts

2. **Stewardship Selection**:
   - Affirming new stewards
   - Addressing concerns about current stewards

3. **Community Vision**:
   - Annual direction setting
   - Long-term planning

### Process for All-Member Decisions
1. Proposal development (by Stewardship Circle or Working Group)
2. Written proposal shared with all members
3. Discussion period (in-person or online)
4. Gathering feedback and concerns
5. Proposal refinement
6. Final decision by consent (absence of significant objections)

### Meeting Structure
- Quarterly all-member gatherings
- Special assemblies for urgent matters
- Online options for those who cannot attend in person
- Facilitated by stewards or designated facilitators

## System Roles and Responsibilities

The Community Exchange requires various functions to operate effectively. Rather than assigning fixed roles to specific individuals, the Stewardship Circle will collectively ensure these responsibilities are met through self-organization and emergent patterns.

### Key System Functions

These functions represent areas of responsibility that need attention, but how they are distributed and managed will emerge organically based on stewards' capacities, interests, and the needs of the community:

#### System Maintenance
- Managing the ledger system
- Tracking credits and exchanges
- Ensuring system integrity
- Monitoring system health

#### Community Support
- Welcoming and onboarding new members
- Supporting members in using the system
- Facilitating connections between members
- Addressing questions and concerns

#### Community Building
- Organizing Connection Circle gatherings
- Facilitating community celebrations
- Ensuring inclusive participation
- Maintaining communication channels

#### Learning and Documentation
- Documenting patterns and practices
- Gathering and integrating feedback
- Proposing system improvements
- Sharing knowledge with other communities

#### External Connections
- Representing the community to outside groups
- Exploring beneficial partnerships
- Connecting with allied initiatives
- Bringing external innovations into the community

The Stewardship Circle will regularly reflect on how these functions are being fulfilled and adapt their approach as needed, ensuring all necessary work is covered without creating rigid role assignments.

### Member Responsibilities

All members share these governance responsibilities:

1. Participate in quarterly all-member gatherings
2. Provide feedback on system functioning
3. Vote on major decisions when required
4. Consider serving in Working Groups or the Stewardship Circle
5. Uphold community agreements and values

## Delegation and Distributed Authority

The governance system supports the delegation of authority while maintaining accountability:

1. **Clear Domains**: Each Working Group and role has a clearly defined domain of authority
2. **Decision Rights**: Explicit rights to make decisions within those domains
3. **Transparency**: All delegated authority is documented and visible
4. **Accountability**: Regular reporting on decisions and outcomes
5. **Revocation Process**: Clear process for addressing misuse of authority

## Conflict Resolution

See separate "Conflict Resolution Process" document for detailed procedures.

### Key Principles
- Address conflicts early and directly
- Focus on needs and system improvement, not blame
- Use graduated approach for resolution
- Document outcomes and learnings
- Use conflicts as opportunities to improve the system

## Compensation

- Stewards may receive credits for their service (e.g., 2 credits/month)
- Working Group members may receive credits for substantial contributions
- All compensation is transparent and recorded in the ledger

## Evolution of Governance

This governance structure will evolve as the community grows and learns. The Stewardship Circle will facilitate a formal review of governance:
- After the first 3 months of operation
- At the 6-month mark
- Annually thereafter
