# Impact Yield Fund Meeting Notes

This document compiles all discussions related to the Impact Yield Fund across five meetings in chronological order.

---

## 1. SuperBenefit GC Call – 24 March 2025

**Key Points Discussed:**

* The group had been developing a DeFi-based yield fund structure designed to generate low-risk returns, with the yield directed toward impact initiatives.
* Inspiration came from conversations with Brian (Bowen) and models like Breadchain.
* One concern raised was: why would investors need this intermediary instead of directly accessing DeFi returns themselves?
* Heenal expressed doubts about continued momentum, but saw the appeal of this model for SuperBenefit to cover operational costs and explore local implementation in Ontario.
* Filsan highlighted the potential of community-governed impact funding, independent of investor preferences.
* Lewwwk clarified that the value proposition targets the investment side of endowments, not the grant-making side. It's pitched as a low-risk Treasury allocation with impact as a bonus.
* Rather pointed out a lack of discussion on the *impact* itself—he emphasized that we should define what specific impacts the fund aims to deliver.
* Discussion included possibly focusing on environmental on-chain impact metrics (e.g. hypercerts, karma GAP) to build credibility.
* Michelle proposed a "structure-first" cell to design the model and return to Bowen with a clearer proposal.
* Heenal suggested exploring a local, regenerative-focused community fund in London, Ontario.
* Tension identified between institutional-led models (like Verge) and truly community-owned structures.
* Final outcomes:

  * Agreed to create a working cell
  * Need to define a theory of change and impact thesis before returning to Bowen
  * Desire to avoid designing *only* for Bowen's interest; fund should be generalisable
  * Recognized need for clearer articulation of impact, and potential to integrate commitment pooling later.

## 2. Reimagining Power Core Team Call – 10 April 2025

**Key Points Discussed:**

* The team revisited the status of the yield fund and confirmed previous discussions to form a dedicated cell.
* Filsan noted that a past meeting (with Michael) included consensus around creating a structure-focused working group.
* The group recognized that momentum had stalled and that forward movement would require someone stepping up to lead it.
* There was reflection on emergent leadership within decentralized organizations and the idea that energy and commitment—not consensus—should guide initiative.
* No decision was made in this meeting, but participants acknowledged that a champion was needed to push the next phase forward.

## 3. Michelle Baldwin & Brian Smith – Web3 and Impact Investing Call

**Key Points Discussed:**

* Brian reiterated Bowen's openness to novel structures, including the yield fund idea.
* Michelle and Brian acknowledged the challenge of risk-averse boards and investment committees.
* Brian suggested any pitch must have a clear *impact thesis* and must demonstrate that the yield fund model is at least as good as traditional financial instruments.
* The fund needs a defined path to impact and clarity on how Web3 tools (like attestations, hypercerts) will be leveraged.
* Emphasis on the importance of *storytelling* and *trust-building* when pitching unconventional models.

## 4. Heenal Rajani – 30 Minutes Meeting

**Key Points Discussed:**

* The yield fund concept was described in context of evolving experiments with SuperBenefit and ICS.
* Heenal explained the goal: to create a fund where capital is preserved, a fixed yield is provided to investors (e.g. 5–6%), and excess yield is directed to impact projects.
* These projects could be selected based on investor interest or by theme, and outcomes would be tracked using impact attestations on-chain.
* The fund builds on earlier concepts like creating a social-good version of OlympusDAO—a yield-generating primitive for regenerative initiatives.
* Heenal described this as aligned with reimagining power by decentralizing ownership and enabling regenerative coordination infrastructure.

## 5. GreenPill London @ Saga – 23 April 2025

(No relevant discussion of the yield fund was found in this call's transcript. Focus was on local regenerative experiments, tooling, and coordination.)

## Summary of Next Steps and Action Items

* Define the *theory of change* and impact areas: this is a key expectation from Bowen and essential for pitching.
* Develop a shared document with impact areas for comment and prioritisation.
* Clarify how this model differs from or complements existing regional funds (e.g. Verge).
* Possibly pilot the model locally with a focus on regenerative economy or habitat restoration.
* Consider integrating the fund into a broader commitment pooling system.
* Form a dedicated working group (or "cell") to finalise structure and outreach strategy.
