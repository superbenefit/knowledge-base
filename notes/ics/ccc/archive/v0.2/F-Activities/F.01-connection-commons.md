# Connection Commons Program

## Purpose
The Connection Commons program aims to build relationships, identify needs and offerings, spark new exchanges, and strengthen the community fabric. This program primarily operates through its main activity: the Belonging Circle.

## The Belonging Circle

### Format
- 2-hour gathering (in-person or hybrid)
- Opening: Welcome and brief system updates
- Main activity: Facilitated sharing based on thoughtful prompts
- Small group conversations around potential exchanges
- Closing: Identify concrete next steps for exchanges

### Frequency
Monthly

### Credit Earning
Facilitators earn 2 credits

## Relationship to Onboarding

The Connection Commons works in conjunction with the cohort-based New Member Orientation:

- New member cohorts attend orientation events that incorporate connection activities
- After orientation, they join regular Belonging Circle gatherings as full community members
- Experienced members use Belonging Circles to welcome newcomers and expand their exchange network
- Stewards monitor participation to ensure new members are successfully integrating

## Implementation Notes

### Facilitation Tips for Belonging Circles
- Use a talking piece to ensure equal speaking time
- Create a welcoming environment with comfortable seating arranged in a circle
- Provide simple refreshments (can be offered for credit)
- Use name tags if the group includes newer members
- Balance structure with organic conversation
- Consider a check-in/check-out format

### Prompts That Work Well
- "What's something you've been learning recently?"
- "What's a skill you'd like to develop?"
- "Share a time when someone in your community helped you."
- "What's something you enjoy doing that others might find valuable?"
- "What's a challenge you're facing that others might help with?"
- "What's an abundance in your life right now that you might share?"
- "What season-specific needs do you anticipate in the coming months?"

- Online connection opportunities
- Documenting and sharing success stories from exchanges

## Evolution Over Time

As the Community Connection & Commitment Commons matures:

- Facilitation could rotate among experienced members
- Documentation of patterns and learnings becomes more systematic
