## Notes on Naming

### Project Naming Decisions
- "Community Connection & Commitment Commons" establishes clear focus on both connection and reciprocal commitment
- "C4" or "4C" can be used as abbreviations when appropriate
- "Commons" language used for programs/systems to ground in community ownership concept
- "Circle" language used for events/gatherings to emphasize the relational nature
- "Commitment Voucher" is the formal term for the exchange unit, often abbreviated to simply "Voucher" in common usage
- "Pool" refers to the shared resource space within the Commitment Commons
- "Ecosystem" describes the federation of connected pools that can form across communities

### Commons vs Circle Resolution
- **Commons**: Used for ongoing programs and systems
- **Circle/Convergence/Celebration**: Used for specific events/gatherings

### Removed Terminology
- "SIPs" terminology has been replaced with "Connection Commons"
- "Connection Circles" now refers only to events within the Connection Commons program
- "Credit" has been replaced with "Commitment Voucher" / "Voucher"
