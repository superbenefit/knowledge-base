# Reimagine Co Meal Vouchers System

## Overview

Reimagine Co, a plant-based meal service, demonstrates how businesses can create value and liquidity in the Community Connection & Commitment Commons while building customer loyalty and community support. This model shows how businesses can participate in the community economy while maintaining profitability.

## How It Works

### Basic Structure
- **Voucher Value:** 1 voucher = $10 = 30 mins "normal" work
- **Meal Pricing:** Each meal = 1 voucher (equivalent to $10 retail price)
- **Business Capacity:** Reimagine can commit up to 100 meals to the pool

### Economic Mechanics

**1. Adding Liquidity:**
- Reimagine commits 100 meals (100 vouchers = $1000 value) to the pool
- This creates immediate valuable inventory people want
- Act as a "liquidity provider" in the Community Connection & Commitment Commons

**2. Cash Redemption Structure:**
- Business cash-out: 30% fee (receive $7 per voucher)
- Individual emergency cash access: No fee
- Cash stays in pool, adding liquidity when businesses cash out

**3. Benefits for Reimagine:**
- Guaranteed customer base
- Community goodwill and loyalty
- Access to cash when needed (at 70% value)
- No need to find exact reciprocal services worth $1000

### Liquidity Management

**Cash Entry Sources:**
- Optional joining fees for individuals
- Business joining/monthly fees
- Grants and sponsorships
- Donations
- Hybrid organizational support (like ICS)

**Cash Reserve Policies:**
- All cash-outs subject to steward approval
- Reserve policies set as community needs arise
- Flexible approach to maintain healthy liquidity

### Emergency Access Policy

**Individual Need Access:**
- Honor system to start
- Steward oversight
- No 30% fee for individuals in documented need
- Community trust-based verification
