# Finding Your Community's Common Purpose

## Why Common Purpose Matters

Community Exchange pools work best when participants share a common purpose or goal. Without this unifying thread, the system risks becoming a "nice idea" rather than a "must-have." A clear shared purpose transforms curiosity into commitment and creates the energy needed for sustained participation.

> **"Commitment pools work best when there's a common purpose/goal/interest that binds the group together and makes participation essential rather than optional."**

## Different Groups, Different Purposes

### Pilot Group: Resilience During Cash Crunches
**Shared Challenge**: When the money stops flowing, life doesn't
**Common Purpose**: Creating a reliable safety net of goods and services during lean times
**Key Questions**: 
- When was the last time you needed something but money was tight?
- What if you could access essential services without waiting for payday?

### Neighborhood Groups: Local Resilience
**Shared Challenge**: Building a community that can support its own needs
**Common Purpose**: Creating a local safety net that reduces dependency on outside systems
**Key Questions**:
- What would make our neighborhood more self-reliant?
- How can we reduce vulnerability to outside economic shocks?

### Artist Communities: Sustaining Creative Practice
**Shared Challenge**: Making art while making a living
**Common Purpose**: Building a sustainable ecosystem for creative practice
**Key Questions**:
- How can we resource our art without compromising our vision?
- What shared resources would free us to create more fully?

### Journey Land: Co-creating Experiences
**Shared Challenge**: Creating events that enrich everyone involved
**Common Purpose**: Building events together that are greater than any individual could create
**Key Questions**:
- What experiences do we dream of creating together?
- How can shared skills make our events extraordinary?

## Facilitating Purpose Discovery

### Phase 1: Surfacing Pain Points and Dreams

**Start with Recognition**
- "Everyone here has wealth—skills, time, space, knowledge"
- "We all also have gaps—things we need but can't easily access"

**Use Story to Surface Needs**
1. The Cash Crunch Story: "Tell about a time money was tight but life didn't stop demanding things from you"
2. The Dream State: "Imagine you could access any skill or resource in your community without money—what changes?"
3. The Hidden Struggle: "What do you need but feel awkward asking for?"

**Identify the Common Thread**
- Listen for shared frustrations
- Notice recurring themes
- Highlight mutual dependencies

### Phase 2: Naming the Purpose

**Move from Problems to Purpose**
- "We all struggle with X, but together we can..."
- "What if this group could guarantee each other Y?"

**Test for Urgency**
- "How would having this change your life in the next month?"
- "What would it mean to you personally?"
- "What's at stake if we don't do this together?"

**Frame as Transformation**
- From: Individual scarcity → Collective abundance
- From: Isolated struggle → Mutual support
- From: Resource hoarding → Resource circulation

### Phase 3: Making It Concrete

**Create a Purpose Statement**
- Clear: What exactly are we doing together?
- Urgent: Why does this matter now?
- Personal: How does this serve each member?
- Collective: How do we create this together?

Example formats:
- "We pool our skills to ensure no one goes without [essential need] during [challenging time]"
- "Together, we guarantee each other access to [resources] regardless of cash flow"
- "We create a community where [value] circulates freely among us"

### Phase 4: Building From Purpose

**Design Flows from Purpose**
- What exchanges directly serve this purpose?
- Who needs to be involved?
- What rules support this purpose?
- How do we measure success?

**Connect Purpose to Action**
- First exchanges should exemplify the purpose
- Each member should see immediate relevance
- The system should remind people of the purpose

## Warning Signs

### Weak Purpose Indicators
- People say "it's nice" but don't act
- Participation feels like obligation
- No urgency to make exchanges
- Offers feel performative

### Strong Purpose Indicators
- Members show up consistently
- People ask "can the pool help with this?"
- Exchanges feel essential, not extra
- New members understand immediately why it matters

## Evolving Purpose

### As Groups Grow
- Check: Is our purpose still serving everyone?
- Expand: What new needs have emerged?
- Strengthen: How can we deepen our commitment?

### As Situations Change
- Respond: How does crisis/abundance shift our purpose?
- Adapt: What new forms of support are needed?
- Remember: Core purpose often remains, expressions change

## Example Purpose Journeys

### From Curiosity to Commitment
1. Initial: "Exchange skills sounds interesting"
2. Discovered purpose: "We need dependable access to services during seasonal income gaps"
3. Result: "I show up because I know others are counting on my offerings when they're in need"

### From Individual to Collective
1. Initial: "I want to get my car fixed cheaper"
2. Discovered purpose: "Our neighborhood can meet more needs locally"
3. Result: "I offer freely because I trust the collective ensures my needs are met"

## Practical Application

When facilitating purpose discovery:

1. **Create safety** before vulnerability
2. **Use stories** more than lists
3. **Find the real needs** behind polite requests
4. **Name the collective** possibility
5. **Make participation** clearly valuable
6. **Connect immediately** to action

Remember: A clear common purpose transforms Community Exchange from an experiment people try to a system people depend on.
