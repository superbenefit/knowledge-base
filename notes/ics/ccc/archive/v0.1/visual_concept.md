# Community Exchange: Visual Concept

*Note: This document serves as a placeholder for visual diagrams that will be developed. The text below describes what these visuals will illustrate.*

## Core System Diagram (to be created)

The primary visual will illustrate the relationship between Connection Circles and the Commitment Pool, showing:

1. **Connection Circles** (left side)
   - Represented as gathering spaces where people connect
   - Speech bubbles showing "I can teach..." and "I want to learn..."
   - Arrows showing how these connections lead to commitments

2. **Commitment Pool** (center)
   - Visualized as a shared commons or pool
   - Shows various commitments being added (e.g., skills, goods, services)
   - Credits flowing between members and the pool

3. **Community Benefits** (right side)
   - Illustrates outcomes: stronger relationships, resilience, resource sharing
   - Shows how individual needs are met through the system

## Credit Flow Diagram (to be created)

This diagram will show the lifecycle of credits:

1. Member A offers a commitment to the pool
2. Member B redeems that commitment
3. Member A receives credits
4. Member A uses credits to receive something from Member C
5. The cycle continues, showing how value circulates

## Community Growth Model (to be created)

This visualization will illustrate how the system grows:

1. Initial core group of founding members
2. Each member invites 2 new members after 3 months
3. New community circles form in different neighborhoods
4. Bridges between circles allow for cross-community exchange

## Technology Transition Timeline (to be created)

This will show our planned technology evolution:

1. Phase 1: Google Sheets tracking system
2. Phase 2: Training and transition period
3. Phase 3: Full implementation of Sarafu.Network

## Credit Balance Visualization (to be created)

This will illustrate:
- How credit limits work (-10 to +10)
- The flow of credits through the system
- How expiration encourages circulation

*Note to designers: These visuals should use a consistent color scheme and style, emphasizing community, connection, and abundance rather than scarcity. Consider using circular designs to emphasize the cyclical, regenerative nature of the system.*
