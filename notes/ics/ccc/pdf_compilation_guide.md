1. **Pandoc**: A universal document converter
   - Install from [https://pandoc.org/installing.html](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)

2. **LaTeX**: For high-quality PDF output
   - Windows: Install MiKTeX [https://miktex.org/download](https://miktex.org/download)

   - Linux: Install TeX Live `sudo apt-get install texlive-full`

3. **Visual Assets**:
   - Any logo or images to include
   - Placeholder for diagrams that will be added later

## Compilation Methods

### Simple Method (Basic PDF)

Use this Pandoc command to quickly compile all files into a basic PDF:

```bash
cd /Users/heenal/Documents/GitHub/knowledge-base/notes/ics/ccc
pandoc pdf_cover.md table_of_contents.md community_exchange_overview.md visual_concept.md principles_and_values.md glossary.md faq.md onboarding_process.md technology_implementation.md implementation_timeline.md governance_structure.md risks_and_mitigation.md commitment_examples.md credit_flow_examples.md testimonial_scenarios.md community_activities.md how_to_guides.md success_metrics.md scaling_strategy.md future_possibilities.md conflict_resolution.md appendix_resources.md -o community_exchange.pdf
```

### Professional Method (Styled PDF)

For a more professional PDF with proper styling:

1. Create a YAML metadata file named `metadata.yaml`:

```yaml
---
title: "Community Exchange: Connecting Curiosity and Commitment in London"
author: "Institute for Community Sustainability"
date: "April 2025"
toc: true
toc-depth: 2
numbersections: true
papersize: letter
documentclass: report
geometry: margin=1in
links-as-notes: true
colorlinks: true
linkcolor: blue
---
```

2. Use this enhanced Pandoc command:

```bash
cd /Users/heenal/Documents/GitHub/knowledge-base/notes/ics/ccc
pandoc metadata.yaml pdf_cover.md table_of_contents.md community_exchange_overview.md visual_concept.md principles_and_values.md glossary.md faq.md onboarding_process.md technology_implementation.md implementation_timeline.md governance_structure.md risks_and_mitigation.md commitment_examples.md credit_flow_examples.md testimonial_scenarios.md community_activities.md how_to_guides.md success_metrics.md scaling_strategy.md future_possibilities.md conflict_resolution.md appendix_resources.md -o community_exchange_professional.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex
```

## HTML Version Option

To create an HTML version (which can be useful for online sharing):

```bash
cd /Users/heenal/Documents/GitHub/knowledge-base/notes/ics/ccc
pandoc metadata.yaml pdf_cover.md table_of_contents.md community_exchange_overview.md visual_concept.md principles_and_values.md glossary.md faq.md onboarding_process.md technology_implementation.md implementation_timeline.md governance_structure.md risks_and_mitigation.md commitment_examples.md credit_flow_examples.md testimonial_scenarios.md community_activities.md how_to_guides.md success_metrics.md scaling_strategy.md future_possibilities.md conflict_resolution.md appendix_resources.md -o community_exchange.html --css=style.css --self-contained
```
