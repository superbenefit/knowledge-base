# Community Connection & Commitment Commons: Terminology Update Tracker

This document tracks the progress of updating terminology across the project documentation as we transition from "Community Exchange" to "Community Connection & Commitment Commons" and related terminology changes.

## Key Terminology Changes

| Old Term | New Term | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Community Exchange | Community Connection & Commitment Commons | In progress |
| CCC | C4 | In progress |
| Connection Circles (program) | Connection Commons | In progress |
| Connection Circles (event) | Belonging Circle | In progress |
| Monthly Gathering | Belonging Circle | In progress |
| Commitment Pool | Commitment Commons | In progress |
| Welcome Circle/Soup Circle | Belonging Commons | In progress |
| Credit | Commitment Voucher (formal), Voucher (common) | Agreed |
| Pool | Pool | Agreed |
| Federation | Ecosystem | Agreed |
| SIPs | Removed (replaced by Connection Commons) | In progress |

## Commons vs Circle Clarification

We've now established a clear distinction:
- "Commons" refers to programs/systems (the ongoing structures)
- "Circle" refers to activities/gatherings (the actual events)

This creates the structure:

**Programs (Commons):**
- Belonging Commons
- Connection Commons 
- Commitment Commons

**Events (Circles/Gatherings):**
- Belonging Circle (the Monthly Gathering)
- Quarterly Convergence
- Annual Celebration

**Exchange Unit:**
- Commitment Voucher (formal name)
- Voucher (common usage)

**Resource Spaces:**
- Pool (shared resource space)
- Ecosystem (federation of connected pools)

## Remaining Tasks

1. Conduct a comprehensive search and replace across all documentation for:
   - "Community Exchange" → "Community Connection & Commitment Commons"
   - Program terminology:
     - "Connection Circles" (as program) → "Connection Commons"
     - "Commitment Pool" → "Commitment Commons"
     - "Welcome Circle/Soup Circle" (as program) → "Belonging Commons"
   - Event terminology:
     - "Monthly Gathering" → "Belonging Circle"
     - "Connection Circles" (as event) → "Belonging Circle"
   - Exchange unit terminology:
     - "Credit" → "Commitment Voucher" (formal) or "Voucher" (common)
   - Network terminology:
     - "Federation" → "Ecosystem"
   - Abbreviations:
     - "CCC" (when referring to the project) → "C4"
     - "SIPs" → Remove or replace with "Connection Commons"
   
2. Check all remaining files in the following directories:
   - A-Cover
   - C-Implementation
   - D-Examples (remaining files)
   - E-Guides (remaining files)
   - F-Activities (remaining files)
   - G-Future
   - H-Reference (remaining files)
   
3. Update any cross-references within the files to ensure they point to the correct file names

## How to Proceed

1. Use search functionality to find occurrences of old terminology
2. For each file, update the content to use the new terminology with the Commons/Circle distinction
3. Update all references to credits to use "Commitment Voucher" or "Voucher" as appropriate
4. Test all links and cross-references to ensure they still work
