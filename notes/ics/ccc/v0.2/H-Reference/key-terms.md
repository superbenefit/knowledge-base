## Notes on Naming

### Main Project Name
Currently "Community Exchange" feels transactional and uninspiring. Need something that captures:
- The living, organic nature of the system
- Connection and interdependence
- Local roots with global vision

**Strong contenders**:
- **Interweave**: Captures the interlocking nature, feels like a living system
- **Kindred Commons**: Suggests kinship, shared space
- **Living Commons**: Emphasizes organic, evolving nature
- **Commons Web**: Network of interconnected community spaces

### Circle/Commons Transitions
When thinking about the expanded ecosystem:
- Movement between spaces as "thresholds" or "passages"
- Each commons as a distinct but connected space
- Natural flow rather than rigid boundaries

### Credit/Exchange Unit Alternatives
- **Voucher**: More familiar, less financial
- **Community Note**: Personal, relational
- **Exchange Unit**: Neutral, descriptive
- **Token**: Digital-friendly
- **Promise**: Emphasizes relational aspect

### Pool/Network Alternatives
- **Commons**: Traditional, community-focused
- **Wellspring**: Evokes natural abundance
- **Network/Web**: Emphasizes connections
- **Ecosystem**: Emphasizes living system
- **Constellation**: Beautiful, interconnected

## Questions to Address
- What does SIPs stand for and how does it fit?
- Which metaphor feels most authentic - natural (web, ecosystem) or traditional (commons, wellspring)?
- Should we maintain the "circle" terminology or shift to "commons" throughout?
- How do we balance familiarity with inspiration in naming?

## Action Items
- [ ] Define SIPs and integrate into framework
- [ ] Finalize main project name
- [ ] Decide on circle vs commons terminology
- [ ] Choose exchange unit name (credit/voucher/etc.)
- [ ] Test names with pilot participants
- [ ] Ensure consistency across all materials
