# Critical Analysis of CCC Implementation Strategy

This document synthesizes key insights and critical feedback following our discussion with Scott Morris, an expert in community currency implementation. It aims to identify opportunities to strengthen our Community Connection & Commitment Commons strategy based on practical experience and lessons from previous implementations.

## 1. Naming, Framing & Psychology

**Insights from Scott:**
- "This is real spellcasting territory, so be real careful how you name things."
- The Ithaca Hours name created confusion by requiring mental math (1 hour = $10).
- Simpler, less intimidating language like "points" can work better than "currency" or "dollars."

**Issues in Current Plan:**
- "Commitment Commons" and "Commitment Vouchers" sound somewhat formal and contractual, potentially intimidating new users.
- The "Credits" terminology ties directly to monetary value, reinforcing the perception of an alternative currency rather than a collaborative system.

**Recommendations:**
- Consider more emotionally resonant terminology: "Community Shares," "Neighbour Points," or "London Gifts"
- Test multiple naming options with target community members before finalizing
- Consider an evocative symbol rather than a numerical denomination (e.g., â¦¿ symbols rather than "5 credits")
- Frame exchanges as "sharing" rather than "transactions" in all communications

## 2. Valuation Approach

**Insights from Scott:**
- Fixed valuations (like Ithaca Hours' $10/hour) created significant friction points
- Scott mentioned the importance of a valuations process: "We would have to set the relative valuation of those things... that is a specific part of the process."
- The transcript discussed various options (burgers, transit tokens, maple syrup) but emphasized normative value everyone understands

**Issues in Current Plan:**
- Fixed "1 Credit = 30 minutes of work OR $10 value" creates the same issues as Ithaca Hours
- Documentation doesn't fully address how diverse goods/services would be valued relative to each other
- Limited discussion of how valuations might evolve over time with inflation

**Recommendations:**
- Replace fixed values with participant-led valuation processes
- Document B.05-principles-and-values.md should include "Fair Valuation" as a core principle
- Create a "Valuation Working Group" as part of the governance structure
- Consider a simple tiered system initially (small, medium, large value) rather than precise numerical values
- Add detailed guidance on the collaborative valuation process, including community input

## 3. Business Integration & Scale

**Insights from Scott:**
- "Working with too small a pool may not be worth the effort, cost benefit?"
- Scott suggested starting by connecting with existing networks like downtown businesses 
- Real businesses provide actual goods and services people need/want
- A survey approach can identify networks, willingness, and common areas of interest

**Issues in Current Plan:**
- The invitation-only membership model with 20-30 founding members may create a closed ecosystem with limited immediate value
- Business integration appears as a "future development" rather than foundational
- Limited discussion of connecting to existing economic flows

**Recommendations:**
- Integrate local businesses from day one, particularly those already using Downtown Dollars
- Approach key anchor businesses (coffee shops, grocers like Reimagine) as founding members
- Modify onboarding to include business-specific pathways
- Create concrete business value propositions (customer loyalty, reduced transaction fees)
- Consider the "Bristol Pay" pivot Scott mentioned - focus on the payment network first, then add the values-added components

## 4. Technology & Usability

**Insights from Scott:**
- "It needs to be frictionless" at point of sale
- Paper systems couldn't compete with evolving payment technologies
- Scott highlighted the "high friction at the point of sale" as a key failure of Ithaca Hours
- The experience should be as seamless as possible - "one boop" for payments

**Issues in Current Plan:**
- Google Sheets in Phase 1 creates significant friction for transactions
- Manual reporting of exchanges to stewards will deter usage
- The transition to Sarafu.Network is targeted for 7+ months in, which may be too late

**Recommendations:**
- Accelerate technology adoption timeline
- Consider starting with Citizen Wallet (mentioned in transcript) for seamless mobile transactions
- Implement a lightweight system with QR codes from day one
- Ensure ability to do split payments (part conventional currency, part community credits)
- Focus on "tap to pay" simplicity from the beginning, even in pilot phase

## 5. Operational Sustainability

**Insights from Scott:**
- "I cannot sustain it on volunteer energy. This is way too much work."
- "You're running a network with hundreds of businesses"
- Scott emphasized the need for a team of 3-5 people and proper funding
- Chambers typically get "a few hundred thousand dollars a year in operating expenses"

**Issues in Current Plan:**
- Heavy reliance on volunteer stewards without clear financial sustainability model
- Limited discussion of funding mechanisms beyond member contributions
- Underestimation of workload for managing exchanges, onboarding, and support

**Recommendations:**
- Develop a business model for operational sustainability from the beginning
- Consider a hybrid funding approach: grants, business membership fees, transaction fees
- Include a paid coordinator position in the initial plan, even part-time
- Establish clear metrics for financial sustainability along with social impact metrics
- Explore partnerships with institutions (city government, university, hospital) for operational support

## 6. The Four Core Protocols

**Insights from Scott:**
- Four essential protocols from Grassroots Economics: Curation, Valuation, Limitation, and Exchange
- These create a structured foundation for community currencies
- Scott emphasized that protocols for sun-setting/closing cycles are critically important

**Issues in Current Plan:**
- While all four protocols are present, they're not equally emphasized or explicitly named
- Limited attention to sun-setting and rebalancing mechanisms
- The "Limitation" protocol needs more attention regarding credit limits and system boundaries

**Recommendations:**
- Explicitly structure documentation around these four protocols
- Add a dedicated section in B.03-how-it-works.md that defines and explains each protocol
- Create concrete guidance for each protocol including community involvement
- Strengthen the "Limitation" aspects with clearer guidelines on credit limits and consequences
- Add more details on cyclical rebalancing and the "closing" of cycles (perhaps seasonal or annual)

## 7. Starting Strategy

**Insights from Scott:**
- Community economic survey as an entry point to identify networks and participants
- Finding businesses who need help utilizing existing credits/currencies
- Demonstrated execution capacity to build credibility
- "Start there as the baseline. Then you're adding in these value-added things."

**Issues in Current Plan:**
- Launch approach focuses on relationship building first, then adding economic components
- "Build it and they will come" versus addressing existing pain points
- Limited discussion of leveraging existing networks and currencies

**Recommendations:**
- Begin with a comprehensive community economic survey
- Identify specific pain points in the current economic landscape to address
- Target "stale" Downtown Dollars or other existing community currencies as entry points
- Focus initial messaging on solving concrete problems rather than building a new system
- Consider a "merit" style recognition system as an entry point (rewarding community contributions)

## 8. Concrete Next Steps

Based on this analysis, here are specific next steps to consider:

1. **Conduct Community Economic Survey**
   - Map existing community currency usage in London
   - Identify businesses interested in participation
   - Document specific economic pain points to address

2. **Revise Naming & Framing**
   - Test multiple naming options with community members
   - Simplify language throughout documentation
   - Create visual identity based on community feedback

3. **Develop Business Integration Strategy**
   - Create specific value propositions for different business types
   - Identify 5-10 anchor businesses for pilot phase
   - Design business-specific onboarding materials

4. **Accelerate Technology Plan**
   - Evaluate Citizen Wallet or other mobile-first solutions
   - Implement simple QR code system from day one
   - Ensure seamless payment experience in pilot phase

5. **Establish Operational Sustainability**
   - Draft business model for operational funding
   - Identify potential grant sources
   - Consider paid coordinator position from early stages

## Additional Considerations

- **Geographic Focus**: Consider starting with a concentrated geographic area (e.g., Old East Village) rather than city-wide
- **Demurrage/Expiration**: Explore the stamp script model mentioned by Scott where currency requires periodic "renewal"
- **Downtown London BIA Partnership**: Explore formal partnership with Downtown London to revitalize Downtown Dollars
- **Neighborhood Commons Model**: Explore the nested-circle model mentioned in G.02-neighbourhood-networks.md as a pathway to scaling
- **Existing Community Assets**: Conduct an inventory of existing community assets that could form the initial backbone of the system

This critical analysis aims to strengthen what is already a thoughtful and promising plan. The CCC concept has tremendous potential, particularly with our unique positioning at the intersection of community building and local business through Reimagine.
