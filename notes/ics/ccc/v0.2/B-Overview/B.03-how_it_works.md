# How It Works: The Two Pathways

Community Exchange operates through two complementary systems, each with its own pathway for participation. Members can engage with either or both, depending on their interests, needs, and capacity.

## Connection Circles Pathway

Connection Circles create ongoing relationships around skills, interests, and learning. Here's how to participate:

1. **Join the Community**: Attend an orientation session to learn about the Connection Circles program
2. **Profile Creation**: Share your interests, skills you can teach, and things you want to learn
3. **Attend Monthly Gatherings**: Participate in facilitated sessions where connections are made based on shared interests
4. **Ongoing Matching**: Between gatherings, facilitators continue connecting people with complementary interests
5. **Skill Sharing & Learning**: Meet one-on-one or in small groups to share knowledge and skills
6. **Relationship Building**: Develop deeper community connections through meaningful exchanges
7. **Community Cultivation**: Help shape the evolution of the program through feedback and participation

> **Like a forest and its mycorrhizal network.** What we see above ground—the trees, shrubs, and plants—is similar to our Connection Circles where community members visibly interact and share. Underground, an intricate network of fungal connections helps trees share nutrients and information—much like our Commitment Pool that quietly facilitates resource exchange. Just as the forest's resilience depends on both what's visible and invisible, our community thrives through both public connections and structured exchanges.

## Commitment Pool Pathway

The Commitment Pool facilitates tangible exchanges of goods and services through a credit system. Here's how it works:

1. **Orientation**: Learn about the credit system and how to participate
2. **Resource Offering**: Register specific goods or services you can provide to the community
3. **Record Keeping**: Your commitments are formalized in the community ledger
4. **Fulfilling Commitments**: Provide your offered services or goods to other members
5. **Earning Credits**: Receive credits in the ledger for contributions you make
6. **Redeeming Credits**: Use accumulated credits to receive services or goods from other members
7. **Periodic Review**: Participate in regular assessment of the pool's health and balance

## Examples of Typical Exchanges

### In Connection Circles:

- **Skill Sharing**: Marina teaches Sanjay how to make sourdough bread over three sessions, while he later helps her learn basic carpentry.
- **Interest Groups**: Five members who share an interest in permaculture form a study group that meets monthly in different gardens.
- **Knowledge Exchange**: A retired professor offers informal history discussions in exchange for smartphone tutorials from younger members.
- **Collaborative Projects**: Three members with complementary skills (design, carpentry, and coordination) collaborate to create a community noticeboard.

### In the Commitment Pool:

- **Goods Exchange**: Juan offers homemade jams valued at 5 credits each; he uses those credits to receive childcare from Aisha.
- **Service Swap**: Priya offers 3 hours of graphic design (15 credits); she later uses these credits for bicycle repairs from Karim.
- **Mixed Exchange**: David repairs Lee's laptop (10 credits) and uses those credits toward fresh vegetables from various members' gardens.
- **Group Coordination**: Five members use their collective credits to arrange a community space cleanup, with each contributor receiving an equal share of credits.

## Joining Both Pathways

Many members find value in participating in both systems:

- A connection made in Connection Circles might evolve into a formalized exchange through the Commitment Pool
- Trust built through successful Commitment Pool exchanges often leads to deeper relationships in Connection Circles
- Skills discovered in one pathway can be offered in the other
- The full richness of Community Exchange emerges when both relationship-building and structured exchange work in harmony

## Getting Started

The Community Exchange is launching with a small pilot group in Q2 2025. If you've received this document, you're invited to be part of this initial community. Together, we'll build a more resilient, connected, and abundant local economy.
