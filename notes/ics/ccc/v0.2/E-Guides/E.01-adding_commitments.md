# How to Add a Commitment to the Pool

This guide walks you through the process of adding your commitments to the Community Exchange pool, making your skills, resources, or time available to other members.

## Step 1: Identify What You Can Offer

Before creating a formal commitment, take some time to reflect on:

- **Skills**: What can you do well? (cooking, carpentry, writing, teaching, etc.)
- **Time**: What services could you provide? (childcare, elder companionship, rides, etc.)
- **Resources**: What do you have that others might need? (tools, garden space, books, etc.)
- **Interests**: What do you enjoy doing that others might value? (playing music, organizing, etc.)

**Helpful Reflection Questions:**
- What do friends and family often ask you to help with?
- What activities do you find energizing rather than draining?
- What resources do you have that sit unused much of the time?
- What do you wish you could do more of in your community?

Review the Commitment Examples document for inspiration. Remember that sustainable commitments align with your natural interests and capacity.

## Step 2: Define Your Commitment Details

Be specific about what you're offering to ensure clear expectations:

- **Precise Description**: Exactly what service or item are you offering?
- **Quantity or Scope**: How much are you offering? (hours, servings, items, etc.)
- **Limitations**: Any boundaries on your offer? (geographic, timing, prerequisites, etc.)
- **Valuation**: How many credits do you feel is fair for this offering?

**Examples of Well-Defined Commitments:**
- "2 hours of garden help per month, weekends only, within 5km of downtown, 2 credits"
- "One homemade vegetarian meal (serves 4), delivered weekly, 3 credits"
- "Bicycle tune-up, basic maintenance only, at my home workshop, 2 credits"
- "Math tutoring, grades 6-10, up to 3 hours monthly, online or at library, 1 credit per hour"

## Step 3: Submit Your Commitment

4. **Report Completion**: 
   - Phase 1: Email a steward with exchange details
   - Phase 2: Mark as complete in the Sarafu.Network system
