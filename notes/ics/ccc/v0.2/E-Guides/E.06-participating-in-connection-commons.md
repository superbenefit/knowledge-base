# How to Participate in the Connection Commons

The Connection Commons is one of the three foundational programs within our community system. This guide will help you understand how to engage with this program, particularly through its main activity: the Belonging Circle.

## What is the Connection Commons?

The Connection Commons is the program that facilitates relationship-building and skill-sharing within our community. While the program operates continuously through matching and connection-making between community members, it centers around the Belonging Circle - monthly gatherings where these connections are nurtured and celebrated.

## The Belonging Circle: Monthly Gatherings

The Belonging Circle gatherings are 2-hour sessions (either in-person or hybrid format) designed to strengthen community bonds and facilitate exchanges. Each session includes:
- A welcome and brief system updates
- Facilitated sharing based on thoughtful prompts
- Small group conversations 
- Closing activities to identify potential exchanges and commitments

## Before the Belonging Circle

### Preparation
- **RSVP** if requested by the organizers
- **Reflect** on what you might want to share or learn
- Consider your current **needs and offerings** that you could bring up
- **Review** your recent exchanges and current commitments
- Arrive a few minutes early to help set up if possible

### What to Bring
- A notebook or way to record connections and ideas
- Your commitment catalog or access to it on your device (optional)
- Food or drink to share if it's a potluck-style event
- An open mind and willingness to connect

## During the Belonging Circle

### 1. Arrival and Welcome (15-20 minutes)
- Arrive on time and sign in
- Get a name tag if provided
- Greet other participants and engage in informal conversation
- Find a comfortable seat in the circle
- Listen attentively to the facilitator's welcome and any announcements

### 2. Opening Round (20-30 minutes)
- The facilitator will explain the format and often pose an opening question
- When it's your turn, briefly introduce yourself
- Share based on the opening prompt (e.g., "What inspired you recently?" or "What's something you're looking forward to?")
- Be concise to ensure everyone has time to speak
- Listen attentively to others without interrupting

### 3. Main Activity (45-60 minutes)
- Participate actively in the structured activities
- This may include small group discussions, pair shares, or whole group exercises
- Listen deeply to others' contributions
- Share your own thoughts, experiences, and ideas
- Note potential connections or exchange possibilities
- Ask clarifying questions if needed
- Respect different perspectives and experiences

### 4. Resource Mapping (as applicable)
- Share your skills, resources, or needs when prompted
- Be specific about what you can offer or what you're looking for
- Note offers that might meet your needs
- Consider how your offerings might help others

### 5. Closing (20-30 minutes)
- Participate in the wrap-up activity
- Share any commitments or connections you'd like to pursue
- Express gratitude for specific insights or offerings
- Volunteer for any upcoming tasks if you're able
- Help with cleanup if needed

## After the Belonging Circle

### Following Up
- **Contact individuals** you connected with within a few days
- Follow through on any **commitments** you made during the gathering
- **Contact the steward** if you want to add a new commitment based on the connections made
- **Add events** mentioned during the gathering to your calendar
- **Reflect** on what you learned or discovered

### Deepening Engagement in the Connection Commons
- Consider volunteering to help facilitate a future Belonging Circle
- Invite others who might benefit from the community (after your first 3 months)
- Suggest topics or activities for future circles
- Share your experience with the stewards to help improve the process
- Engage with the Connection Commons between Belonging Circles through one-on-one connections

## Special Considerations

### For First-Time Participants
- Arrive a few minutes early to meet the facilitator
- Don't worry about understanding everything right away
- Focus on making a few connections rather than trying to engage with everyone
- Ask questions when you're unsure about something
- Consider requesting a buddy to help navigate your first few exchanges

### For Online Participation
- Test your technology before the meeting
- Use a quiet space with minimal distractions
- Keep your video on when possible to help build connection
- Use the chat feature to share resources or contact information
- Follow up promptly after the meeting while connections are fresh

## Remember
The Connection Commons program and its Belonging Circle gatherings are designed to be welcoming, inclusive spaces where relationships can form and deepen over time. The more you participate, the more value you'll receive and contribute to the community.
