## Tips for Successful Requests

- **Plan Ahead**: Allow sufficient time for responses and coordination

- **Be Flexible**: Remember providers are community members with their own schedules
- **Communicate Promptly**: Respond to messages in a timely manner
- **Show Appreciation**: Express gratitude for the exchange
- **Honor the Agreement**: Don't request additions or extensions beyond what was agreed
- **Give Feedback**: Constructive feedback helps improve the system for everyone
- **Reciprocate**: Consider how you might contribute back to the pool

## What If Things Don't Go as Planned?

- **Provider Doesn't Respond**: If you don't hear back within 48 hours, contact a steward
- **Need to Cancel**: Give as much notice as possible and communicate directly
- **Quality Concerns**: Discuss directly with the provider first; if unresolved, speak with a steward
- **Misunderstandings**: Refer back to the original commitment description and communicate openly
- **Credit Disputes**: Contact a steward for mediation if needed

Remember, the Community Exchange works best when we approach each interaction with patience, clear communication, and goodwill!
