# How to Handle Exchange Issues

In any community system, challenges occasionally arise. This guide provides step-by-step approaches for handling common exchange issues with clarity, respect, and fairness.

## If You Can't Fulfill a Commitment

### 1. Communicate Early

**As soon as you know there's a problem:**
- Contact the requester immediatelyâ€”don't wait and hope things change
- Use their preferred communication method (phone, text, email)
- Be direct and honest about the situation
- Provide context without lengthy excuses

**Example message:**
> "Hi [Name], I'm reaching out about the garden help I committed to this Saturday. Unfortunately, I've come down with the flu and won't be able to help as planned. I wanted to let you know right away so we can figure out alternatives."

### 2. Offer Alternatives

**When possible, suggest options such as:**
- A different time or date: "Could we reschedule for next week when I'm better?"
- A modified service: "I can't do the full garden, but I could help with just the weeding."
- A replacement provider: "My neighbor Sarah also gardens and might be available."

**Steps for finding a replacement:**
1. Consider other members with similar skills
2. Ask them directly if they might be available
3. Facilitate an introduction to the requester
4. Inform a steward about the change

### 3. Make It Right

**For rescheduling:**
- Offer specific alternative dates
- Be flexible with time frames
- Confirm the new arrangement in writing
- Set a reminder for yourself

**If cancelling entirely:**
- Acknowledge the inconvenience clearly
- Offer a "make good" if appropriate ("I can add an extra hour next time")
- Follow through on any new commitments promptly

**When credit adjustments are needed:**
- Contact a steward to explain the situation
- Be prepared to suggest fair resolution options
- Accept the community standard for similar situations

## If Someone Doesn't Fulfill a Commitment to You

### 1. Direct Communication

**First approach:**
- Wait 24 hours after the missed commitment (when possible)
- Reach out directly to the provider
- Assume good intentions initially
- Use "I" statements rather than accusations

**Example opening:**
> "Hi [Name], I wanted to check in about the computer help we had scheduled yesterday. I was expecting you at 3pm but didn't hear from you. Is everything okay?"

**When discussing the issue:**
- Focus on the specific commitment that wasn't met
- Express how it affected you
- Stay factual rather than emotional
- Be clear about what you need now

### 2. Seek Steward Support If Needed

**When to involve a steward:**
- After attempting direct communication with no response
- If communication becomes difficult or uncomfortable
- When there's disagreement about what was promised
- If a pattern of missed commitments emerges

**How to request help:**
1. Email the steward circle or a specific steward
2. Provide a clear timeline of events
3. Include any written communication about the commitment
4. Explain what you've done to resolve it directly
5. State what resolution you're hoping for

**Example request:**
> "I'm writing about a missed commitment for childcare that was scheduled for May 15th. I've messaged [Provider] twice with no response. This affected my ability to attend a job interview. I'd appreciate support in either rescheduling the care or finding an alternative solution."

### 3. Resolution Options

**For minor issues, consider:**
- Simple rescheduling
- Clarification of expectations for next time
- Accepting a sincere apology and moving on

**For more significant problems:**
- Finding an alternative provider
- Credit adjustment if appropriate (requires steward approval)
- Learning conversation with steward facilitation

**Documentation for future reference:**
- Keep notes on how the issue was resolved
- Save any written communications
- Follow up with the steward on any system improvements

## Preventing Future Issues

### Clear Communication

**When offering a commitment:**
- Be specific about what you're offering
- Note any limitations or conditions
- Be realistic about your availability
- Update your commitments when your capacity changes

**When requesting services:**
- Confirm all details in writing
- Send a reminder 24-48 hours before
- Provide clear location information
- Share contact information for day-of coordination

### Building Better Exchanges

**After resolving an issue:**
- Reflect on what you learned
- Consider if your commitments match your capacity
- Adjust your offerings if needed
- Don't take misunderstandings personally

**For recurring exchanges:**
- Create shared expectations
- Develop a standard process
- Build in confirmation steps
- Establish preferred communication channels

## Community-Level Resolution

### Connection Circle Discussions

Sometimes broader patterns need community attention:
- Bring systemic issues to Connection Circles
- Focus on improving processes, not individuals
- Suggest constructive changes
- Volunteer to help implement solutions

### Policy Development

If similar issues arise repeatedly:
- Work with stewards to develop clearer guidelines
- Help document best practices
- Participate in community standard-setting
- Support orientation improvements

### Supporting New Members

Experienced members can help by:
- Mentoring newcomers on exchange protocols
- Modeling good communication practices
- Being patient with early missteps
- Sharing what you've learned from your own challenges

## Special Circumstances

### Health or Family Emergencies

When unexpected crises occur:
- Communicate what you can, when you can
- Ask a friend to notify others if you're unable
- Request grace period from stewards if needed
- Accept support from the community

### Long-term Capacity Changes

If your ability to participate changes significantly:
- Meet with a steward to discuss your situation
- Adjust your commitments realistically
- Consider moving to inactive status if needed
- Create a re-entry plan when appropriate

### Natural Disasters or Community Emergencies

During community-wide crises:
- Normal exchange expectations may be suspended
- Focus on immediate needs and mutual aid
- Document emergency assistance for later credit allocation
- Follow steward guidance on system adjustments
