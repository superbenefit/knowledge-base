# $MAPLE: The Canadian Regenerative Value Token

## Overview

$MAPLE is an envisioned CAD-pegged token designed to support Canadian regenerative financial ecosystems and integrate with the Community Exchange (CCC) platform. As a decentralized community currency, $MAPLE would generate yield that supports both network stability and Canadian regenerative initiatives.

## Positioning with $BREAD

## Core Use Cases

$MAPLE serves three primary functions:

1. **Intra-DAO Transactions**: Facilitating seamless value exchange within and between Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
2. **Canadian DAO Contributor Payments**: Enabling organizations to compensate Canadian contributors in a currency that maintains CAD purchasing power
3. **Auto-PGF Treasury Holdings**: Serving as a stable reserve asset for Automatic Public Goods Funding (Auto-PGF) mechanisms

### Positioning with $BREAD

$MAPLE and $BREAD serve different but complementary purposes:
- $BREAD: Regenerative CAD-denominated value token for wider economic transformation
- $MAPLE: Specifically designed for Canadian commitment pool networks

Both support regenerative economics through different approaches:
- $BREAD focuses on yield generation for mutual aid
- $MAPLE focuses on facilitating community commitment exchanges and DAO operations

Our communities naturally align and may interact, but these are distinct systems with distinct purposes.

### Liquidity Pair Strategy

**BREAD-MAPLE Liquidity Pools**:
1. **Economic Bridge**: Enable seamless trading between US and Canadian regenerative economies
2. **Arbitrage Protection**: Maintain relative value stability between the two currencies
3. **Cross-Border Cooperation**: Facilitate international mutual aid and community projects
4. **Deeper Liquidity**: Combined pool depth increases stability for both tokens

**Liquidity Benefits**:
- Lower slippage for cross-border transactions
- Reduced forex conversion costs
- Stable value for regenerative initiatives operating in both countries
- Increased adoption through network effects

### Economic Synergies

1. **Shared Value Creation**: Both communities benefit from each other's economic activity
2. **Risk Diversification**: Currency risks spread across two national economies
3. **Knowledge Exchange**: Technical and social innovations flow bi-directionally
4. **Scaling Effects**: Combined userbase strengthens both ecosystems

## Integration with Community Exchange

### Connection Circles Integration

1. **Skill Exchange Economy**: Members can offer skills/services priced in $MAPLE for those preferring immediate settlement
2. **Cross-Pool Facilitation**: $MAPLE acts as a bridge when Connection Circle relationships evolve into formalized exchanges across different pools
3. **Value Recognition**: Outstanding contributions in Connection Circles could earn $MAPLE rewards, creating incentives for quality engagement

### Commitment Pool Integration

1. **Reserve Asset**: Commitment pools can hold $MAPLE as a stable reserve alongside credits
2. **Inter-Pool Trading**: Different commitment pools can trade using $MAPLE when direct credit swaps aren't feasible
3. **Exit Option**: Members can convert earned credits to $MAPLE to connect with the broader economy
4. **Boundary Objects**: $MAPLE serves as a "boundary object" allowing credits to cross between pools with different valuations

## Technical Architecture

### Governance Structure
- Operates via a DAO to maintain decentralization
- Community decision-making for yield distribution (similar to $BREAD model)
- Transparent on-chain governance for all major decisions

### Collateralization Model
- **Phase 1**: 120% overcollateralization using USDC/USDT
- **Phase 2**: Transition to Canadian asset backing as they become tokenized
  - Canadian Government Investment Certificates (GICs)
  - Tokenized Canadian ETFs
  - Canadian Community Impact Bonds
  - Canadian Real World Assets (RWAs)

### Exchange Mechanism
- USDC-to-MAPLE swaps (direct fiat exchange avoided initially)
- Dynamic exchange rates based on supply, demand, and USD/CAD forex rates

## Conversion Rate Structure

### Credit-to-$MAPLE Exchange Rates
- Individual commitment pools set their own exchange rates
- Market-based fluctuation within steward-defined bands (e.g., 1 credit = 5-10 $MAPLE)
- Quarterly adjustments based on:
  - Community demand
  - Pool health metrics
  - Regional economic conditions
  - Actual usage patterns

## Yield Distribution System

### Dynamic Yield Allocation
1. **Below Collateralization Target**: Yield goes to treasury for stability
2. **Above Target**: Yield distributed to regenerative charities accepting MAPLE
3. Yield generation sources:
   - Interest from collateral assets
   - Sell fees (encouraging circular economy)
   - DeFi yield farming strategies

### Community Governance
- Quarterly voting on yield recipient selection
- Transparent reporting on yield generation and distribution
- Open nomination process for funding recipients

## Risk Management Framework

### Collateralization Management
1. **Multi-Asset Backing**: Diversification across Canadian treasury bills, municipal bonds, and community impact bonds
2. **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic trading halts if exchange rates move beyond 5% daily thresholds
3. **Emergency Liquidation Protocols**: Clear processes for crisis scenarios

### Financial Safeguards
1. **Insurance Pool**: 5% of yield dedicated to emergency fund
2. **Gradual Launch**: Supply caps that increase as system proves stable
3. **Stress Testing**: Regular simulations of market shock scenarios

### Trust & Verification
1. **Community Oracle Network**: Multiple trusted community members verify exchange rates
2. **Third-Party Audits**: Regular audits by independent blockchain security firms
3. **Trusted Entity Involvement**:
   - Green Pill Network chapters as validators
   - Indigenous-led organizations for place-based legitimacy
   - Academic institutions for research partnerships
   - Local credit unions for traditional financial bridge-building

## Economic Design Features

### Fee Structure
- Sell fees that support treasury (encourages holding)
- Lower fees for asset-type transactions
- Minimal fees for community-to-community transfers

### Incentive Mechanisms
1. **Holding Rewards**: Yield generation for supporting Canadian regenerative initiatives
2. **Participation Rewards**: $MAPLE awards for active Community Exchange participants
3. **Liquidity Incentives**: Rewards for providing BREAD-$MAPLE liquidity

## Regulatory Approach

### Decentralized Governance
- DAO-based operation bypasses traditional regulatory jurisdiction
- Marshall Islands registration as many crypto projects use
- No direct fiat on-ramps to avoid MSB licensing requirements

### Compliance Considerations
- KYC/AML handled at exchange points (USDC conversion)
- Clear documentation of non-security token status
- Transparency reports for community accountability

## Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6)
- Deploy smart contracts on testnet
- Build $MAPLE-USDC liquidity pools
- Create DAO governance structure
- Engage first trust partners

### Phase 2: Pilot (Months 7-12)
- Launch with supply cap on mainnet
- Integration with first CCC pilots
- Build BREAD-$MAPLE bridges
- Expand trusted validator network

### Phase 3: Growth (Year 2)
- Increase supply caps
- Onboard Canadian asset tokenization partners
- Scale across more CCC implementations
- Build partnerships with Canadian institutions

## Key Success Metrics

1. **Stability**: Maintain CAD peg within 1% deviation
2. **Adoption**: Growing number of CCC pools accepting $MAPLE
3. **Yield Generation**: Consistent returns for holders
4. **Community Impact**: Value distributed to regenerative initiatives
5. **Liquidity**: Healthy BREAD-$MAPLE trading volume

## Vision: National Implications

The ultimate aspiration is for $MAPLE to grow from a community currency into a national infrastructure. As Canadian tokenization matures, the government could:
- Add liquidity to existing $MAPLE pools
- Use $MAPLE for national regenerative initiatives
- Potentially adopt it as a complementary digital currency

### Fractal Scaling Architecture
- BREAD: Umbrella for multiple regional networks (like $MAPLE, SYRUP)
- $MAPLE: Regional layer for London/Ontario
- Local pools: Individual communities
- Sub-pools: Granular divisions within pools

### Emergence-Friendly Design
- $MAPLE could grow from regional to provincial to national
- Architecture allows for organic expansion or federation
- Sub-pools enable deeper local customization
- Naming follows function rather than predetermined hierarchy

This represents a bottom-up approach to national digital currency, starting with communities rather than institutions.

## Technical Specifications (Preliminary)
