# Community Connection & Commitment Commons: Risks and Mitigation Strategies

**Note on Content Creation:** This risk assessment combines AI-assisted research on global community currency systems with careful curation and adaptation for the London, Ontario context. While AI tools helped identify patterns from international examples, all content has been reviewed, modified, and contextualized by the ICS team for local relevance and accuracy.

This document identifies potential risks to the Community Connection & Commitment Commons system and outlines strategies to address them, informed by experiences from similar initiatives around the world.

## Commitment Voucher System Risks

### Risk: Commitment Voucher Hoarding
**Description**: Members accumulate Vouchers without spending them, reducing circulation in the system. However, in mutual credit systems, this is often beneficial as it removes supply from circulation and prevents system overload.

**Understanding Mutual Credit vs Traditional Finance:**
- In traditional finance, hoarding creates scarcity and slows the economy
- In mutual credit systems, hoarding provides "breathing room" by reducing immediate service demands
- Commitment Vouchers represent unfulfilled commitments, so holding Vouchers delays (but doesn't eliminate) service obligations
- This creates a natural buffer that prevents system overwhelm when many people try to redeem services at once
- Unlike in traditional finance where hoarding resources is problematic, in mutual credit systems members holding positive balances actually benefits the overall system by reducing pressure on fulfillment
- When members hold positive balances, it effectively removes that supply from circulation, creating capacity in the system for others to make commitments

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Commitment Voucher Expiration**: Vouchers expire after 3 months of inactivity  
  *Note: This fixed expiration period is for the pilot phase only, chosen for ease of tracking in Google Sheets. Future versions may implement more sophisticated decay mechanisms like half-life demurrage.*
- **Encouragement**: Regular reminders about available offerings
- **Matchmaking**: Stewards actively connect members with Vouchers to relevant offerings
- **Celebration**: Highlight active exchanges in community gatherings

**Example from Practice**: The Dane County TimeBank in Wisconsin implemented a similar Voucher expiration policy, resulting in a 30% increase in exchanges within the first month.

### Risk: Commitment Voucher Deficit (Members Leaving with Negative Balance)
**Description**: Members take value from the system and leave without contributing back.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Issuance Limit**: Maximum -10 Commitment Voucher balance (primary constraint to prevent over-promising)
- **Trust Building**: Invitation-only membership creates accountability
- **Exit Protocol**: Process requires fulfillment of all issued Vouchers (negative balances) before departing
  - Members may keep positive balances upon exit
  - Unfulfilled negative balances harm other members by creating worthless Vouchers
- **Bounded Risk**: System-wide impact is limited by individual Voucher limits
- **Regular Review**: Monthly monitoring of balances approaching limits

**Example from Practice**: The Lewes Pound in the UK had several instances of members leaving with negative balances. Their closed-loop system and limit on negative balances ensured these losses were absorbed without threatening the overall system.

### Risk: Inflation/Devaluation
**Description**: Commitment Vouchers lose perceived value if there's insufficient real value backing them.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Quality Standards**: Expectations for the quality of offerings
- **Value Guidelines**: Clear guidance on appropriate Voucher valuation
- **Feedback System**: Way for members to provide feedback on exchanges
- **Community Discussion**: Regular review of valuation standards
- **Adjustment Mechanism**: Process for addressing systematic valuation issues

**Example from Practice**: The Ithaca HOURS system maintained value stability for over two decades by having clear guidelines about the relationship between hours and dollars, plus a community review process for all new offerings.

## Participation Risks

### Risk: Uneven Participation
**Description**: Some members are very active while others rarely participate.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Regular Reminders**: Gentle prompts about participation
- **Diversity of Offerings**: Ensure wide range of commitment types
- **Skill Building**: Workshops to help members identify what they can offer
- **Belonging Circle**: Regular opportunities to surface needs and offerings
- **Recognition**: Celebrate different forms of participation

**Example from Practice**: The hOurworld timebank network found that quarterly "recommitment" gatherings where members publicly share what they can offer dramatically increased participation rates.

### Risk: Dominance of Certain Skills or Services
**Description**: The system becomes imbalanced with too many similar offerings.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Needs Assessment**: Regular survey of what members actually need
- **Targeted Recruitment**: Invite members with complementary skills
- **Skill Development**: Workshops to build capacity in high-demand areas
- **Creative Matchmaking**: Help members recognize non-obvious skills
- **Limitation Adjustments**: Manage the quantity of similar offerings in the pool

**Example from Practice**: The Fourth Corner Exchange in Washington State created a "wish list" system where members could post needed services, allowing stewards to recruit specifically for those skills.

### Risk: Administrative Burden on Stewards
**Description**: Stewards become overwhelmed with system maintenance tasks.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Rotation**: Share stewardship responsibilities
- **Clear Processes**: Well-documented procedures
- **Automation**: Use technology to reduce manual work
- **Distributed Tasks**: Break stewardship into manageable roles
- **Recognition**: Acknowledge and reward stewardship work

**Example from Practice**: The Community Exchange System (CES) in South Africa created rotating administrative teams with 3-month terms to prevent burnout and distribute knowledge.

## Technological Risks

### Risk: Technology Barriers
**Description**: Digital tools create access barriers for some members.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Multi-modal Access**: Offer both digital and analog options
- **Buddy System**: Pair tech-comfortable with tech-hesitant members
- **Training Sessions**: Regular workshops on using system tools
- **Simple Design**: Keep interfaces intuitive and accessible
- **Plain Language**: Avoid technical jargon in all communications

**Example from Practice**: The Zurich-based mutual aid network TAUSCHERIA maintains both digital and paper-based recording systems, allowing members to choose their preferred method without exclusion.

### Risk: Data Loss or Corruption
**Description**: Transaction history or Commitment Voucher balances are lost or corrupted.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Regular Backups**: Weekly export of all system data
- **Distributed Records**: Multiple copies of critical information
- **Verification Process**: Monthly reconciliation and audit
- **Paper Trail**: Physical backup of key transactions
- **Recovery Protocol**: Clear process for resolving discrepancies

**Example from Practice**: The Bay Area Community Exchange lost three months of transaction data due to a server crash. Their weekly paper backup system allowed them to reconstruct the ledger with minimal disruption.

## Social Risks

### Risk: Quality or Reliability Issues
**Description**: Members don't deliver on commitments at expected quality or timeliness.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Clear Expectations**: Guidelines for reliability and quality
- **Feedback System**: Way for members to rate exchanges
- **Dispute Resolution**: Process for addressing issues
- **Skillsharing**: Support for members to improve their offerings
- **Appropriate Valuation**: Ensure Commitment Vouchers reflect quality and skill level

**Example from Practice**: The Helsinki Timebank implemented a simple "fulfilled as expected" feedback system that helped maintain quality while still honoring different skill levels.

### Risk: Interpersonal Conflicts
**Description**: Disagreements between members disrupt the system or community.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Community Agreements**: Clear expectations for behavior
- **Graduated Response**: Tiered approach to conflict resolution
- **Facilitated Dialogue**: Trained mediators available
- **Restoration Practices**: Focus on healing relationships
- **Learning Orientation**: Use conflicts as opportunities for system improvement

**Example from Practice**: The Blaengarw Time Centre in Wales created a "community council" specifically trained in mediation that successfully resolved over 30 conflicts in their first two years.

### Risk: Legal or Regulatory Concerns
**Description**: Uncertainty about legal status or tax implications.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Clear Framing**: Position as mutual aid network, not currency
- **Educational Materials**: Information about legal precedents
- **Transparent Records**: Clear documentation of all activities
- **Professional Advice**: Consult with legal and tax professionals
- **Connection**: Link with other legally established systems
- **Tax Clarity**: Provide clear information that members are personally responsible for determining any tax obligations with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)
- **Open Ledger**: Maintain an open ledger system that records all exchanges, which members can use for their own record-keeping
- **Educational Resources**: Offer general information about mutual credit systems and taxation without providing specific tax advice

**Example from Practice**: The Brisbane LETS system in Australia developed clear documentation explaining their mutual aid framework, which has helped them operate for over 25 years without legal challenges.

## Long-Term Sustainability Risks

### Risk: Founder Dependency
**Description**: System relies too heavily on founding members and struggles if they depart.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Document all processes and decisions
- **Skill Building**: Train multiple members in all key functions
- **Gradual Transition**: Planned handover periods
- **Distributed Responsibility**: Avoid single points of failure
- **Succession Planning**: Identify and develop future stewards early

**Example from Practice**: The Hudson Valley Current implemented a "steward in training" program where each founding member mentored two newer members, ensuring continuity when several founders moved away.

### Risk: Scaling Challenges
**Description**: System works well small but faces difficulties as it grows.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Ecosystem Model**: Create multiple connected circles rather than one large system
- **Clear Boundaries**: Define optimal size for each circle
- **Inter-Circle Protocols**: Establish how circles connect and exchange
- **Graduated Growth**: Controlled expansion phases
- **Evaluation Periods**: Pauses for integration after each growth phase

**Example from Practice**: The Transition Town Totnes REconomy Project in the UK successfully scaled by creating neighborhood-based circles with "ambassadors" who facilitated inter-circle exchanges.

### Risk: Loss of Purpose or Values
**Description**: Original mission and values become diluted over time.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Values Document**: Clear articulation of founding principles
- **Regular Reflection**: Scheduled reviews of alignment with values
- **Onboarding Emphasis**: Strong focus on values during new member orientation
- **Storytelling**: Keep founding vision alive through stories
- **Celebration**: Recognize examples that exemplify values

**Example from Practice**: The Community Exchange Network Taiwan conducts quarterly "purpose renewal" sessions where members share stories about exchanges that embodied their core values, keeping the mission vibrant even after a decade.
