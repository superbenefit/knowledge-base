# Community Connection & Commitment Commons: Onboarding Process

This document outlines how new members join the Community Connection & Commitment Commons, from invitation through full participation.

## Invitation-Only Membership Model

The Community Connection & Commitment Commons uses a closed membership model to ensure trust, alignment with community values, and manageable growth:

- **Initial Members (Q2 2025)**: 20-30 founding members invited to the launch event
- **Growth Phase (Q3 2025+)**: New members join through seasonal cohorts, invited by existing members
- **Future Expansion**: The community will decide together when and how to potentially open membership further

## Cohort-Based Approach

Rather than continuous individual onboarding, new members join in cohorts:

- **Initial Cohort**: Formed at the May 7, 2025 launch event
- **Subsequent Cohorts**: Formed quarterly (or semi-annually based on community capacity)
- **Cohort Size**: Typically 10-15 new members per cohort
- **Benefits**: 
  - Creates stronger bonds between members who join together
  - Enables more efficient use of steward resources
  - Builds momentum through group learning and exchange

## Onboarding Journey

### 1. Invitation & Initial Contact

1. **Personal Invitation**: Potential members receive invitations from stewards (Phase 1) or existing members (Phase 2+)
2. **Brief Conversation**: A short, informal conversation or call introduces the concept and invites them to the cohort orientation

### 2. Group Orientation Event

New members attend a cohort orientation event (similar to the May 7 launch model):

1. **Welcome & Connection Activities**:
   - Interactive exercises to build relationships
   - Community values and principles introduction
   - Icebreakers that reveal skills and interests

2. **System Overview**:
   - Clear explanation of commitment pooling concept
   - How the system works in practice
   - Examples of successful exchanges

3. **Resource Mapping & Offering Identification**:
   - Guided activities to identify personal skills, resources, and needs
   - Creation of initial commitment offerings
   - Facilitated discussions around potential exchanges

4. **Next Steps & Integration Plan**:
   - Immediate action items for full participation
   - Connection to community resources and support
   - Calendar of upcoming activities

### 3. Initial Commitment Creation

Following the orientation event, each new member:

1. Finalizes at least two initial commitments they can offer to the pool
2. Completes a member profile with contact information and offering details
3. Signs the community agreement

### 4. System Integration

Once the initial commitment is established:

1. The member is added to the system ledger with a starting balance of 0 Commitment Vouchers
2. Their commitments are added to the pool and made visible to all members
3. They receive an invitation to the next Belonging Circle gathering
4. They're added to the communication channel (group email, Signal, etc.)

### 5. First Exchange

New members are encouraged to:

1. Attend their first Belonging Circle within 30 days of joining
2. Complete their first exchange (giving or receiving) within 60 days
3. Participate in a cohort check-in meeting after the first month

## Cohort Support System

Instead of individual mentor/mentee pairings, the cohort model provides:

- **Cohort Steward**: An experienced member who supports the entire cohort
- **Peer Support**: Encouragement to form relationships within the cohort
- **Group Check-ins**: Scheduled gatherings for the cohort to share experiences
- **Resource Library**: Digital and physical materials for self-guided learning

## Documentation Received

New members receive:

1. Welcome packet with:
   - Community Connection & Commitment Commons overview document
   - Core principles and values
   - Glossary of terms
   - Current member directory (with permission)

2. Digital access to:
   - Member handbook (detailed operations guide)
   - Access to the ledger system
   - Communication channels

## Ongoing Integration

Beyond initial onboarding:

- Quarterly cohort integration check-ins
- Regular Belonging Circles for relationship-building
- Seasonal community celebrations to strengthen ties
- Annual renewal conversation

## Offboarding Process

If a member chooses to leave:

1. They notify a steward of their intention to depart
2. They work to balance their Commitment Voucher account (aim for 0 Vouchers)
3. They complete any outstanding commitments or find replacements
4. Their member status becomes "inactive" but their contribution history is preserved
5. They're invited to a brief exit conversation to share feedback

*This onboarding process may evolve based on community feedback and experience. The stewardship circle will review and update it quarterly during the pilot phase.*
