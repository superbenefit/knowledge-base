## Implementation Note

Activities should be phased in gradually as outlined in the implementation timeline. Begin with core relationship-building activities like Connection Circles, then add specialized activities based on community interest and capacity.

### Getting Started
For the first six months, focus on:
1. Monthly Connection Circles
2. New Member Orientations (as needed)
3. Quarterly Celebration & Review
4. Steward Circle Meetings

As the system grows and matures, additional activities can be added based on community needs and interests. Supplementary activities that are not essential to commitment pooling but enhance community life can be found in the `/more-activities` folder.
