# New Member Orientation

## Purpose
To introduce new cohorts of members to the Community Exchange system, build initial relationships, and help newcomers identify their potential contributions and needs.

## Overview
New Member Orientation is a crucial entry point for anyone joining the Community Exchange. Rather than individual or small-group sessions, orientations are conducted as engaging cohort events that combine system explanation with relationship-building activities. This integrated approach helps new members understand both the practical aspects of the exchange system and begin forming connections that will support their participation.

## Format

### Duration
2.5-3 hour event

### Setting
- A comfortable, accessible community space
- Flexible seating arrangement that allows for both circle discussion and small group activities

- Visual displays showing system concepts and examples

### Frequency
- Quarterly or semi-annually, depending on growth rate
- Aligned with implementation phases
- Scheduled in advance to allow for effective recruitment of new members

### Facilitation Team
- 2-3 stewards or experienced members leading the session
- 2-3 additional members helping with activities and discussions
- Ideal ratio of 1 experienced member to 4-5 new members

## Integration with Connection Circles

The New Member Orientation deliberately incorporates elements of Connection Circles, recognizing that:

1. Relationship-building is as important as system understanding
2. New members benefit from immediately experiencing the community's culture
3. Potential exchanges often emerge naturally from these initial connections

Following orientation, new members are strongly encouraged to attend the next regular Connection Circle, where they'll deepen relationships with the wider community and continue exploring exchange possibilities.

## Success Indicators
- 80%+ of orientation participants complete membership process
- At least one commitment identified per new member
- Positive feedback on both clarity of information and quality of connections
- High percentage of new members attending subsequent Connection Circles
- First exchanges occurring within 60 days of orientation
