## Relationship to Onboarding

Connection Circles work in conjunction with the cohort-based New Member Orientation:

- New member cohorts attend orientation events that incorporate connection activities
- After orientation, they join regular Connection Circles as full community members
- Experienced members use Connection Circles to welcome newcomers and expand their exchange network
- Stewards monitor participation to ensure new members are successfully integrating

## Implementation Notes

### Facilitation Tips
- Use a talking piece to ensure equal speaking time
- Create a welcoming environment with comfortable seating arranged in a circle
- Provide simple refreshments (can be offered for credit)
- Use name tags if the group includes newer members
- Balance structure with organic conversation
- Consider a check-in/check-out format

### Prompts That Work Well
- "What's something you've been learning recently?"
- "What's a skill you'd like to develop?"
- "Share a time when someone in your community helped you."
- "What's something you enjoy doing that others might find valuable?"
- "What's a challenge you're facing that others might help with?"
- "What's an abundance in your life right now that you might share?"
- "What season-specific needs do you anticipate in the coming months?"
