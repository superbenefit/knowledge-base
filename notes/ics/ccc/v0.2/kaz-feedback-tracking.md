## Context from Conversation

### Key Points About Connection Circles/SIPs:

- Can be small groups but usually 1-to-1
- NOT monthly gatherings or organized groups
- Name changed to "Shared Interest Pairings (SIPs)" to avoid confusion

### Key Points About Hoarding:
- In mutual credit system, hoarding is beneficial
- Removes circulating supply
- Prevents system overload
- Creates buffer/slack in the system
- Different from traditional finance where hoarding creates scarcity

### Key Points About Pool Seeding:
- Pilot starts with commitments only
- Future cash entry would have controls
- Reference G-Future section for details
