# Community Exchange: Conflict Resolution Process

This document outlines how we'll address tensions, disagreements, and conflicts within the Community Exchange. A healthy community doesn't avoid conflictâ€”it develops thoughtful practices for understanding differences, finding common ground, and strengthening relationships through challenge.

## Guiding Principles

Our approach to conflict resolution is guided by these principles:

1. **Conflicts are natural and valuable**: They surface important learning and growth opportunities
2. **Early intervention**: Addressing tensions before they escalate
3. **Respect for all involved**: Maintaining dignity throughout the process
4. **Restoration over punishment**: Focus on healing relationships, not assigning blame
5. **Appropriate transparency**: Balancing privacy with community learning
6. **Multiple pathways**: Offering different approaches based on the situation

## Three-Tier Approach

The Community Exchange uses a three-tier approach to conflict resolution, with increasing levels of community involvement as needed:

### Tier 1: Direct Communication with Support

**For**: Misunderstandings, minor disagreements, unclear expectations

**Process**:
1. Any member experiencing tension contacts a steward to request support
2. The steward meets briefly with the requesting member to understand the situation
3. With agreement, the steward invites the other party to a facilitated conversation
4. The steward facilitates a structured dialogue using restorative practices
5. Together, the parties develop a resolution plan
6. The steward follows up after 2-4 weeks to check if the resolution is working

**Example Scenario**:
*Maria asked Jayden to help with her garden in exchange for 2 credits. Jayden spent two hours weeding but Maria felt the work wasn't thorough enough. Maria speaks with a steward, who facilitates a conversation where they clarify expectations and agree that Jayden will spend one more hour on specific areas, and Maria will provide clearer guidance about priorities.*

### Tier 2: Steward Panel Review

**For**: Repeated issues, unresolved Tier 1 conflicts, pattern concerns, credit disputes

**Process**:
1. When Tier 1 resolution doesn't resolve the issue, either party may request a panel review
2. A panel of three stewards (not including any previously involved) reviews the situation
3. The panel meets separately with each party to understand perspectives
4. The panel meets together to determine recommendations
5. The panel facilitates a meeting with both parties to present recommendations
6. If accepted, the recommendations are implemented with scheduled follow-up
7. If not accepted, the matter may move to Tier 3

**Example Scenario**:
*Over three months, four members report that Sam consistently cancels his committed services at the last minute. After unsuccessful direct conversations, a steward panel reviews the pattern. They discover Sam is overcommitted due to a recent job change. The panel recommends Sam temporarily reduce his offerings and develop a plan to fulfill existing commitments, with a steward checking in weekly for accountability.*

### Tier 3: Community Circle

**For**: Significant disagreements affecting multiple members, systemic issues, unresolved Tier 2 matters, potential removal of a member

**Process**:
1. The stewardship circle determines when an issue warrants community involvement
2. A special Community Circle is called with a neutral facilitator
3. The facilitator presents the situation (respecting privacy where appropriate)
4. Those directly involved share their perspectives
5. Community members offer observations and suggestions
6. The group works toward consensus on a resolution
7. The resolution is documented and implemented with clear accountability
8. The stewardship circle ensures follow-through

**Example Scenario**:
*A disagreement emerges about whether professional services should be valued at a higher credit rate than other contributions. After several Tier 2 attempts to resolve specific cases, the stewards recognize this as a systemic question. A Community Circle is called where members discuss the values of equality versus recognizing specialized skills. The community decides to maintain equal time-based valuation but create a new category for services requiring expensive equipment or materials.*

## Special Situations

### Credit Disputes

When conflicts involve credit exchanges or valuations:

1. The initial steward attempts to facilitate agreement between parties
2. If unresolved, a small panel reviews the exchange details and system precedents
3. The panel may:
   - Suggest a compromise valuation
   - Allocate credits from the community resilience fund to resolve the difference
   - Recommend revised credit valuations for similar future exchanges
   - Suggest improved documentation practices to prevent future disputes

### Unfulfilled Commitments

When a member fails to fulfill commitments:

1. The stewards reach out to understand the situation
2. A direct conversation between affected parties is facilitated
3. An alternative fulfillment plan is developed where possible
4. If a pattern emerges or resolution isn't possible:
   - The member's credit limit may be temporarily reduced
   - Future commitments may require additional backing or verification
   - In rare cases, the community may cover the commitment from the resilience fund

### Member Conduct Concerns

For concerns about behavior or conduct that undermines trust:

1. Direct conversation with the member about specific concerns
2. Clear articulation of community expectations and values
3. Co-created plan for alignment with community norms
4. If concerns persist, a limited participation period may be implemented
5. In severe or persistent cases, the community may decide to end the membership

## Membership Transitions

In rare cases, membership may need to end:

### Voluntary Exit
- Members may choose to leave at any time
- Exit process includes balancing credits where possible
- Exit interview to gather feedback
- Celebration of contributions made
- Option to return later following standard onboarding

### Involuntary Exit
- Considered only after multiple resolution attempts
- Requires Tier 3 community process with consensus decision
- Focus on dignified transition and community learning
- Credit balancing plan developed

## Prevention Strategies

We prevent many conflicts through:

### Clear Expectations
- Detailed onboarding materials
- Written community agreements
- Explicit exchange documentation
- Regular norm-setting discussions

### Relationship Building
- Regular Connection Circles focused on deepening understanding
- Skill-building in communication and feedback
- Appreciation practices that strengthen bonds
- Celebrating successful exchanges and collaborations

### Regular System Improvement
- Periodic review of common tension points
- System adjustments based on learnings
- Documentation of past resolutions as guidance
- Training for all members in collaborative communication

## Steward Responsibilities

Stewards play a crucial role in conflict resolution by:

- Remaining neutral when facilitating conversations
- Maintaining appropriate confidentiality
- Developing conflict resolution skills
- Documenting patterns and learnings
- Proposing system improvements based on recurring issues
- Modeling healthy conflict engagement

## Member Responsibilities

All members contribute to healthy conflict resolution by:

- Addressing concerns directly and promptly
- Speaking from personal experience rather than assumption
- Listening to understand rather than to respond
- Being open to different perspectives
- Following through on agreements
- Viewing conflicts as opportunities for community strengthening

## Documentation and Learning

We treat conflicts as learning opportunities by:

- Documenting resolutions (respecting privacy)
- Identifying system improvements based on patterns
- Periodically reviewing common tensions
- Sharing anonymized learnings with the whole community
- Revising this process based on experience

## Common Scenarios and Approaches

### Scenario 1: Quality Concerns
**Example**: A member receives a service but feels it doesn't meet expectations.
**Approach**: Facilitated conversation to clarify expectations, develop shared standards, and find a middle-ground solution.

### Scenario 2: Valuation Disagreements
**Example**: Members disagree about the credit value of a particular service.
**Approach**: Review of similar exchanges, community standards, and facilitated compromise, potentially updating guidelines for future clarity.

### Scenario 3: Time Constraints
**Example**: A member consistently delivers commitments late.
**Approach**: Explore underlying causes, adjust commitment levels if needed, develop accountability structures, and create more realistic timeframes.

### Scenario 4: Communication Styles
**Example**: Different communication preferences lead to misunderstandings.
**Approach**: Education about diverse communication styles, development of explicit agreements about preferred methods, and practice with facilitated conversations.

### Scenario 5: Credit Imbalances
**Example**: A member reaches their negative credit limit but needs additional services.
**Approach**: Review of barriers to contribution, development of new ways to contribute, and potential flexibility with temporary credit limit adjustments.

## Special Resources

The stewardship circle maintains:

- A roster of trained conflict facilitators (both within and beyond the community)
- Templates for conflict resolution meetings
- Documentation of previous resolutions (anonymized) for reference
- Training materials for developing conflict resolution skills
- Connections to external mediation resources for particularly complex situations

This process will evolve as we learn from experience. The stewardship circle will review and update these practices annually, with input from all members based on our collective experience.
