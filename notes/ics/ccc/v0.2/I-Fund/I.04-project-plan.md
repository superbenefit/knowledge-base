# Impact Yield Fund Project Plan

## LLM Continuation Prompt

```
This document outlines the project plan for developing the Impact Yield Fund (IYF), a financial structure that preserves capital while generating sustainable returns for investors and continuous support for community initiatives. 

As an LLM assistant, please help expand, refine, and advance this project plan based on the information provided in the I-Fund directory. Focus on creating practical, actionable steps that SuperBenefit can take to move from concept to implementation. Consider governance structures, technical requirements, legal considerations, and partnership development.

Your task is to help develop a comprehensive implementation strategy that addresses key questions:
1. What are the critical path items for moving the IYF from concept to pilot?
2. What specific technical infrastructure is needed?
3. What governance structure should be implemented?
4. How should the fund be pitched to potential investors like Boann Finance?
5. What measurement and evaluation frameworks will effectively demonstrate impact?

Please provide detailed, actionable advice that builds on the existing documentation.

## Project Overview

The Impact Yield Fund (IYF) project aims to develop, implement, and scale a novel funding mechanism that:
1. Preserves capital through low-risk DeFi strategies
2. Generates sustainable returns for investors (4-6%)
3. Directs excess yield to community impact initiatives
4. Creates a multiplier effect when integrated with commitment pools

## Project Phases & Timeline

### Phase 1: Discovery & Design (1-2 Months)
- [ ] Form dedicated working group with key stakeholders
- [ ] Define impact thesis and theory of change
- [ ] Research legal and regulatory requirements

4. [ ] Research legal requirements and potential structures
5. [ ] Begin drafting discussion paper for potential funders
6. [ ] Schedule regular working group meetings
7. [ ] Identify and engage technical partners
8. [ ] Create detailed project budget

## Pilot Implementation Plan

### Location
London, Ontario, Canada, in partnership with ICS

### Scope
- $3K BREAD seed capital
- 3-month duration
- Focus on local regenerative economy initiatives
- Integration with ICS programs

### Success Metrics
1. Economic multiplier: Commitments generated per dollar seeded
2. Community participation: Number of active participants
3. System stability: Governance effectiveness and protocol security

### Timeline
- Month 1: Setup and onboarding
- Month 2-3: Active operation
- Month 3: Impact assessment and report

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Protocol Security:** Ensure thorough audits and multiple security reviews
- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:** Implement rigorous testing procedures
- **Market Volatility:** Focus on stable, conservative yield strategies

### Operational Risks
- **Governance Challenges:** Establish clear decision-making processes
- **Skill Gaps:** Identify required expertise and fill knowledge gaps
- **Resource Constraints:** Secure adequate funding for development

### Regulatory Risks
- **Legal Uncertainty:** Engage legal experts early in the process
- **Compliance Issues:** Maintain open dialogue with regulatory bodies
- **Tax Implications:** Consider tax treatment for various stakeholders

## Success Criteria

The Impact Yield Fund project will be considered successful if:

1. The technical infrastructure is secure, audited, and functional
2. The governance structure is transparent and effective
3. The pilot demonstrates measurable community impact
4. Institutional investors express interest in the model
5. The fund can scale beyond the initial pilot
