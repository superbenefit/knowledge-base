# Impact Yield Fund Diagrams and Visuals

This document references and explains the key diagrams illustrating the Impact Yield Fund concept.

## 1. Yield Fund High Level

This diagram illustrates the basic structure of the yield fund:

- **Investors** contribute capital to the fund
- **Capital Allocation Mechanism** directs funding to appropriate DeFi products
- **DeFi products** generate yield from the capital
- The yield is allocated between investors and impact initiatives
- Capital can be withdrawn when needed (with appropriate redemption windows)

This high-level view shows the separation between yield generation and yield allocation.

## 2. SuperBenefit Impact Fund Value Flows (Simplified)

This more detailed diagram shows:

- **SuperBenefit** as the fund administrator
- **SUPERBENEFIT FUND** as the main smart contract holding the capital
- **Capital Allocation Mechanism** directing funds to institutional-grade DeFi products
- **Yield Allocation Mechanism** distributing returns:
  - 90-92% of yield returns to investors
  - 2% of yield supports the network
  - Excess yield funds the Impact Treasury

The diagram demonstrates how corporate funders/foundations/endowments provide capital which generates sustainable returns while supporting community impact.

## 3. Breadchain Value Flows

This diagram shows a parallel model implemented by Breadchain Co-op:

- **Breadchain Co-op** as the governing entity
- **Holders of BREAD** as the investors/members
- **Breadchain Smart Contracts** handling yield generation
- **xDAI** protocols creating stable returns
- **Yield Allocation based on opt-in & community votes** directing funding to projects

This model provides inspiration for a cooperative approach to impact fund governance.

## 4. SB Impact Fund Value Flows (Comprehensive)

This comprehensive diagram shows:

- The complete flow from co-steading fund partners through yield generation to impact allocation
- The integration with the Reimagining Power Project
- Impact measurement and reporting feedback loops
- Convening and coordination mechanisms
- The relationship with various RPP initiatives

This view provides the full ecosystem perspective on how the Impact Yield Fund connects to broader regenerative finance work.
