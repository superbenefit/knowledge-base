# Impact Yield Fund Overview

## Project Definition

The Impact Yield Fund (IYF) is a novel financial structure that preserves capital while generating sustainable returns for investors and continuous support for community initiatives. The fund directs excess yield from secure DeFi protocols to support impactful social and environmental projects.

## Discussion Paper Development

The next major milestone is developing a comprehensive discussion paper (7-8 pages) that articulates:
- What an Impact Yield Fund is and how it works (6 pages)
- The compelling case for this approach at this moment
- Benefits for all stakeholders
- Technical implementation details
- Risk analysis and mitigation strategies
- Pilot implementation plan
- Potential application with Community Exchange (1 page max)
- Clear next steps for interested partners (0.5 page)

## Potential Applications

The Impact Yield Fund is designed to support various types of social impact initiatives. One possible application (to be discussed briefly at the end of the paper) is supporting Community Exchange Commitment Pools. Other potential applications include:

1. **Environmental Restoration**: Funding habitat restoration and conservation
2. **Social Enterprise**: Supporting impact-focused businesses
3. **Education**: Funding scholarships and educational programs
4. **Food Security**: Supporting sustainable agriculture initiatives
5. **Digital Commons**: Maintaining open-source infrastructure

## Current Status

The fund concept has been developed and discussed internally at SuperBenefit and with potential partners. Initial conversations with Boann Finance indicate potential interest in this approach. The next steps are:

1. Creating a formal discussion paper for potential funders
2. Finalizing the technical architecture
3. Developing a small-scale pilot in London, Ontario
4. Establishing the governance framework
5. Creating the legal structure

## Resources Needed

To advance this project, SuperBenefit needs:
- Technical development capacity
- Legal expertise in financial structures and securities
- Governance design input
- Impact measurement framework
- Marketing and communication support
