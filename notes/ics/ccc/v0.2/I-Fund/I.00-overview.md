# Impact Yield Fund Overview

## Project Definition

The Impact Yield Fund (IYF) is a novel financial structure that preserves capital while generating sustainable returns for investors and continuous support for community initiatives. By connecting stable yield generation with community exchange pools, we create a multiplier effect where each dollar generates 5-10x its value in local economic activity.

## Key Documents

This directory contains the following resources for understanding and implementing the Impact Yield Fund:

1. **[I-Fund-README.md](./I-Fund-README.md)** - Directory overview and introduction
2. **[I.01-impact-yield-fund-concept.md](./I.01-impact-yield-fund-concept.md)** - Detailed explanation of the fund concept
3. **[I.02-meeting-notes.md](./I.02-meeting-notes.md)** - Compilation of relevant meeting discussions
4. **[I.03-diagrams-and-visuals.md](./I.03-diagrams-and-visuals.md)** - Visual representations of the fund structure
5. **[I.04-project-plan.md](./I.04-project-plan.md)** - Implementation roadmap and action items
6. **[I.05-discussion-paper-outline.md](./I.05-discussion-paper-outline.md)** - Structure for formal presentation to funders

## Discussion Paper Development

The next major milestone is developing a comprehensive discussion paper (5-7 pages) that articulates:
- What an Impact Yield Fund is and how it works
- The compelling case for this approach at this moment
- Benefits for all stakeholders
- Technical implementation details
- Risk analysis and mitigation strategies
- Pilot implementation plan
- Integration with Community Exchange
- Clear next steps for interested partners

## Connection to Community Exchange

While the Impact Yield Fund and Community Exchange Commitment Pools are distinct projects that can be pursued independently, they have significant synergistic potential:

1. **Yield Allocation**: The excess yield from the fund can seed community exchange pools
2. **Multiplier Effect**: Each dollar of yield supports 5-10x its value in community exchange commitments
3. **Cumulative Growth**: Year-over-year yield allocation creates growing capacity for exchanges
4. **Impact Measurement**: On-chain attestations from exchanges provide verification for the fund

This complementary relationship creates a virtuous cycle where financial returns generate social impact that can be transparently tracked and measured.

## Current Status

The fund concept has been developed and discussed internally at SuperBenefit and with potential partners. Initial conversations with Boann Finance indicate potential interest in this approach. The next steps are:

1. Creating a formal discussion paper for potential funders
2. Finalizing the technical architecture
3. Developing a small-scale pilot in London, Ontario
4. Establishing the governance framework
5. Creating the legal structure

## Resources Needed

To advance this project, SuperBenefit needs:
- Technical development capacity
- Legal expertise in financial structures and securities
- Governance design input
- Impact measurement framework
- Marketing and communication support
