# Community Exchange: Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the Community Exchange documentation. These definitions align with the framework described in "Grassroots Economics: Reflection and Practice" while adapting to our local context.

## Core Concepts

**Community Exchange** - Our local system combining Connection Circles and Commitment Pooling to enable resource sharing and community building outside the conventional money economy.

**Connection Circles** - Community gatherings where people share what they want to learn and what they can teach or offer, building relationships and identifying community resources.

**Commitment Pool** - A shared system where members formalize offers of goods and services, which can be exchanged using credits.

**Credit** - The unit of account within our system. One credit represents approximately 30 minutes of time or $10 of value, though this is a guideline rather than a strict rule.

**Commitment** - A promise to provide a specific good or service to the community pool, which can be claimed by other members. When fulfilled, the provider earns credits.

**Pool** - The common space (digital or conceptual) where commitments are aggregated and tracked, allowing members to give and receive value.

**Steward** - A member with additional responsibilities for managing the system, including onboarding new members, maintaining records, and facilitating community processes.

## Protocol Functions

**Curation** - The process of determining which commitments can enter the pool. In our system, this is managed by stewards who ensure offerings align with community values.

**Valuation** - The process of determining the relative value of different commitments (e.g., 1 hour of childcare = 2 credits).

**Limitation** - Boundaries set to maintain system health, such as credit limits (maximum 10 credits per person) and expiration periods (credits expire after 3 months of inactivity).

**Exchange** - The process of giving and receiving commitments through the pool, facilitated by the credit system.

## Operational Terms

**Connection Circle** - A gathering where members share skills, interests, and needs, forming the relational foundation of the exchange.

**Credit Balance** - The number of credits a member currently holds, reflecting their contributions to the community minus what they've received.

**Credit Limit** - The maximum number of credits a member can hold (10) or owe (-10) at any given time.

**Expiration** - Credits expire after 3 months of inactivity to encourage circulation and prevent hoarding.

**Ledger** - The record-keeping system (initially Google Sheets, later Sarafu.Network) that tracks all commitments, exchanges, and credit balances.

**Mutual Credit** - A system where credits are created when members provide goods or services to others, and spent when receiving them.

**Sarafu.Network** - The digital platform we plan to transition to for managing our commitment pool (Phase 2).

**Stewardship Circle** - The group of members responsible for facilitating the Community Exchange system.

## Related Concepts

**Commons** - Resources that are shared and governed by a community rather than owned privately or by the state.

**Demurrage** - A mechanism (like expiration) that encourages the circulation rather than hoarding of credits.

**Mutual Aid** - A form of political participation in which people take responsibility for caring for one another and changing political conditions.

**Reciprocity** - The practice of exchanging things with others for mutual benefit.

**Resilience** - The capacity to recover quickly from difficulties; in economics, the ability to adapt to changing conditions while maintaining core functions.

**Rotating Labor Association (ROLA)** - A traditional practice where community members take turns helping each other with labor-intensive tasks.
