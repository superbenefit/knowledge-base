## Commitment Valuation Guidelines

While we've provided suggested credit values for each commitment, these are guidelines, not strict rules. When adding your commitments to the pool, consider:

- **Skill level required**: More specialized skills may warrant higher credit values
- **Time required**: More time-intensive offerings may warrant higher credit values
- **Material costs**: If you're providing materials, factor this into the credit value
- **Market comparison**: What might this cost in the conventional economy?
- **Personal value**: What feels fair to you?

All credit valuations will be reviewed by stewards to ensure general fairness and consistency. The community may periodically review valuation standards to address emerging patterns or concerns.
