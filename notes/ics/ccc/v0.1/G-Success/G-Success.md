## Using Success Metrics

Success metrics should be:
1. Tracked consistently over time
2. Shared transparently with the community
3. Used to inform system improvements
4. Balanced between quantitative measures (number of exchanges, credit flow) and qualitative indicators (member satisfaction, community cohesion)

Remember that the ultimate goal of the Community Exchange is to strengthen community resilience, build relationships, and create a thriving local economy based on mutual support and care.
