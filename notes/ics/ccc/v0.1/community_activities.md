4. One or two specialized activities based on community interest

### Expanding Activities
As the community grows and the system matures, gradually add:
1. More specialized activities based on member interests and needs
2. Increased frequency of popular events
3. Member-initiated activities supported by the system

### Supporting New Initiatives
To encourage member-led activities:
1. Create a simple proposal form for new activities
2. Offer mentoring from experienced event organizers
3. Provide credit support for first-time organizers
4. Document successful events for future replication

## Activity Support Resources

To support these activities, we will develop:
1. Facilitation guides for each recurring event
2. Templates for promotion and communication
3. Evaluation tools to gather feedback
4. Documentation systems to capture learning
