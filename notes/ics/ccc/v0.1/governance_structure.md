# Community Exchange: Governance Structure

This document outlines how decisions are made, who makes them, and the responsibilities of various roles within the Community Exchange system.

## Core Principles of Governance

The Community Exchange is governed according to these principles:

1. **Distributed Leadership**: Authority and responsibility are shared rather than concentrated
2. **Consent-Based Decision Making**: We seek consent (absence of objections) rather than consensus (everyone agrees)
3. **Transparency**: Decision-making processes and records are visible to all members
4. **Subsidiarity**: Decisions are made at the most local level possible
5. **Continuous Learning**: Governance evolves based on experience and feedback
6. **Service**: Leadership positions are viewed as service to the community

## Stewardship Circle

The primary governance body of the Community Exchange is the Stewardship Circle.

### Composition
- Initially 3-5 founding members
- Eventually 5-7 members representing diverse perspectives and skills
- New stewards are nominated by existing stewards or community members

### Selection Process
- Initial stewards are founding members who volunteer
- Future stewards are selected based on:
  - Demonstrated commitment to community values
  - Active participation in the system
  - Complementary skills and perspectives
  - Willingness to serve

### Term
- No fixed term limits
- Quarterly check-in on capacity and commitment
- Annual renewal of intent to serve
- Stewards can step down at any time with notice

### Responsibilities
1. **System Maintenance**:
   - Managing the ledger system
   - Tracking credits and exchanges
   - Ensuring system integrity
   - Monitoring system health

2. **Member Support**:
   - Onboarding new members
   - Supporting members in using the system
   - Facilitating connections between members
   - Addressing questions and concerns

3. **Community Building**:
   - Organizing Connection Circle gatherings
   - Facilitating community celebrations
   - Ensuring inclusive participation
   - Maintaining communication channels

4. **Decision Making**:
   - Developing and refining policies
   - Addressing conflicts and challenges
   - Evolving the system based on experience
   - Making day-to-day operational decisions

5. **External Relations**:
   - Representing the system to other communities
   - Connecting with allied initiatives
   - Sharing learnings and best practices
   - Exploring partnerships and collaborations

### Meeting Rhythm
- Weekly operational check-ins (30 minutes)
- Monthly strategic sessions (2 hours)
- Quarterly retrospectives and planning (half-day)
- Annual vision and review session (full day)

### Decision-Making Process
1. **Proposal**: Any steward can bring a proposal to the circle
2. **Clarifying Questions**: Understanding the proposal fully
3. **Reactions**: Brief, non-binding reactions to the proposal
4. **Amendments**: The proposer may amend based on reactions
5. **Objections**: Stewards raise objections if the proposal would cause harm
6. **Integration**: Working through objections to improve the proposal
7. **Consent**: When no objections remain, the proposal is adopted

### Documentation
- All stewardship circle meetings are documented
- Decision records are maintained and visible to all members
- Policy changes are communicated proactively to the community

## Working Groups

For specific projects or ongoing operational needs, the Stewardship Circle may establish Working Groups.

### Formation Process
1. Stewardship Circle identifies need for a Working Group
2. Call for participants goes out to all members
3. Interested members join (no approval needed for participation)
4. Group establishes its own rhythm and process
5. Regular reports back to Stewardship Circle

### Example Working Groups
- Technology Implementation
- New Member Onboarding
- Community Events
- Conflict Resolution
- External Communications

### Authority
- Working Groups have autonomy within their domain
- Major decisions or changes come back to Stewardship Circle for consent
- Working Groups are temporary unless established as ongoing

## All-Member Governance

Certain decisions require input from all members:

### Decision Categories
1. **Major System Changes**:
   - Significant changes to credit policies
   - Technology platform changes
   - Fundamental purpose or direction shifts

2. **Stewardship Selection**:
   - Affirming new stewards
   - Addressing concerns about current stewards

3. **Community Vision**:
   - Annual direction setting
   - Long-term planning

### Process for All-Member Decisions
1. Proposal development (by Stewardship Circle or Working Group)
2. Written proposal shared with all members
3. Discussion period (in-person or online)
4. Gathering feedback and concerns
5. Proposal refinement
6. Final decision by consent (absence of significant objections)

### Meeting Structure
- Quarterly all-member gatherings
- Special assemblies for urgent matters
- Online options for those who cannot attend in person
- Facilitated by stewards or designated facilitators

## Role-Specific Responsibilities

### Steward Roles
The Stewardship Circle may designate specific responsibilities among its members:

### Member Responsibilities

All members share these governance responsibilities:

1. Participate in quarterly all-member gatherings
2. Provide feedback on system functioning
3. Vote on major decisions when required
4. Consider serving in Working Groups or the Stewardship Circle
5. Uphold community agreements and values

## Conflict Resolution

See separate "Conflict Resolution Process" document for detailed procedures.

### Key Principles
- Address conflicts early and directly
- Focus on needs and system improvement, not blame
- Use graduated approach for resolution
- Document outcomes and learnings
- Use conflicts as opportunities to improve the system

## Compensation

- Stewards may receive credits for their service (e.g., 2 credits/month)
- Working Group members may receive credits for substantial contributions
- All compensation is transparent and recorded in the ledger

## Evolution of Governance

This governance structure will evolve as the community grows and learns. The Stewardship Circle will facilitate a formal review of governance:
- After the first 3 months of operation
- At the 6-month mark
- Annually thereafter
