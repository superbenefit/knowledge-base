# Commitment Showcase

## Purpose
To highlight available commitments, inspire new offerings, increase visibility of the Exchange's resources, and encourage creative commitment development.

## Overview
The Commitment Showcase is a dynamic, presentation-based event that brings commitments to life through storytelling, demonstration, and dialogue. Unlike static listings in a directory, these showcases allow members to share the context, motivation, and details behind their offerings, making them more visible and appealing to potential exchange partners. By regularly featuring different commitments, these events help the community discover hidden resources, recognize member talents, and identify creative ways to meet collective needs. They also provide a supportive space for members to develop new commitments based on community feedback.
