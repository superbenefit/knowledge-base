Throughout 2024, we've observed several noteworthy trends and outcomes from our waste reduction initiatives that extend beyond the quantitative metrics already reported.

One encouraging development has been the shift in participant attitudes toward repair and reuse. Many first-time attendees express surprise at what can be fixed, with several commenting they're shocked by the possibilities and pledging to change their behaviours regarding the disposal of broken items. This suggests our programs are successfully fostering a cultural shift away from throwaway habits toward more sustainable practices. We've seen this shift manifest in practical ways, with some regular attendees returning to multiple events and even evolving from participants to volunteers.

An unexpected outcome has been the community building among our volunteer fixers and helpers. A sense of camaraderie has developed among these individuals who share a passion for sustainability and service. This community of practice continues to grow organically, with existing volunteers inviting friends with relevant skills to join our efforts. The result is an expanding network of environmentally conscious citizens who are actively engaged in making London more sustainable through direct action.

We've also witnessed cross-pollination between our programs, with Thing Library users attending Repair Cafés and vice versa. This suggests we're building a broader community of practice around sustainable living rather than just operating isolated services.

While we're pleased with these outcomes, we've identified areas for improvement in our operations. The Repair Café events experience challenges in managing wait times and communicating effectively with attendees who are waiting for assistance. We're developing improved processes for future events to address these operational challenges.

As we move forward, we're exploring opportunities to further develop our volunteer training program to enhance the consistency and quality of repairs. We're also considering more frequent events to meet the growing demand and reduce wait times. Additionally, we plan to strengthen our data collection methods to better capture the full environmental and social impact of our initiatives.

The lessons from this year's programming have positioned us to further scale our impact while maintaining the inclusive, community centred approach that has proven so effective for the past seven years.
