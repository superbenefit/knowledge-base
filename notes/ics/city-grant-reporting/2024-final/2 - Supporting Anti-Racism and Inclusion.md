# How has the project supported anti-racism anti-oppression, diversity, equity and inclusion?

Our waste reduction initiatives have built inclusion and accessibility into their core design through several practical approaches that reduce barriers to participation for diverse community members.

Geographic accessibility has been a central focus of our programming. By hosting Repair Caf√© events at library branches in various corners of London, we've deliberately brought our services to diverse neighbourhoods rather than expecting residents to travel downtown. This approach recognizes the transportation barriers many face, particularly those without personal vehicles. As one participant noted, "bringing broken heavy stuff on a bus, while towing kids along, is not realistic for many." Our rotating locations have enabled participation from individuals and families across different communities who might otherwise be excluded from centralized services.

All our events are held in physically accessible venues to ensure that persons with mobility challenges can participate fully. The London Public Library locations provide reliable, barrier-free spaces that are already familiar to many community members, reducing the intimidation factor that sometimes accompanies new programs.

Financial accessibility has been ensured by making all events completely free of charge, including refreshments. This no-cost approach eliminates economic barriers that might otherwise prevent participation from low-income individuals and families. With the rising cost of living affecting many Londoners, our commitment to free programming has become increasingly important for ensuring equitable access.

Our volunteer team reflects the diversity of London's community, bringing varied perspectives and experiences to our work. We benefit from the contributions of individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds, age groups, and genders who share a commitment to sustainability and community service.

The open, collaborative atmosphere at our events fosters cross-cultural connections and exchanges. The universal experience of broken items and the satisfaction of successful repairs creates common ground that transcends differences in background or identity. Participants routinely engage with others they might not otherwise meet in their daily lives, building understanding and relationships across cultural and social divides.

Through these practical measures, we've created inclusive spaces where diverse community members can access services, share skills, and connect with others in meaningful ways.
