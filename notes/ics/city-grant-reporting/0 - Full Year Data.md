## Demographics

### Estimated Full-Year Demographics (2024)

| Age Group | Mid-Year Count | Full-Year Estimate | % Change |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| Children (0-12) | 40 | 68 | +70.0% |
| Youth (13-25) | 73 | 144 | +97.3% |
| Adults (26-64) | 348 | 567 | +62.9% |
| Older Adults (65+) | 148 | 188 | +27.0% |
| **TOTAL unique individuals** | 609 | 967 | +58.8% |
| Total families | 25 | 51 | +104.0% |

### Demographic Calculation Methodology

These estimates were calculated by analyzing:

1. **Program-specific growth patterns:**
   - Repair Café: 41.9% increase from mid-year
   - Thing Library: 25.0% increase from mid-year
   - Workshops: 191.0% increase from mid-year

2. **Different demographic distributions across programs:**
   - Repair Café: Higher proportion of older adults and adults
   - Thing Library: Primarily adult users
   - Workshops: Higher proportion of youth, children, and families

3. **Activity distribution between first and second half:**
   - Repair Café had more activity in the first half (67%)
   - Workshops had substantially more activity in the second half
   - Thing Library had consistent attendance with slight growth

4. **Overlap adjustment:**
   - Applied a 15-20% overlap factor to account for individuals who participated in multiple programs

The significant increase in youth (+97.3%) and families (+104.0%) reflects the successful expansion of workshop programming in the second half of the year, which tends to attract more students and families. The moderate growth in older adults (+27.0%) aligns with the Repair Café's steady appeal to seniors.

## Metrics

- Londoners learning about waste reduction: 1,137 (Repair Café + Workshops + Thing Library)
- Londoners learning about climate-smart practices: 1,137 (Repair Café + Workshops + Thing Library)

- Waste diversion participants: +68.8% (from 520)
- Waste reduction learners: +86.7% (from 609)
- Climate-smart learners: +86.7% (from 609)

## Calculation Methodology

- **Items brought in**: Counted items with triage numbers, fixer information, or documented status
- **Items repaired**: Counted items with "fixed" or "partial fix" status, plus estimated fixes for items without status (using the same fix rate)
- **Attendee estimate**: Applied the ratio from mid-year report (520 attendees : 392 items brought = 1.33) with a slight conservative adjustment (1.26)
- **Program metrics**: Calculated by combining attendance figures from relevant programs (without additional overlap adjustment)
