# How has the project impacted the identified equity denied groups?

Throughout 2024, our Waste Reduction Initiatives have made meaningful impacts on equity-denied groups through our accessible programming and community approach.

For older adults, the Repair Café has become a valuable social outlet, providing opportunities to share skills and knowledge accumulated over a lifetime. Many seniors attend regularly, bringing cherished items for repair and expressing joy at having treasured possessions restored to working order. The program creates meaningful intergenerational connections and helps combat social isolation that many older adults experience. As one regular participant noted, it's "great for social outings for older folks" while providing a service that helps them preserve items with sentimental value.

In the current challenging financial climate, our free repair service has particularly benefited persons with low income. The Repair Café offers a practical solution for extending the life of household items without the expense of professional repair services or replacement costs. Participants frequently express gratitude for the money saved through our services, which has become increasingly important as the cost of living continues to rise.

For newcomers to London, the Repair Café has served as a welcoming point of connection with the broader community. The shared experience of fixing things transcends language barriers and creates natural opportunities for interaction and belonging. Newcomers have found the program helps them "connect with the community and feel at home in a new place," offering both practical assistance and social integration. The library locations also introduce them to other community resources and services.

While women remain underrepresented among our volunteer fixers, we have seen a small but growing number of women stepping into these roles, providing important representation that inspires others. Many female attendees have reported feeling empowered by learning repair skills that have traditionally been male-dominated. The program's volunteer team and organizational leadership is predominantly female, helping to create a welcoming environment for women and girls.

Our rotating locations across different London neighbourhoods have been crucial in making our services accessible to diverse communities, especially for those relying on public transportation or those with mobility challenges who find it difficult to travel across the city with broken items.
