# ICS Experiment Reflection - DRAFT

## Setting the Context

### Reflection scope
- **Period covered**: January 2025 - July 8, 2025 (ICS Experiment implementation phase as part of the Reimagining Power Project)
- **Events/phases**: Governance infrastructure setup, GreenPill chapter application and launch, hypercert development, onboarding workshop design

### Original intentions
From the experiment scoping document, the four key activities were:
1. **Establishing Governance Infrastructure**: Setting up decentralized tools (multisig wallet, ENS domain, Hats Protocol roles, Snapshot space, CharmVerse, SuperBenefit integration)
2. **Minting Hypercerts for the Repair Café**: Documenting environmental and social impact through blockchain-based hypercerts
3. **Launching a Green Pill Network Local Chapter**: Establishing GPN chapter in London, Ontario
4. **Onboarding Contributors to Web3**: Developing and piloting an onboarding workshop

### Participants
- **Core participants**: 
  - Heenal (ICS lead)
  - Rathermercurial (RPP technical support)
  - Michelle Baldwin (RPP participant)
  - Filsan Farah (RPP participant)
  - Lliam Buckley (local artist/technologist, GreenPill network connection)
- **Contributors**: ICS members, volunteers, workshop participants
- **Stakeholders**: SuperBenefit, Open Civics, Green Pill communities

### Reflection trigger
- Reporting deadline for OTF (Ontario Trillium Foundation) grant - $100,000 grant which was majority funding for the project
- All promised deliverables completed, though some implementation plan items not fully executed
- Project not finished but at a reporting milestone
