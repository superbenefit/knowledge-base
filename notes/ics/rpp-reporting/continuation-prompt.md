# Continuation Prompt for ICS Experiment Reflection Interview

## Context
This prompt is for continuing an interrupted interview session to complete the ICS Experiment Reflection document for the Reimagining Power Project (RPP). The reflection document will serve as source material for an LLM to generate the final ICS experiment report.

## Current Status
- **Date**: [Insert current date when using this prompt]
- **Previous session**: An interview was in progress with Heenal to fill in missing information for the reflection document
- **Progress**: Initial draft created with gaps identified and marked as [NEED INFO]

## File Locations
- **Main reflection draft**: `/Users/heenal/Documents/GitHub/knowledge-base/notes/ics/rpp-reporting/ics-experiment-reflection-draft.md`
- **Original template**: The attached file "ICS Experiment Reflections (1).md"
- **Background documents**:
  - `/Users/heenal/Documents/GitHub/knowledge-base/notes/ics/about/ics-experiment-scoping.md`
  - `/Users/heenal/Documents/GitHub/knowledge-base/notes/ics/about/ics-implementation-plan.md`
  - `/Users/heenal/Documents/GitHub/knowledge-base/notes/ics/about/ics-discovery-report.md`

## Interview Approach
1. Review the draft reflection document to see what sections have been completed
2. Continue the interview from where it left off, focusing on sections marked [NEED INFO]
3. Ask concise, specific questions rather than requesting flowing prose
4. Update the draft document as information is provided
5. Keep responses brief and factual - this is source material, not final prose

## Sections Requiring Information (as of initial draft):
1. **Context**: Specific dates, participant names, reflection trigger
2. **Implementation Status**: Status of various governance tools, participant numbers
3. **GreenPill Chapter**: Application timeline, meeting details, governance structure
4. **Hypercert**: Data collection, minting status, platform used
5. **Web3 Onboarding**: Workshop development, pilot details, participant feedback
6. **Surprises and Discoveries**: All subsections need input
7. **Stakeholder Experiences**: All subsections need input
8. **Progress Against Intentions**: Status updates on challenges and metrics
9. **Challenges and Responses**: Specific obstacles and how they were addressed
10. **Patterns and Insights**: Learnings and transferable principles
11. **Next Steps**: Future plans based on experiment outcomes

## Instructions for Continuing
1. Start by asking: "Where did we leave off in the ICS reflection interview?"
2. Review the draft document to identify which sections have been updated
3. Continue with the next set of unanswered questions
4. Update the draft document after each set of responses
5. Save progress regularly to the same file location
6. When complete, notify that the reflection is ready for final report generation

## Key Reminders
- Heenal is both the facilitator and the primary implementer being interviewed
- This is not the final report - just source material
- Focus on capturing facts, experiences, and insights rather than polished writing
- The goal is completeness over eloquence
