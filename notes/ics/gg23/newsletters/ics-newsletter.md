# ICS Newsletter: Help Us Build Bridges Between Community Sustainability and Web3

![ICS Logo or Repair CafÃ© image]

Dear ICS Community,

**We Need Your Help!** ðŸŒ±

For the past 6 years, we've been building community sustainability programs in London - from our Repair CafÃ© (which has diverted over 1,000kg from landfill this year alone) to our Thing Library (saving our community $14,000+ through shared resources).

**Today, we're asking for a small favor that would make a big impact on our long-term sustainability.**

## A New Funding Approach

The Institute for Community Sustainability is participating in Gitcoin Grants Round 23 - a special funding opportunity that uses "quadratic funding" to make small donations incredibly powerful.

**Here's why this matters for our future:**
- This funding approach prioritizes community support over large donors
- It provides a sustainable way to fund our ongoing programs
- It connects our work to a global network of regenerative initiatives

## What We're Building

We see the intersection of community sustainability and web3 as key to our long-term resilience. We're exploring how these new tools can:

1. Create more transparent governance for our programs
2. Verify and communicate our environmental impact
3. Connect our local work to global regenerative networks

We've already made significant progress, including launching a Green Pill London chapter (more info coming soon!) and participating in the Reimagining Power Project exploring how web3 can transform social impact. [Read our article on this work here](https://pub.superbenefit.org/reimagining-power-how-web3-can-transform-social-impact).

## Help Us With Just $2-20

**The amazing thing about this funding model:** Even a small donation of $2-20 significantly improves our matching funds! The number of supporters matters more than the amount.

**It's super easy to support us:**
- **Credit Card/PayPal:** [YOUR PAYPAL LINK] (No crypto knowledge needed!)
- **Web3 Option:** [https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/31/52](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/31/52)

## Please Donate Now!

This funding round closes on April 16th, and your support would mean the world to us. After thousands of volunteer hours building these community programs, your small contribution helps ensure we can continue this important work.

**Can you spare $2-20 to help us reach our goal of 50 supporters?**
