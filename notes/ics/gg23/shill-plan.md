# GG23 Streamlined Shill Plan
*A focused 3-day strategy for the final push*

## Campaign Goals
- 50+ unique donations
- $1,000+ total raised
- Rank in top 25% of projects

## High-Impact Focus Areas

### 1. Personal Connections (Highest ROI)
Personal outreach converts at 5-10x the rate of general posts. Focus here first.

**Action Steps:**
- Create a list of 15-20 close contacts who are already familiar with your work
- Send personalized messages mentioning your shared connection to the work
- Follow up once with those who expressed interest but haven't donated

**Template:**
```
Hey [Name],

I hope you're well! I wanted to reach out about something important to me - the Institute for Community Sustainability is participating in Gitcoin Grants Round 23, which uses quadratic funding to support public goods.

Our submission highlights the work we're doing to bridge local sustainability (our Repair CafÃ©, Thing Library) with web3 regenerative tools. Even small donations (literally $1-5) help significantly because of the matching calculation.

Would you consider making a small contribution before [date]? The link is:

Thanks for considering! Let me know if you have any questions.

[Your name]
```

### 2. High-Value Community Groups
Focus only on 3-5 most relevant groups where you already have relationships.

**Priority Groups:**
- SuperBenefit Discord/Telegram
- GreenPill Toronto/Global
- ReFi DAO channels
- Ethereum Localism groups

**Template:**
```
Friends, I'd appreciate your support for our GG23 application highlighting the Institute for Community Sustainability's work as a local ReFi node.

We're building bridges between grassroots sustainability work (Repair CafÃ©s, Thing Library) and web3 regenerative coordination - documenting our journey and sharing patterns with the broader ecosystem.

Even $1-5 donations help tremendously with the matching calculation! Link: https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/31/52

Thank you! ðŸŒ±
```

### 3. X/Twitter Strategy (Simplified)
Create 3-5 compelling tweets that are easy for supporters to retweet.

**Sample Tweets:**
1. Core ask tweet
2. Impact metrics tweet (highlighting Repair CafÃ©/Thing Library stats)
3. "Why This Matters" tweet connecting local work to global ReFi
4. Progress update midway
5. Final call with urgency

## Daily Focus Plan

### Day 1: Foundation
- Draft personal messages to 15 closest allies
- Post in SuperBenefit and one other core community
- Share first tweet with your team/close supporters

### Day 2: Expand
- Message 5-10 additional contacts
- Post in 2-3 more community groups
- Share progress update on Twitter
- Ask team members to each contact 3-5 people

### Day 3: Final Push
- Follow up with interested but uncommitted supporters
- Post "last chance" messages in all channels
- Share final appeal tweet
- Send thank you notes to those who've already supported

## What to Skip (For Now)
- Multiple Discord servers
- X/Twitter Spaces
- Physical outreach materials
- Complex incentive programs
- Overwhelming yourself with too many channels

## Remember
- Quality > Quantity
- Authenticity > Polish
- Personal > Broadcast
- Something > Nothing

The most powerful thing you can do is simply tell people why this matters to you personally and ask directly for their support. Trust that your existing relationships and the value of your work will carry this campaign forward.
