# Website Review and Recommendations

After reviewing the ICS website (communitysustainability.ca), here are my observations and recommendations:

## Overall Observations:

1. **Current, Well-Maintained Content**: The website appears to be up-to-date with recent events (Fall 2024 schedule) and has current information about programs.

2. **Missing Web3 Section**: As you noted, there is no content about your web3 initiatives, which represents a significant gap given your current direction.

3. **Good Program Structure**: The three main programs (Thing Library, Repair Café, Workshops & Events) are clearly presented.

4. **Inconsistent Navigation**: Some pages have full navigation while others have limited options.

## Specific Recommendations:

### 1. Add Web3/Regenerative Finance Section
- Create a new main page using the content I've drafted
- Add this to the main navigation alongside your other programs
- Ensure it's linked from the homepage under "Current Programs"

### 2. Update Date Information
- Some dates on the Repair Café page show "Winter 2025" events but include dates like February 26, March 26, etc. which would be 2026 (not 2025) since we're already in April 2025. This should be verified and corrected.

### 3. GG23 Campaign Promotion
- Add a prominent banner or section on the homepage about your GG23 campaign
- Include direct donation links for both web3 and traditional payment options
- Consider a countdown timer to create urgency (campaign ends April 16)

### 4. Strategic Plan Updates
- The strategic plan is referred to as a "draft" in multiple places - if it's been finalized, update this language
- Ensure the most current version is linked

### 5. Cross-Program Integration
- Add mentions of your web3 exploration in the Repair Café and Thing Library pages to show integration
- For example, mention impact tracking and verification for the Repair Café

### 6. Mobile Responsiveness
- Test how the site appears on mobile devices, particularly the tables and event listings
- Ensure donation links are easy to tap on mobile

### 7. Call to Action Improvement
- Make donation CTAs more prominent with action-oriented language
- Consider a persistent "Support Us" button in the navigation
- Add a simple explanation of quadratic funding next to donation links

### 8. Content Opportunities
- Add testimonials from community members who have used your services
- Create a "Resources" section with links to articles, the SuperBenefit knowledge base, etc.
- Consider adding an explicit "Support Us" page with various ways to help

## Implementation Priority:

1. **Immediate (For GG23 Campaign)**:
   - Add Web3 page with campaign donation links
   - Add campaign banner to homepage
   - Ensure all event dates are correct

2. **Near-term (Post-Campaign)**:
   - Integrate web3 mentions across program pages
   - Update Strategic Plan language if finalized
   - Improve navigation consistency

3. **Medium-term**:
   - Add testimonials and impact stories
   - Create Resources section
   - Enhance mobile experience

The website is generally well-maintained and clear, but adding content about your web3 initiatives will significantly improve how you communicate your full range of work to your community.
