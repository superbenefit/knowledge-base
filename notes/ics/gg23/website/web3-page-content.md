## Web3 & Regenerative Finance at ICS

The Institute for Community Sustainability is exploring how web3 technologies and regenerative finance can enhance our community sustainability initiatives and secure their long-term resilience.

### Bridging Local Sustainability with Global Regenerative Networks

For years, we've been building tangible sustainability programs in London through our Repair Café and Thing Library. These initiatives have created measurable impact:

- **1,000+ kg** diverted from landfill through our Repair Café in 2024 alone
- **$14,000+** saved by community members through our Thing Library
- **500+** community members engaged in sustainability initiatives

Now, we're bridging these local efforts with global regenerative networks by integrating web3 tools and approaches.

### Our Web3 Initiatives

#### Green Pill London
We're establishing a [Green Pill Network](https://greenpill.network/) chapter in London, Ontario – creating a local node in the global regenerative ecosystem. This chapter will connect our community with cutting-edge regenerative finance tools, education, and resources.

#### Reimagining Power Project
As a key partner in the [Reimagining Power Project](https://pub.superbenefit.org/reimagining-power-how-web3-can-transform-social-impact), we're exploring how blockchain technology can enable community ownership, transparent governance, and equitable resource distribution for social impact initiatives.

#### On-Chain Impact Verification
We're working to document the environmental and social impact of our programs through web3 tools like impact attestations. This creates transparent, verifiable records of sustainability outcomes that can attract future funding and support.

#### Decentralized Governance Exploration
We're testing new approaches to community governance using web3 tools, with the goal of making our programs more participatory, transparent, and resilient.

### Support Our Web3 Journey

**We're currently participating in Gitcoin Grants Round 23,** a special funding opportunity that uses "quadratic funding" to make small donations incredibly powerful.

Even a small donation of $2-20 significantly increases our matching funds! The number of supporters matters more than the amount.

**Support options:**
- [Donate via Gitcoin](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/31/52) (Web3 option)
- Donate via PayPal/Credit Card (Traditional option)
