# We Need Your Help! ðŸ’š

Dear friend of the Institute for Community Sustainability,

**We're reaching out today with a special request that will take just 2 minutes of your time but could significantly impact our long-term sustainability.**

The Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) is participating in Gitcoin Grants Round 23, a special funding opportunity that uses a unique model called "quadratic funding." This approach prioritizes the *number* of contributors over the amount each person gives â€” making even small donations of $2-20 incredibly powerful!

## Why This Matters for Our Future

This funding round represents a key piece of our long-term sustainability strategy. Beyond the immediate financial support, it helps us:

- Establish relationships with funders in the regenerative finance space
- Access matched funding that multiplies each donation
- Build our capacity to support community-driven programs like the Repair CafÃ© and Thing Library

## What We're Building

While you might know us for our Repair CafÃ© and Thing Library, we've also been exploring how new technologies can help scale community sustainability initiatives. We're building bridges between our local work and global networks, documenting everything we learn so other communities can benefit.

If you're curious about this aspect of our work, we wrote an article about [how web3 can transform social impact](https://pub.superbenefit.org/reimagining-power-how-web3-can-transform-social-impact).

We're also excited to share that we're launching a new Green Pill London chapter, connecting our city with a global network focused on regenerative economics. (More info coming soon!)

## How You Can Help â€” It's Easy!

**We need your support by April 16th.** Even a small donation of just $2-20 will make a significant difference thanks to the matching calculations.

You can contribute through:
- **Credit Card or PayPal:** [YOUR PAYPAL LINK] (No crypto knowledge needed!)
- **Web3 options:** [https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/31/52](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/31/52)

## Your Support Means The World To Us

After years of building community sustainability programs, often with limited resources and many volunteer hours, your support would mean the world to us. This is truly a case where many small contributions create something much greater than the sum of their parts.

**[DONATE $2-20 NOW]**

With deep gratitude,

Heenal Rajani & the ICS Team

## Social Impact Through Gitcoin Grants

*This section can be included at the bottom of the newsletter for those wanting more information*

**What is Gitcoin Grants?**
Gitcoin Grants uses "quadratic funding" to democratize the funding of public goods. This mathematical approach gives more weight to the number of contributors than the amount each person gives.

**Why small donations matter:**
- A project with 50 donors giving $5 each ($250 total) can receive MORE in matching funds than a project with 5 donors giving $100 each ($500 total)
- This approach prioritizes community support over a few large donors
- Your small contribution significantly amplifies our chances of receiving substantial matching funds

**Our Impact So Far:**
- Repair CafÃ©: 1,000+ kg diverted from landfill in 2024
- Thing Library: $14,000+ saved through community sharing
- 500+ community members engaged in sustainability initiatives
