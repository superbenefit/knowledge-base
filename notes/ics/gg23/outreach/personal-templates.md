Hey [Name],

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out about something important to me - the Institute for Community Sustainability is participating in Gitcoin Grants Round 23.

This is actually my first time running a campaign like this, and I'd really appreciate your support. Our application highlights the work we're doing to bridge local sustainability initiatives (like our Repair Café and Thing Library) with web3 regenerative tools.

The cool thing about Gitcoin is that even small donations (literally $1-5) help significantly because of their quadratic funding model, which prioritizes the number of contributors over the amount.

Would you consider making a small contribution before [DATE]? Here's the link:

Thanks for considering! Let me know if you have any questions.

With gratitude,
Heenal

## Web3/ReFi Contacts Template
*For people in the regenerative finance/web3 space*

```
Hey [Name],

Hope all is well with you! I'm reaching out because the Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) is in the current Gitcoin Grants round under the Regen Coordination bucket.

We're doing some meaningful work bridging grassroots sustainability initiatives with regenerative web3 tools - including on-chain impact verification for our Repair Café (which has diverted 1,000+ kg from landfill this year alone), and experimenting with community-owned infrastructure through the London Thing Library.

As we document these patterns, we're creating open-source playbooks and sharing them through the SuperBenefit knowledge garden.

Would you consider supporting our application? Even $1-5 helps significantly with the matching calculation:

Appreciate your consideration - and your work in this space!

Warmly,
Heenal

Hi [Name],

I hope this message finds you well! I'm reaching out because the Institute for Community Sustainability has an opportunity for some additional funding through a platform called Gitcoin Grants.

You might remember our [Repair Café/Thing Library/other program] that you've participated in. This funding would help us continue and expand these local initiatives while also documenting our approach so other communities can learn from our work.

The interesting thing about this funding model is that the number of supporters matters more than the amount - even small donations ($1-5) significantly increase our matching funds!

If you'd like to support our work, you can contribute here before [DATE]:
https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/31/52

Thank you for being part of our community and considering this request. Let me know if you have any questions about the process!

With appreciation,
Heenal

## Follow-Up Template
*For people who expressed interest but haven't yet donated*

```
Hey [Name],

Just a friendly follow-up about the Gitcoin Grants application I mentioned for the Institute for Community Sustainability. The round closes tomorrow, and we're currently at [X] unique donors toward our goal of 50.

Every single contribution, regardless of size, significantly improves our matching funds. If you're still interested in supporting, even a $1 donation would make a meaningful difference at this point!

Here's the link again: https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/31/52

Thanks again for considering, and no pressure either way.

Best,
Heenal

## Thank You Template
*For people who have donated*

```
Hi [Name],

I just wanted to send a quick note of gratitude for your contribution to our Gitcoin Grants application! Your support means a lot to me personally and to the work we're doing at the Institute for Community Sustainability.

These funds will directly support our efforts to bridge local sustainability work with regenerative finance tools, and to share what we learn with the broader ecosystem.

If you know others who might be interested in supporting before the round closes on [DATE], we'd appreciate you sharing the link: https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/31/52

Thank you again for being part of this journey!

With deep appreciation,
Heenal
