## Request to Team Members Template

Hello ICS team!

As you know, we're participating in Gitcoin Grants Round 23 which runs until April 16th. We have a great opportunity to secure matching funds based on the number of unique donors we attract.

I'd like to ask each of you to help by:

1. Making a small donation yourself if possible (even $1 helps significantly with the matching!)
2. Reaching out to 3-5 personal contacts who might support our work
3. Sharing our campaign on your social media

Here's everything you need:

DONATION LINK: https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/31/52

WHAT WE'RE FUNDING: This campaign supports our work bridging local sustainability initiatives (Repair Caf√©, Thing Library) with web3 regenerative tools. We're documenting patterns for replication and contribution to the knowledge commons.

SUGGESTED MESSAGE TO CONTACTS:
"Hi [Name], I'm helping with the Institute for Community Sustainability's Gitcoin Grants application. We're building bridges between local sustainability work and regenerative finance. Even a $1 donation helps significantly with matching funds! If you'd like to support: https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/31/52"

Thank you for your help! Please let me know if you have any questions.

## Tracking Sheet for Team Mobilization

Consider creating a simple spreadsheet or table where team members can track their outreach:

| Team Member | Personal Donation | # Contacts Reached | # Donations Secured | Social Media Shared |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| [Name 1]    | Yes/No            | [number]           | [number]           | Yes/No              |
| [Name 2]    | Yes/No            | [number]           | [number]           | Yes/No              |
| [Name 3]    | Yes/No            | [number]           | [number]           | Yes/No              |

## Tips for Effective Team Mobilization

### 1. Make it Simple
- Provide everything they need in one place
- Create templates they can copy and paste
- Set clear, achievable expectations (e.g., "reach out to 3-5 people")

### 2. Create Accountability
- Set up a tracking system (like the table above)
- Schedule a quick check-in halfway through the campaign
- Celebrate and acknowledge contributions

### 3. Provide Support
- Offer to answer any questions about web3/Gitcoin for their contacts
- Be available to troubleshoot any issues
- Send reminders without being pushy

### 4. Show Gratitude
- Thank team members individually for their help
- Acknowledge their contributions in team meetings
- Share the final results and impact of their efforts
