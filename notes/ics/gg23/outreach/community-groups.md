### Initial Announcement (Day 1)
```
Hello [Community Name] friends! 

I wanted to share that the Institute for Community Sustainability is participating in @GitcoinGrants Round 23 under the Regen Coordination bucket.

We're building bridges between local sustainability work (our Repair Caf√©, Thing Library) and web3 regenerative coordination - documenting patterns for the commons through the SuperBenefit knowledge garden.

Even a $1 donation significantly helps with matching! If you'd like to support our work:
