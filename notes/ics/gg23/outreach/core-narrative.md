# Core Narrative for GG23 Campaign

This document provides a focused story and talking points about why this campaign matters. Use this to craft personal messages, social media posts, and community updates.

## The Core Story

The Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) bridges two worlds that rarely meet: grassroots local sustainability work and regenerative web3 coordination.

In our Repair Café, volunteer fixers help community members repair broken items instead of throwing them away. Our Thing Library lets people borrow tools instead of buying them. These programs create tangible impact - we've diverted over 1,000 kg from landfill this year alone and saved community members more than $14,000 through shared resources.

But we're doing something even more significant: we're documenting patterns of community sustainability and exploring how web3 tools can amplify this impact. We're experimenting with on-chain impact attestations, decentralized governance for local initiatives, and community-owned infrastructure.

By participating in Gitcoin Grants Round 23, we're not just seeking funding for our local work - we're contributing to a global knowledge commons that can help other communities implement similar programs while maintaining sovereignty over their resources and data.

Your contribution - even just $1 - helps us continue building these bridges and sharing what we learn with the broader ecosystem.

## Key Talking Points

### 1. Tangible Local Impact
- Our Repair Café has diverted 1,011 kg from landfill in 2024 alone
- The Thing Library has saved community members $14,417 and prevented 10,675 kg of embodied carbon
- These programs create real-world sustainability impact while building community resilience

### 2. Building Bridges to Web3

- We've successfully on-ramped $140,000 CAD to fund web3 experimentation
- We're prototyping decentralized governance mechanisms for local sustainability initiatives

### 3. Contributing to the Commons
- We document patterns and playbooks through the SuperBenefit knowledge garden
- We contribute to the Reimagining Power Project, exploring how web3 can redistribute power
- We're creating open-source templates for other communities to adapt and implement

### 4. Why GG23 Matters
- Quadratic funding prioritizes community support over whale donors
- Even small donations significantly improve our matching calculation
- This funding supports both our local work and our global knowledge sharing

### 5. Personal Element (Customize This)
- This is our first Gitcoin Grants campaign
- We're learning to navigate the intersection of traditional non-profits and web3
- Your support means a great deal both practically and as encouragement

## Adapting the Narrative for Different Audiences

### For Web3-Native Audiences
Emphasize our experimentation with on-chain governance, impact attestations, and contributions to the wider ecosystem. Highlight our role as a bridge between traditional sustainability work and regenerative coordination.

### For Sustainability-Focused Audiences
Focus on the tangible impact of our Repair Café and Thing Library, then introduce how web3 tools can enhance and scale this work. Explain quadratic funding in simple terms as a way to prioritize community support.

### For Local Community Members
Emphasize the direct benefits to London, Ontario - waste diverted, money saved, skills shared. Frame web3 as a tool for enhancing local resilience and connecting our community to global movements.

### For Potential Partners/Funders
Highlight our unique position bridging traditional non-profits, grassroots initiatives, and web3 innovation. Emphasize our documentation of patterns and commitment to open-source knowledge sharing.
