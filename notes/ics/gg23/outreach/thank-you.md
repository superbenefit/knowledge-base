Dear [Name],

I wanted to personally thank you for your contribution to the Institute for Community Sustainability's Gitcoin Grants Round 23 campaign.

Your support helped us reach [X] unique donors and raise $[X] in total funding! This will directly enable our work bridging local sustainability initiatives with regenerative web3 tools, specifically:

- Continuing to document patterns from our Repair CafÃ© and Thing Library for the knowledge commons
- Experimenting with on-chain impact attestations for community sustainability work
- Prototyping a local node in the global regenerative ecosystem

I'm especially grateful for your support as this was my first Gitcoin Grants campaign. Your belief in our work means a lot to me personally and to our entire team.

If you'd like to stay updated on our progress or get involved further, please let me know. I'd be happy to share more about our upcoming initiatives.

With deep appreciation,
Heenal

## Tips for Meaningful Thank Yous

1. **Be specific about the impact** - Let donors know exactly what their support will enable
2. **Acknowledge personal connections** - Reference your relationship when appropriate
3. **Share results** - Include the total donor count and funding amount
4. **Express authentic gratitude** - Let your genuine appreciation come through
5. **Invite continued engagement** - Offer ways to stay connected to the work
6. **Send promptly** - Aim to send thank yous within 48 hours of the campaign closing

## Additional Touch Points

Consider these additional ways to express gratitude beyond the initial thank you:

1. **Impact updates** - Share progress on funded initiatives after 1-3 months
