## Key Links to Include

Always include these links in your outreach:

1. **Gitcoin Donation Link**: https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/31/52
2. **PayPal Alternative**: [YOUR PAYPAL LINK] (for non-web3 audiences)
3. **Quadratic Funding Explanation**: wtfisqf.com (for non-web3 audiences)

## Core Messaging Elements

Use these points consistently across all communications:

1. **Local-to-Global Bridge**: We connect tangible local sustainability work with global regenerative networks
2. **Impact Metrics**: 1,000+ kg diverted, $14,000+ saved, 500+ community members engaged
3. **Knowledge Commons**: We document patterns so other communities can replicate our work
4. **Quadratic Funding Power**: Even $1 significantly helps through the matching calculation

## Communication Do's and Don'ts

### Do's:
- Personalize messages whenever possible
- Highlight tangible impact with specific metrics
- Offer both web3 and traditional payment options
- Explain quadratic funding simply (using wtfisqf.com)
- Express authentic enthusiasm for the work

### Don'ts:
- Use technical jargon with non-web3 audiences
- Overwhelm yourself by trying to do everything
- Forget to track your outreach and results
- Miss the opportunity to thank donors promptly

## Self-Care Reminders

- This is your first Gitcoin round - celebrate that milestone regardless of outcome
- Prioritize highest-impact activities if energy is limited
- Remember that every donor counts as a win, even if you don't hit 50
- Your work has value beyond what any funding round can measure

Good luck with your campaign! Remember that this is just one funding round among many possibilities, and the relationships you build during this process will continue to benefit your work long after GG23 concludes.
