## 💌 **ICS Channels**

### Newsletter 

- Write a feature section about GG23 with:
  - Why it matters
  - What ICS is piloting
  - How people can help (link, donor goal, share call)

### Social Media

Use Instagram, Facebook, and X to:

- Post a simple CTA with image of Repair Café, Tool Library, or QF explainer
- Share progress (e.g. "25 donors down, 25 to go!")
- Tag supporters and partners

### **Physical Outreach**

- **Repair Café attendees** – QR code posters + live ask at events
- **Flyer in Tool Library**
- **Posters in coworking / community spaces** (e.g. Innovation Works, libraries, food co-op)

### **1:1 Outreach**

- Personalized messages to friends, family, aligned orgs — especially those who've benefited from ICS or care about ReFi/local sustainability
- Emphasize the **matching donor pool** incentive

---

## 💡 **Extra Ideas**

### **Incentives & Engagement**

- POAP for donors (is that allowed?)
- Leaderboard or donor recognition on ICS site or socials
- "Why I donated" campaign – quick video clips or quotes
- Donor milestone celebrations (e.g. "We just hit 25 donors!")

### **Partnerships**

- Ask aligned orgs to **retweet/share** (e.g. ReFi DAO, OpenCivics, GreenPill)
- Offer to **cross-promote** other GG23 participants who share ICS values
