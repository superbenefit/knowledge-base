# Simple Graphics for GG23 Campaign

This document outlines simple graphics you can create or adapt for the campaign. Focus on creating 1-2 high-impact visuals rather than many different ones.

## Recommended Graphics

### 1. Primary Campaign Graphic
Create a simple image that includes:
- ICS logo
- Text: "Support our Gitcoin Grants Round 23 Project"
- Text: "Help us bridge local sustainability with regenerative finance"
- Simple visual element representing connection (e.g., bridge icon, connecting lines)
- QR code linking to donation page

### 2. Impact Metrics Graphic
Create a simple infographic showing:
- Key metrics from the Repair Café and Thing Library
- Simple icons representing waste diverted, items repaired, community members engaged
- Brief text explaining how web3 tools enhance this impact
- QR code linking to donation page

## Creation Options

### Option 1: Simple Design Tools
If you have limited time, use one of these simple tools:
- **Canva** - Free templates available, drag-and-drop interface
- **Figma** - More flexible but slightly steeper learning curve
- **Slide software** (PowerPoint, Google Slides) - Quick and familiar

### Option 2: Use Existing Photos
If design tools feel overwhelming:
1. Select a compelling photo from a Repair Café event
2. Add simple text overlay with key message
3. Add donation link or QR code

### Option 3: AI-Generated Graphics
If you have access to an AI image generator:
1. Create a prompt describing a simple visual representing "bridging local sustainability with web3"
2. Add text and QR code to the generated image

## Quick Tips for Non-Designers
1. Use no more than 2 fonts
2. Ensure text is readable (high contrast with background)
3. Include ample white space
4. Use simple icons rather than complex illustrations
5. Keep text minimal - focus on the key message
6. Make sure any QR codes are large enough to scan easily

## Sample Prompts for AI Image Generation
If using DALL-E, Midjourney or similar tools:

```
A simple, clean illustration showing a bridge connecting a community repair café on one side with digital blockchain technology on the other. Flat design style with muted green and blue colors. Minimalist style.
```

```
A split-screen graphic showing real-world sustainability (repair café, tool library) on one side and digital regenerative finance symbols on the other, connected by a glowing path. Professional infographic style.
```

## Where to Use These Graphics
- Social media posts
- Telegram/Discord announcements
- Email newsletter
- As profile pictures during the campaign

Remember: One clear, professional-looking graphic used consistently is better than multiple lower-quality images.
