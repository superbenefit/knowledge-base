# GG23 Tweet Analysis & Inspiration

Based on observations of successful GG23 campaign tweets, here are the common patterns, styles, and approaches that tend to perform well:

## Common Tweet Patterns

### Announcement Tweets
- Short, direct announcements about GG23 participation
- Often include project logo or team photo
- Almost always include the direct donation link
- Commonly use emojis (especially üå± üåç üíö ‚ú®)
- Often include a call to action like "Support us!" or "Every donation counts!"

### Educational Tweets
- Explain quadratic funding simply ("Your $1 has more impact than you think!")
- Link to wtfisqf.com for non-web3 audiences
- Often include simple graphics showing how QF works
- Focus on "number of contributors matters more than amounts"

### Impact Tweets
- Share concrete metrics and achievements
- Often include before/after comparisons
- Frequently mention specific communities benefiting
- Use visuals showing the project in action

### Progress Updates
- Thank donors so far
- Share current number of contributors
- Create urgency ("Only X days left!")
- Often use progress bars or visualizations

### Personal Stories
- First-person narratives about why the project matters
- Often more emotionally resonant
- Include personal journey and challenges
- Less formal, more conversational tone

### Community Shoutouts
- Tag and thank other projects in the round
- Encourage cross-support between aligned projects
- Create sense of camaraderie rather than competition
- Often end with "Let's fund public goods together!"

## Effective Stylistic Elements

### Length & Structure
- Main announcement tweets tend to be concise (1-3 sentences)
- Thread starters are typically longer with hooks at the end
- Most use line breaks between sentences for readability
- Many use bullet points to highlight key benefits

### Tone & Voice
- Authentic and passionate rather than corporate
- Often conversational and direct ("We've been building X...")
- Balance of factual (what we do) and emotional (why it matters)
- Frequently uses collective language ("we", "us", "together")

### Visual Elements
- Project logos and team photos perform well
- Simple infographics explaining impact
- Screenshots of the project in action
- Progress trackers during the round

### Hashtag Usage
- #GG23 is universal
- #PublicGoods and #ReFi are common
- Project-specific hashtags help with tracking
- Some use location-specific tags for regional projects
