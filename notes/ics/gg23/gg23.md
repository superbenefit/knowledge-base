# GG23 Campaign Strategy & Execution Plan

## Campaign Summary
The Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) is participating in Gitcoin Grants Round 23 (GG23) under the Regen Coordination category. With three days remaining in the round, this document outlines a focused strategy to maximize our impact with limited time and capacity.

## Goals
- **Primary**: Secure 50+ unique donations
- **Secondary**: Raise $1,000+ in total funding
- **Tertiary**: Rank in the top 25% of projects by donation metrics

## Strategic Approach
Our strategy focuses on quality over quantity, leveraging existing relationships and communities rather than attempting broad outreach to new audiences.

### Core Messaging Themes
1. **Local-to-Global Impact**: ICS bridges grassroots sustainability work with global ReFi infrastructure
2. **Tangible Results**: Highlight real-world impact through Repair Caf√© and Thing Library metrics
3. **Knowledge Commons Contribution**: Emphasize how ICS is documenting patterns for the wider ecosystem

### Campaign Assets
All assets are stored in subdirectories:
- `/tweets` - Social media content
- `/outreach` - Direct message templates
- `/graphics` - Visual assets

## Notes on Capacity & Self-Care
This plan acknowledges limited capacity and the challenge of putting yourself out there. Focus on what feels most meaningful and sustainable:

- If energy is limited, prioritize personal outreach over general posts
- It's better to connect deeply with a few supporters than superficially with many
- Remember that each donation, regardless of size, helps with matching calculations
- Be authentic about the work - your passion for ICS's mission is your strongest asset
