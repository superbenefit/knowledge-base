# Institute for Cosmolocalism (ICS) - Working Materials

This directory contains draft materials and work-in-progress documents related to SuperBenefit's collaboration with the Institute for Cosmolocalism. Unlike the polished content in `/artifacts/`, this directory contains exploratory ideas, research notes, and draft frameworks that are still being developed.

## Purpose

The materials in this directory serve several purposes:

1. **Documentation of ongoing research** into cosmolocal approaches to organization, production, and governance
2. **Development of frameworks** for implementing cosmolocal principles in different contexts
3. **Exploration of case studies** showcasing successful cosmolocal implementations
4. **Collaborative development** of resources with ICS partners

## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to this work, please:

1. **Review existing materials** to understand current thinking and avoid duplication
2. **Follow the templates** in `/tools/templates/` for consistency
3. **Share drafts early** for feedback from the community
4. **Connect your work** to relevant resources in the knowledge base

## Moving to Artifacts
