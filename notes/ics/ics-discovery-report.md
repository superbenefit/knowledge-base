# System Mapping

## Current State

ICS' initiatives aim to promote environmental stewardship, community resilience, and the fostering of meaningful interconnections among Londoners. ICS evolved from Reimagine Co, a package-free grocery store and community hub, to become a distinct organization with a broader mission: helping Londoners lead more sustainable and connected lives. Through programs that focus on reducing waste, sharing resources, and educating the community, ICS has consistently championed the principles of sustainability and community empowerment. ICS operates several flagship programs:

**Repair Café:** This initiative mobilizes a network of skilled volunteers who repair household items free of charge, keeping valuable resources out of landfills. These events are more than just environmental efforts; they foster a sense of community by connecting participants with shared values and interests. The Repair Cafés model also highlights the importance of empowering individuals with practical repair skills, reducing dependency on consumption-driven solutions.  \*\* _include repair cafe stats_ \*\*

**Thing Library:** The Thing Library allows community members to borrow tools and equipment that they might otherwise have to purchase. This service significantly reduces material consumption and promotes resource sharing. By lowering the financial barriers to accessing tools, the Thing Library ensures that sustainable practices are not limited to those with disposable income. It also strengthens community ties by encouraging members to share resources and expertise. \*\* _include TL stats_ \*\*

**Community Workshops:** ICS regularly organizes workshops that cover a diverse range of topics, including furniture repair, clothing mending, and sustainable cooking. These workshops equip participants with practical skills while fostering a culture of self-reliance. Moreover, these sessions serve as platforms for community members to connect and collaborate, amplifying ICS's mission to build interdependent communities.  \*\* _include total # of workshops and participants (in total and/or last year)_ \*\*

\*\* _connections with funders, community partners_ \*\* get some info from past grant applications etc

The governance structure of ICS is currently centralized, with high-level decisions made by a core team, supported by volunteers. **While effective for program delivery, this model places significant pressure on the core team and limits volunteer agency** **and community ownership****.**

# Creating a local node of the global regenerative movement

ICS' exploration: How can we scale regenerative solutions, empower communities, and catalyze a global transition to an economy where cooperation and mutualism replace extraction and exploitation?

_"I am incredibly excited to co-create an ecosystem that harmonizes humans, nature, and technology. I am inspired by the incredible people and organizations working towards these solutions. Together, we can fortify the ReFi movement, plant seeds of regeneration across our web of local nodes and online communities, and forge a regenerative future." — Monty Merlin_

## Coordi-Nations

At the heart of Regen Coordination lies the concept of Coordi-nations or 'Network Nations', an innovative approach to global cooperation. Coordi-nations focus on interwoven networks of communities that operate on mutualism, collaboration, and distributed decision-making. These communities come together through shared values and participatory governance to pool resources for greater impact.

_"We're building a coordinated network of thousands of hackers, dreamers, and doers focused on using crypto to bring positive digital systems to the world._

_We're trying to highlight the people who are doing this and help them find each other. It's been fun to create a space for people to come together and explore this world collectively. There's just something more exciting about working together in a multiplayer way. The energy from having smart people from diverse backgrounds working earnestly on this idea really feeds off of each other." - Kevin Owocki_

ICS strives to co-create this kind of dynamic, a space where the energy of collaboration fuels impactful change, turning individual efforts into something far greater through the power of community.

## Cosmo-localism

Cosmo-localism is an emerging framework to help conceptualise and organise in ways that encourage global solidarity and identity while maintaining deep and meaningful local connections and ties. Cosmolocalism is centered around protecting and enhancing the commons, a paradigm shift from the extractive logic of capitalist markets. It is a framework that captures ancient wisdom and practises in a 21st century digital context: in a cosmo-local view institutions are neither market- nor state-centric, but commons-centric.

Cosmo-localism bridges global knowledge with local action by empowering communities to access global tools and resources while adapting them to their local contexts. This concept eliminates hierarchical global-to-local dynamics, promoting decentralized, participatory models that allow communities to tailor solutions to their specific cultural and environmental needs.

## Becoming a Local Node

The ICS intends to become part of a decentralized network of community hubs that foster ecological, social, and economic regeneration through localized initiatives. These nodes do not exist in isolation; they are part of a larger ecosystem that includes the Green Pill Network, Regens Unite, Celo, and  ReFi DAO. Each of these groups contributes a unique proposition to the broader regenerative movement (source):

- **ReFi Local Nodes:** Focused on grassroots, localized initiatives, nodes address specific community needs such as environmental restoration, community governance, and regenerative finance education.

- **Green Pill Network Chapters:** These chapters bring a tech-centric, crypto-native perspective to the table, fostering innovation in public goods funding and leveraging tools like quadratic funding to maximize impact.

- **Regens Unite:** Rooted in permaculture, conscious community building, and grassroots activism, this network highlights the importance of local action combined with philosophical and design-driven approaches to regeneration.

ICS embodies and integrates elements from all these frameworks. It leverages its existing infrastructure as an established federal not-for-profit organization with strong civil society connections and a history of impactful programming to address local needs while connecting to global regenerative movements. This dual role allows ICS to serve both as a localized action hub and as a bridge to larger networks of regenerative practice.

## Activities of a local node

Local nodes serve as hubs for hosting regenerative local events designed to engage and onboard diverse leaders, organizations, and individuals into the work of ecological, social, and economic renewal. The emphasis is on radical inclusivity, creating spaces where diverse voices can converge, share insights, and collaborate on actionable solutions. Events might feature leaders sharing their unique contributions, creating a dynamic environment where local action is inspired and supported.

In addition to events, local nodes often engage in creating and disseminating regenerative media, including blogs, articles, podcasts, and whitepapers. These efforts help amplify the vision and practices of the node to a broader audience while documenting progress and innovations. Mapping the local regenerative society is another critical activity, identifying stakeholders, resources, and opportunities within the community. This foundational work lays the groundwork for larger initiatives, such as acquiring land, developing land-based regenerative projects, and building open-source tools that others can adapt and use.

Through these activities, local nodes can become catalysts for broader systemic change. They can attract value-aligned capital, enable the exchange of knowledge and resources, and foster a culture of mutualism and resilience. 

## Insights from MycoFi

The MycoFi framework offers biomimetic insights that can inform ICS's evolution as a ReFi local node. By drawing on the patterns of mycelial networks, ICS can:

- **Create Dynamic Flows of Resources:** Once established as a local node, ICS can model its operations on the mycelial concept of moving resources to where they are needed most. This could involve coordinating local regenerative projects, ensuring that funding and support are directed dynamically based on emerging community needs.

- **Adopt Fractal Governance:** As a local node, ICS can implement a governance system inspired by mycelial fractals, enabling decision-making structures that are both scalable and adaptable. Each program or initiative could function as an independent cell, while maintaining alignment with overarching organizational goals.

- **Foster Economic Resilience:** By leveraging MycoFi's principles of interconnected networks, ICS can strengthen its local economy through initiatives like decentralized mutual aid systems or community currencies. This approach could enhance resilience against external economic shocks and build a robust foundation for regeneration.

These MycoFi-inspired ideas provide a roadmap for ICS to amplify its impact as a ReFi local node, fostering regenerative ecosystems and aligning with broader web3 innovations. This alignment positions ICS as a leader in applying ecological wisdom to community sustainability and web3 innovation.

## Becoming a bioregional hub

One thing that sets ICS apart is its potential to transcend the limitations of a single local node. By embracing the concept of "economies of scope," ICS can evolve into a **bioregional hub**. 

A bioregional hub goes beyond the traditional boundaries of a node by coordinating multiple stakeholders, mutualizing resources, and enabling systemic, place-based solutions. It facilitates deeper collaboration across sectors - from public to private to civil society - while fostering innovation and capacity building. This approach aligns with the principles of coordi-nations, voluntary interwoven networks that emphasize mutualism, participatory governance, and sovereignty.

Through its participation in these intersecting networks, ICS can not only fulfill its mission locally but also amplify impact globally, contributing to the collective efforts of the broader regenerative movement.

# Possibilities for Experimentation

## Governance for Sustainability

ICS aims to prototype a decentralized governance model inspired by DAO principles. This governance model would:

- Establish autonomous cells for each program (e.g., Repair Café Cell, Thing Library Cell) that have the freedom to make decisions within their operational domains. These cells would act as independent units with clear accountability structures, enabling agile responses to program-specific challenges and opportunities.

- Facilitate cross-cell coordination through shared platforms and regular meetings to ensure resources, expertise, and information flow effectively across the organization. This interconnected structure would prevent silos and foster collective problem-solving.

- Incorporate a stakeholder house comprising community members, volunteers, and partners. This body would serve as a check-and-balance mechanism, safeguarding ICS's mission and ensuring alignment with broader community needs.

## Impact Attestations as Proof Of Impact

Hypercerts are one example of a blockchain-enabled approach to documenting and communicating the impact of ICS initiatives. Specifically, ICS could:

- Use hypercerts to quantify its environmental and social contributions, such as the volume of waste diverted through the Repair Café or the community reach of its workshops. These metrics would provide tangible evidence of ICS's impact, enhancing credibility and trust.

- Store these hypercerts on-chain, creating a permanent and transparent record accessible to donors, partners, and the public. This would also enable real-time tracking of ICS's achievements, fostering continuous improvement.

- Leverage these certificates to participate in funding rounds hosted by platforms like Gitcoin and Giveth, thereby unlocking new streams of financial support. The transparency provided by hypercerts could attract mission-aligned donors and investors.

## Community Onboarding to Web3

Engaging the London community in web3 could include the following aspects:

- Host accessible and interactive in-person events, where participants can learn about blockchain and ReFi in a welcoming environment. These events would serve as entry points for community members unfamiliar with web3 technologies.

- Provide hands-on experiences with web3 tools, such as creating wallets and minting NFTs, to demystify the technology and build confidence among attendees. Practical demonstrations and user-friendly interfaces would be critical to fostering adoption.

- Develop clear, jargon-free educational materials tailored to non-technical audiences, emphasizing the practical benefits of web3 technologies for everyday life. These materials could include infographics, videos, and step-by-step guides.

## On and Off-Ramping Role of ICS

As part of its role as a partner and stakeholder in the Reimagining Power Project, the ICS has acted as a fiscal sponsor to the project, on-ramping fiat (Canadian Dollars) and purchasing ETH to fund project activities. 

To futher develop its emerging role in bridging the web3 and meatspace regenerative ecosystems, ICS could:

- Pilot a process for off-ramping cryptocurrency donations into fiat currency to fund local initiatives. This experiment will test the feasibility and scalability of using ICS as an intermediary for other organizations interested in web3.

- Document the process thoroughly in the form of a pattern that can be included in a playbook, ensuring transparency and ease of adoption by others. 

## Piloting a Quadratic Funding Experiment

Quadratic funding (QF) offers a unique opportunity to explore decentralized, participatory funding mechanisms that align with web3 principles. As a local node, ICS could pilot a real-life quadratic funding experiment to assess its feasibility, user experience, and potential for broader application in the community. The goal of this experiment would be to demonstrate how QF can be implemented effectively in a local context while building awareness and adoption of web3 tools.

One potential application of this experiment could focus on supporting local artists. ICS could organize a live event where multiple artists present their work and interact with attendees. Participants would tip their favourite artists, and these contributions would be matched quadratically to maximize their impact. This approach would showcase the participatory nature of quadratic funding in a fun way, while highlighting its ability to amplify community support.

To ensure accessibility, ICS could integrate hybrid solutions, blending on-chain and off-chain technologies to accommodate participants unfamiliar with web3. Partnerships with local arts organizations would amplify the event's reach and ensure alignment with community priorities. This artist-focused application would provide valuable insights into the broader potential of quadratic funding as a tool for fostering community-driven regeneration.

Quadratic funding represents an exciting opportunity to support local artists while showcasing web3's potential. ICS could:

- **Explore the potential of organizing a live event where multiple artists present their work and interact with attendees. Visitors can tip their favourite artists, and these tips would be matched quadratically to maximize impact, highlighting the participatory and inclusive nature of web3-enabled funding**.

- Develop specifcations for - followed by an MVP of - an app experience to facilitate the above in a low-friction way, ensuring the event is inclusive by providing a user-friendly interface for participants unfamiliar with web3, eg by using abstracted wallets to reduce friction.

## Establish a Green Pill Network Local Chapter

ICS could collaborate with partners such as Corduroy Earth and with other local regenerative initiatives to establish a Green Pill Network (GPN) local chapter in London, Ontario. This chapter would serve as a hub for facilitating connections and fostering collaboration with the wider Green Pill Network, while also advancing local goals for ecological, social, and economic regeneration. By aligning with the GPN, ICS could leverage global expertise and resources while tailoring solutions to the unique needs of the London community.

As part of this initiative, ICS could:

- **Amplify Awareness:** Utilize the GPN platform to showcase London-based regenerative projects and share lessons learned with the global network.

- **Advance Local Goals:** Use the GPN chapter as a springboard to pilot innovative approaches, such as quadratic funding experiments or web3 onboarding initiatives, in collaboration with other local stakeholders.

## Become a member of the Breadchain Cooperative

ICS already embodies the principles of the Breadchain Cooperative, such as mutual aid, transparent governance, and the promotion of economic democracy. Joining Breadchain would enable ICS to collaborate with values-aligned organizations and cooperatives globally, enhancing its ability to contribute to a post-capitalist future. While ICS does not yet meet Breadchain's financial and democracy requirements, it is actively moving in that direction, leveraging web3 tools and decentralized models to strengthen its governance and community impact.

As a Breadchain member, ICS could:

- **Foster Community Onboarding:** Host educational events and workshops to engage local participants with Breadchain's mission and introduce them to solidarity primitives like $BREAD.

- **Develop Democratic Governance Practices:** Prototype participatory decision-making models that align with Breadchain's principles of transparent and accountable governance, paving the way for full membership.

- **Pilot a Local Mutual Credit System:** Establish a community-based mutual credit system that allows members to exchange goods and services without the need for traditional currency. This system could support local resilience and align with Breadchain's principles of mutual aid and economic democracy.
