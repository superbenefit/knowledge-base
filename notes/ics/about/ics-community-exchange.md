# Community Exchange: Connecting Curiosity and Commitment in London

_A working model for ICS, Reimagine Co, and the wider community – March 2025_

## 1. Introduction & Context

Over the past few years, we've experimented with a Human Library-inspired format in London: community events where people show up not just to consume content, but to offer and receive wisdom, stories, skills, and curiosities. These gatherings have never relied on the "book" and "reader" metaphor—instead, they invited people to ask and answer two simple questions:

"What do you want to learn or explore?"
"What do you want to teach or share?"

People shared about composting, growing food, healing from trauma, raising children, 3D printing, making art, and dozens of other passions and lived experiences. These encounters were often casual and emergent. Sometimes they sparked new friendships or inspired someone to offer a workshop or follow up over coffee.

At the same time, we've been exploring how to make mutual aid more tangible, trackable, and fair. Inspired by the work of Grassroots Economics and its model of "commitment pooling," we began to imagine what it would look like to build a participatory economy right here in London—where people could pledge help, skills, meals, or money, and receive value in return without relying entirely on cash.

Community Exchange is our name (for now) for this integration of Connection Circles (relationship-based discovery) and a Commitment Pool (credit-based mutual aid). It's an experiment in combining trust and trackability, curiosity and contribution.

## 2. The Community Exchange Model

Community Exchange is structured around two interconnected spaces:

1. **Connection Circles**
   - Gatherings where people explore what they can learn and share
   - Based on simple peer-to-peer prompts
   - Designed to build visibility, trust, and relationships
   - Provides a gentle, low-barrier entry point into the broader exchange system

2. **Commitment Pool**
   - A shared space where people publicly commit to things they're willing to do or offer
   - When commitments are fulfilled, participants earn credits
   - Credits can be redeemed for meals, services, support, or other offerings from the pool
   - Structured, but community-governed and transparent

People can participate in either or both. Events and gatherings serve as both social infrastructure and coordination rituals.

## 3. Connection Circles

Connection Circles are a continuation of our Human Library work—but with even more flexibility and clarity. There are just two guiding questions:

What do you want to learn or explore?
What do you want to teach or share?

These can be written on post-it notes, added to a shared board, or offered aloud in small groups.

Participants then organically form conversations in pairs or small groups around shared themes. The goal isn't a perfect match, but a spark of curiosity. Some will be one-time connections; others may evolve into workshop ideas, mentorships, or entries into the commitment pool.

## 4. Commitment Pool

The commitment pool is a shared ledger—digital or physical—where people pledge something they're willing to offer. When their commitment is fulfilled, they receive credits.

Examples of commitments:

"I'll volunteer at the next Repair Café."
"I can sew small clothing repairs."
"I'll help weed a community garden bed."
"I can offer 1 hour of graphic design or web help."
"I'll facilitate a workshop on how to use mutual aid tech."
"I'll do peer listening for someone going through a hard time."

These commitments can be offered openly or in response to someone's request. Fulfilled commitments are confirmed by a steward, and credits are issued to the contributor.

## 5. The Credit System

In Community Exchange, we use a simple credit system to track fulfilled contributions and reward participants.

- 1 credit = 30 minutes of meaningful work OR $10 of value
- Credits are only issued after commitments are fulfilled
- All credits are whole numbers (no fractions)

Credits can be used to:
- Redeem help from other pool participants (e.g. childcare, rides, tech support)
- Access meals at Reimagine Co
- Attend workshops or events

Tool lending is not part of the credit system—it remains part of the Tool Library's flat-fee model.

## 6. How Money Enters the Pool

The system also accepts fiat (real-world money), which can support the pool's operations and reimburse contributors like Reimagine Co.

Fiat can enter in three ways:
1. As a commitment – "I'll donate $20/month to the pool"
2. In exchange for credits – "I give $50 and receive 5 credits"
3. As a gift – no credits issued; funds support the pool's health and access

This helps add liquidity and support anchor contributors.

## 7. Redemption and Inflation Management

Currently, only Reimagine Co can redeem credits for cash (e.g. when meals are purchased with credits). These redemptions may be at full or partial value—for example:

1 credit = $8 cash redemption

This helps protect the pool from over-extraction

To reduce the risk of inflation:
- Credit redemptions are capped or require steward approval
- Cash entering the pool is tracked alongside credits issued
- Participants are encouraged to spend credits in the community first, not redeem for fiat

In the future, other groups or individuals may be eligible to redeem credits, pending governance decisions.

## 8. ICS Participation

ICS plays a key role by:
- Issuing credits to volunteers at events like the Repair Café
- Optionally backing those credits with full or partial cash (e.g. 50% backing)
- Logging and stewarding contributions through the pool

This increases volunteer retention and connects ICS programming to a broader network of mutual support.

## 9. Reimagine Co Participation

Reimagine offers meals to the pool (e.g. 20/month), which people can access with credits. These credits are then redeemed by Reimagine for partial or full cash reimbursement from the pool treasury.

This approach:
- Expands meal access
- Brings new participants into the ecosystem
- Demonstrates the power of local value circulation

## 10. Membership Integration

Reimagine, in conjunction with The Hive, is considering launching a membership program:
- $33/month = access to events and co-working
- Optional: commit 2 hours/month to the pool
- Members who fulfill their commitment receive credits

This gives members more than just passive access—it invites them into a living economy of care.

## 11. Stewardship & Governance

Stewards are responsible for:
- Onboarding new participants
- Tracking commitments, fulfilments, and credit issuance
- Supporting smooth communication and dispute resolution
- Maintaining healthy credit supply and redemption balance

Stewards serve for fixed terms and may earn credits for their time. Governance is light, transparent, and participatory.

## 12. Visuals and Learning Tools

Supporting the Community Exchange will be:
- A diagram of the Connection Circles + Commitment Pool structure
- A flowchart showing how money and credits move
- An example of how ICS and Repair Café events integrate with the system
- A ranked chart of how credits are best spent (commons-preferred options first)
- A circulation map showing how community value flows from offers to redemptions
- A stewarding guide and policy draft for orgs wanting to participate

## 13. Risks and Design Considerations

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Credit inflation | Credit expiry, redemption friction, partial backing |
| Steward burnout | Rotating roles, credit rewards, simple admin |
| Participation inequality | Optional layers, multiple ways to contribute |
| Confusion or friction | Onboarding tools, shared language, visual aids |

## 14. What's Next

- Confirm language and naming (still open to alternatives)
- Write the narrative/lore - why should Londoners want to participate in this?
- Prepare onboarding materials for pilot participants
- Host the first Connection Circle + Pool Gathering
- Launch with 10–20 contributors and build trust through use
- Iterate based on real-world feedback and steward insight
