*A pattern for implementing secure, private payment systems to support social impact projects in challenging environments*

**Privacy Payments** are systems for distributing resources privately and reliably in challenging contexts, using smart contracts and cryptocurrency infrastructure. This enables organizations to work effectively when traditional financial systems are compromised or inaccessible.

---

## Problem / Solution Context

Both grassroots projects and institutional funders face increasing challenges in resource distribution. Traditional banking infrastructure can become inaccessible due to political pressure, infrastructure breakdown, or systemic exclusion. Even when accessible, financial surveillance may put recipients at risk or prevent funders from supporting critical work. 

Organizations such as the [International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)](https://www.icrc.org/en) and the UN's [World Food Program](https://www.wfp.org/) and [OCHA](https://www.unocha.org/) have published works highlighting the difficulties of distributing aid when financial surveillance and restrictions are imposed by local authorities. 

foundations particularly struggle with fund distribution in regions where banking relationships have been severed or where grantee privacy is crucial for safety. Meanwhile, community groups and aid organizations need reliable ways to receive and distribute resources without exposing participant identities or patterns of support.

[Privacy-Preserving Aid Distribution](attachments/Privacy%20Preserving%20Aid%20Distribution.pdf) has been noted as a key opportunity for [using blockchain networks in the humanitarian sector](https://www.unocha.org/publications/report/world/blockchain-humanitarian-sector-future-opportunities).

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has highlighted the difficulties of distributing aid under heavy financial surveillance and restrictions imposed by local authorities [1](attachments/Privacy%20Preserving%20Aid%20Distribution.pdf). Similarly, the World Food Programme (WFP) encountered significant obstacles due to disagreements with Houthi authorities over the use and control of biometric data. These cases underscore the critical need for alternative, privacy-preserving systems that can operate effectively in such complex and challenging environments.

### Solution Landscape

Several approaches exist for distributing resources in challenging environments, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.  Traditional methods, often employed by humanitarian organizations, include:

- **Paper-based systems:** These involve lists of recipients and paper vouchers. While simple to implement, they suffer from scalability issues and are easily faked, making them unsuitable for large-scale distributions or situations requiring high security.

- **Centralized digital systems:** These leverage existing digital identity management systems to track aid distribution. While improving scalability and security compared to paper-based systems, they often collect large amounts of personal data, raising significant privacy concerns and potentially jeopardizing recipients' safety.  Examples include biometric identification systems used by the UN Refugee Agency and the biometric-based Watan Card in Pakistan.

More recently, decentralized approaches have emerged to address the limitations of traditional and centralized digital systems:

- **Decentralized token-based systems:**  These systems, like the one proposed by Wang et al., utilize tokens (on smart cards or smartphones) to distribute aid while minimizing data collection and maximizing privacy.  This approach offers scalability, strong accountability, and built-in privacy guarantees.  However, it requires careful consideration of hardware and connectivity limitations, particularly in crisis-affected areas.

Privacy-Preserving Crypto Payments, as described in this pattern, offers a further evolution of decentralized approaches by leveraging the security and privacy features of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts.  This pattern is particularly advantageous when compared to the alternatives listed above in situations where:

- **High levels of privacy are paramount:**  The anonymity afforded by cryptocurrencies and privacy-enhancing technologies is crucial in contexts where financial surveillance poses a direct threat to recipients.
- **Traditional financial systems are unreliable or inaccessible:**  Cryptocurrency infrastructure can function independently of traditional banking systems, providing a resilient alternative in unstable or conflict-affected regions.
- **Cross-border payments are restricted:**  Cryptocurrency transactions can bypass certain geopolitical restrictions on traditional financial transfers.
- **Auditable transparency is required:**  While maintaining recipient privacy, smart contracts can provide a transparent and auditable record of transactions.
- **Financial System Extraction is Considerable:** Banks and other financial institutions exploit humanitarian efforts by charging fees for aid-related transactions. Distributed ledgers and decentralized finance services reduce exposure to extractive, wasteful middlemen thus amplifying the impact of deployed funds.

## How Privacy Payments Work

This pattern describes how to implement secure, private payment systems using smart contracts and cryptocurrency infrastructure to distribute resources reliably in challenging contexts where traditional financial systems are compromised or inaccessible.

### Mechanism

Privacy Payments leverage blockchain technology to create a system where funds are transferred privately and securely. The core mechanism involves three interconnected components: a secure treasury management system, a privacy-preserving distribution infrastructure, and robust security controls.

This approach avoids the creation of centralized databases containing sensitive recipient information, a key vulnerability of traditional digital aid distribution systems. Instead, recipients receive tokens (either on smart cards or smartphones) representing their entitlement to aid. These tokens are then used at distribution points to claim aid, minimizing the information revealed to distribution staff and preventing the creation of digital traces linking recipients to their aid receipt.

The use of smart contracts further enhances the system’s functionality. Smart contracts can automate the release of funds based on pre-defined criteria, ensuring that aid is distributed according to established protocols and enabling auditable transparency without compromising recipient privacy. The immutability of the blockchain ensures that the record of transactions is tamper-proof, providing a reliable audit trail. This addresses the auditability challenge highlighted in the ICRC’s research [1](attachments/Privacy%20Preserving%20Aid%20Distribution.pdf).

Furthermore, the decentralized nature of blockchain technology offers resilience against disruptions to traditional financial systems. This is particularly valuable in unstable or conflict-affected regions where banking infrastructure may be unreliable or inaccessible. The use of cryptocurrencies allows for cross-border payments to bypass certain geopolitical restrictions, further enhancing the system’s flexibility and reach.

#### Affordances

Privacy Payments offer several key advantages:

- **Enhanced Privacy:** The system minimizes the collection and storage of personal data, protecting recipients from surveillance and potential harm. Pseudonymous transactions and privacy-enhancing technologies (like mixers and coinjoins) further enhance anonymity.
    
- **Improved Security:** Blockchain technology and smart contracts provide a secure and tamper-proof system for managing and distributing funds, reducing the risk of fraud and theft. Multi-signature wallets and robust key management protocols add an extra layer of security.
    
- **Increased Scalability:** The system can handle large-scale distributions efficiently, unlike traditional paper-based systems. The use of smart contracts automates many processes, reducing the administrative burden.
    
- **Enhanced Transparency and Auditability:** Smart contracts provide a transparent and auditable record of all transactions, allowing for verification of fund distribution without compromising recipient privacy.
    
- **Resilience:** The decentralized nature of the system makes it more resilient to disruptions in traditional financial systems. It can function effectively even in unstable or conflict-affected regions.
    
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** By reducing reliance on intermediaries and automating processes, the system can lead to significant cost savings, especially compared to traditional methods. This aligns with the UN OCHA’s emphasis on cost savings in humanitarian operations [2](https://app.khoj.dev/blockchain-humanitarian-opportunities.md).

### Risks and Opportunities

Implementing Privacy Payments presents several challenges:

1. **Political/Legal Risk:** Navigating regulatory complexities surrounding cryptocurrencies, ensuring compliance with AML/KYC regulations, and establishing clear documentation of charitable purpose are crucial. Maintaining jurisdictional diversity in infrastructure to mitigate regulatory risks is also important.
2. **Technical Operations:** Secure key management, user training on secure wallet operation, and maintaining system security through updates and penetration testing are essential. Addressing hardware and connectivity limitations, as highlighted by the ICRC’s research [1](https://app.khoj.dev/aid-distribution-paper(1).md), is also critical.
3. **Organizational Security:** Protecting participant identities, securing communications, and establishing robust incident response protocols are vital for maintaining the integrity and security of the system.

Addressing these risks is crucial for successful implementation. However, the potential benefits of enhanced privacy, security, scalability, and resilience outweigh the challenges, particularly in contexts where traditional financial systems are inadequate or pose significant risks to vulnerable populations. The potential for cost savings and increased efficiency also makes this approach attractive for humanitarian and social impact projects.

)
```

### Implementation

The foundation of this pattern consists of three interconnected systems:

1. **Treasury Management**
   - Multi-signature wallets with designated key holders
   - Clear separation between public and private funds
   - Emergency recovery procedures
   - Leveraging tools like Gnosis Safe or similar wallets with programmable logic for fund allocation

   Best practices include ensuring backups of private keys are encrypted and stored in diverse, secure locations. For compliance, documenting charitable purposes and creating auditable trails for cryptocurrency transactions are crucial.

2. **Distribution Infrastructure**
   - Private cryptocurrency wallets for recipients (e.g., Wasabi or Samourai for Bitcoin, or hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor)
   - Smart contracts governing fund releases, such as Gnosis or Aragon-based DAOs
   - Verification systems that preserve privacy through zero-knowledge proofs or decentralized identity solutions (e.g., zk-SNARKs)

   These tools allow both institutional and grassroots actors to preserve recipient anonymity while meeting audit requirements where needed. The use of mixers, coinjoins, or other privacy-enhancing technologies (like Privacy Pools) can mitigate risks from blockchain analysis.

3. **Security Controls**
   - Robust key management procedures with access controls for multisig wallets
   - Redundancy in backup systems for wallets and key recovery
   - Regular security audits focusing on both the smart contract code and overall system architecture

   Examples of specific measures include encrypted messaging (e.g., Signal or Matrix) for operational communication and hardware security modules for critical wallet operations.

Implementation strategies vary:
- Institutional funders often establish a separate legal entity to handle cryptocurrency operations, ensuring clear separation from traditional financial activities.
- Grassroots organizations may begin with pilots focused on a specific, immediate need, gradually scaling infrastructure as capacity and familiarity grow
