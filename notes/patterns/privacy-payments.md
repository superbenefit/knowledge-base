*A pattern for implementing secure, private payment systems to support social impact projects in challenging environments*

**Privacy Payments** are systems for distributing resources privately and reliably in challenging contexts, using smart contracts and cryptocurrency infrastructure. This enables organizations to work effectively when traditional financial systems are compromised or inaccessible.

---

## Problem / Solution Context

Both grassroots projects and institutional funders face increasing challenges in resource distribution. Traditional banking infrastructure can become inaccessible due to political pressure, infrastructure breakdown, or systemic exclusion. Even when accessible, financial surveillance may put recipients at risk or prevent funders from supporting critical work.

Philanthropic organizations and foundations particularly struggle with fund distribution in regions where banking relationships have been severed or where grantee privacy is crucial for safety. Meanwhile, community groups and aid organizations need reliable ways to receive and distribute resources without exposing participant identities or patterns of support.

This pattern becomes relevant when any of these conditions are present:
- Banking infrastructure is unreliable or inaccessible
- Financial surveillance puts participants at risk
- Cross-border payments are blocked or monitored
- Institutional funders need privacy-preserving grant distribution
- Recipients require protection from targeting or harassment
- Grassroots projects need to mask donor-recipient relationships to prevent reprisal

**Examples of regulatory and political scenarios:**
- Regions under heavy financial surveillance due to geopolitical tensions
- Restrictions imposed by authoritarian governments to control civil society funding
- Regions classified under international sanctions where humanitarian exemptions apply

%% Describe affordances here %%

### Risks and Opportunities

Key challenges fall into three categories:

1. **Political/Legal Risk**
   - Establishing clear documentation of charitable purpose
   - Implementing necessary compliance programs for tax authorities, particularly where cryptocurrency may raise regulatory scrutiny
   - Maintaining jurisdictional diversity in infrastructure, with hosting spread across friendly regulatory environments
   - Compliance frameworks like FATF guidelines can guide AML/KYC adherence without compromising operational privacy.

2. **Technical Operations**
   - Managing private keys securely, particularly in volatile contexts
   - Training non-technical users to operate wallets and interfaces safely
   - Maintaining system security through constant updates and penetration testing
   - Proven training programs like the Electronic Frontier Foundation's digital security curriculum have been successful.

3. **Organizational Security**
   - Protecting participant identities through pseudonymous transactions
   - Securing communications through encrypted tools like PGP or hardware tokens
   - Managing operational security with incident response protocols and layered permissions for wallet access

Organizations have successfully implemented measures like incorporating Tor or VPNs into their operational workflows to obscure transaction origination points.

### Strategies for Privacy-Preserving Crypto Payments

%% Describe how this Pattern is used in strategies/playbooks here %%

```dataview
LIST description
WHERE contains(patterns, this.file.name)
AND (
    !contains(file.path, "tools/") 
    AND !contains(file.path, "drafts/")
)
AND (
    contains(type, "playbook") OR
    (type = "playbook")
)
```

### Implementation

The foundation of this pattern consists of three interconnected systems:

1. **Treasury Management**
   - Multi-signature wallets with designated key holders
   - Clear separation between public and private funds
   - Emergency recovery procedures
   - Leveraging tools like Gnosis Safe or similar wallets with programmable logic for fund allocation

   Best practices include ensuring backups of private keys are encrypted and stored in diverse, secure locations. For compliance, documenting charitable purposes and creating auditable trails for cryptocurrency transactions are crucial.

2. **Distribution Infrastructure**
   - Private cryptocurrency wallets for recipients (e.g., Wasabi or Samourai for Bitcoin, or hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor)
   - Smart contracts governing fund releases, such as Gnosis or Aragon-based DAOs
   - Verification systems that preserve privacy through zero-knowledge proofs or decentralized identity solutions (e.g., zk-SNARKs)

   These tools allow both institutional and grassroots actors to preserve recipient anonymity while meeting audit requirements where needed. The use of mixers, coinjoins, or other privacy-enhancing technologies (like Privacy Pools) can mitigate risks from blockchain analysis.

3. **Security Controls**
   - Robust key management procedures with access controls for multisig wallets
   - Redundancy in backup systems for wallets and key recovery
   - Regular security audits focusing on both the smart contract code and overall system architecture

   Examples of specific measures include encrypted messaging (e.g., Signal or Matrix) for operational communication and hardware security modules for critical wallet operations.

Implementation strategies vary:
- Institutional funders often establish a separate legal entity to handle cryptocurrency operations, ensuring clear separation from traditional financial activities.
- Grassroots organizations may begin with pilots focused on a specific, immediate need, gradually scaling infrastructure as capacity and familiarity grow

#### Primitives for Privacy-Preserving Crypto Payments

%% Add an overview of primitives used here %%

```dataviewjs
const ext = dv.pages('"tools/types"')
    .where(t => t.extends === "primitive")
    .map(t => t.file.name);

dv.table(
    ["Primitive", "Description"],
    dv.pages()
        .where(p => 
            p.type && 
            (p.type.includes("primitive") || ext.some(n => p.type.includes(n))) &&
            dv.current().primitives && dv.current().primitives.includes(p.file.name) &&
            !p.file.path.startsWith("tools/") && 
            !p.file.path.startsWith("drafts/")
        )
        .sort(p => p.title, 'asc')
        .map(p => [
            `**[${p.title}](${p.file.path})**`,  
            p.description
        ])
);
```
