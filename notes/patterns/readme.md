# Patterns Directory

Welcome to the patterns directory, your practical guide to implementing organizational patterns. While our [main patterns index](notes/patterns/patterns.md) explores the theory and relationships between patterns, this guide focuses on how to use, document, and contribute to our pattern library.

## Getting Started

Patterns bridge the gap between theory and practice in organizational design. Each pattern in this directory represents a proven solution to common challenges, tested and refined through real-world implementation. Whether you're building a new organization or evolving an existing one, patterns provide reliable building blocks for your journey.

### Finding the Right Pattern

Start by identifying your current needs:
1. Browse the patterns directory for solutions that match your challenge
2. Check the scale and phase annotations to ensure fit
3. Review the implementation examples and case studies
4. Consider how the pattern might interact with your existing practices

Our pattern collection grows through community contribution and refinement. Each pattern documents not just what works, but why it works and how it can be adapted to different contexts.

## Contributing

Have you discovered a new pattern or refined an existing one? We welcome contributions that help our pattern library evolve. Here's how to share your knowledge:

Start by creating a new file in the `/drafts/` directory using this structure:

```yaml
title: Pattern Name
description: A concise description of what the pattern achieves
url: Optional link to external resources
tags:
  - patterns
publish: false
type: pattern
functions: What organizational functions this pattern serves
qualities: Key characteristics and benefits
scale: What organizational scale this works at
phase: Which development phases it's suitable for
primitives: List of primitives this pattern uses
```

Document your pattern with clear examples, implementation guidance, and real-world cases. Once your draft is ready, submit it for community review.

## Directory Structure
