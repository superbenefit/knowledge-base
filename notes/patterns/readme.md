*Part of the DAO Primitives Framework - Building better organizations through proven patterns*

# Patterns Directory

This directory provides a practical guide to implementing organizational patterns. While our [main patterns index](notes/patterns/patterns.md) explores the theoretical underpinnings and relationships between patterns, this README focuses on how to use, document, and contribute to our pattern library.

## Getting Started

Patterns bridge the gap between theory and practice in organizational design. Each pattern in this directory represents a proven solution to common challenges, tested and refined through real-world implementation. Whether you're building a new organization or evolving an existing one, patterns provide reliable building blocks for your journey.

### Finding the Right Pattern

To find the patterns most relevant to your needs, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Your Challenge:** Clearly define the specific organizational problem you're trying to solve.
2. **Browse the Directory:** Explore the patterns directory, looking for solutions that address your challenge.
3. **Check Annotations:** Pay attention to the `scale` and `phase` annotations to ensure the pattern is appropriate for your organization's size and stage of development.
4. **Review Examples and Case Studies:** Examine the implementation examples and case studies provided to understand how the pattern has been successfully applied in different contexts.
5. **Consider Interactions:**  Think about how the pattern might interact with your existing organizational practices and structures.

## Contributing

Have you discovered a new pattern or refined an existing one? We welcome contributions that help our pattern library evolve. Here's how to share your knowledge:

Start by creating a new file in the `/drafts/` directory using this structure:

```yaml
title: Pattern Name
description: A concise description of what the pattern achieves
url: Optional link to external resources
tags:
  - patterns
publish: false
type: pattern
functions: What organizational functions this pattern serves
qualities: Key characteristics and benefits
scale: What organizational scale this works at
phase: Which development phases it's suitable for
primitives: List of primitives this pattern uses
```

Document your pattern with clear examples, implementation guidance, and real-world cases. Once your draft is ready, submit it for community review.
