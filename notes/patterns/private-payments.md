A system for distributing resources privately and reliably in challenging contexts, using smart contracts and cryptocurrency infrastructure. This enables organizations to work effectively when traditional financial systems are compromised or inaccessible.

---

## Context

Both grassroots projects and institutional funders face increasing challenges in resource distribution. Traditional banking infrastructure can become inaccessible due to political pressure, infrastructure breakdown, or systemic exclusion. Even when accessible, financial surveillance may put recipients at risk or prevent funders from supporting critical work.

Philanthropic organizations and foundations particularly struggle with fund distribution in regions where banking relationships have been severed or where grantee privacy is crucial for safety. Meanwhile, community groups and aid organizations need reliable ways to receive and distribute resources without exposing participant identities or patterns of support.

This pattern becomes relevant when any of these conditions are present:
- Banking infrastructure is unreliable or inaccessible
- Financial surveillance puts participants at risk
- Cross-border payments are blocked or monitored
- Institutional funders need privacy-preserving grant distribution
- Recipients require protection from targeting or harassment

[PROMPT: What other specific conditions make this pattern necessary? Are there particular regulatory or political scenarios we should highlight?]

## Implementation

The foundation of this pattern consists of three interconnected systems:

1. Treasury Management
- Multi-signature wallets with designated key holders
- Clear separation between public and private funds
- Emergency recovery procedures
[PROMPT: What are the specific treasury management tools and platforms that have proven effective?]

2. Distribution Infrastructure
- Private cryptocurrency wallets for recipients
- Smart contracts governing fund releases
- Verification systems that preserve privacy
[PROMPT: Can you provide details on specific smart contract implementations that have worked well?]

3. Security Controls
- Key management procedures
- Backup systems
- Regular security audits
[PROMPT: What specific security protocols have organizations successfully implemented?]

For institutional funders, implementation typically begins with establishing a separate legal entity for cryptocurrency operations, followed by building technical infrastructure. Grassroots organizations often start with small pilot programs focused on immediate needs.

[PROMPT: Can you share specific examples of successful implementation sequences?]

## Challenges & Solutions

Key challenges fall into three categories:

1. Political/Legal Risk
- Establishing clear documentation of charitable purpose
- Implementing necessary compliance programs
- Maintaining jurisdictional diversity in infrastructure
[PROMPT: What specific compliance frameworks have worked in different contexts?]

2. Technical Operations
- Managing private keys securely
- Training non-technical users
- Maintaining system security
[PROMPT: What specific training programs or protocols have proven effective?]

3. Organizational Security
- Protecting participant identities
- Securing communications
- Managing operational security
[PROMPT: What specific operational security measures have organizations successfully implemented?]

## Case Studies

[PROMPT: We need detailed case studies that include:
- Specific implementation examples
- Technical details of solutions deployed
- Actual challenges faced and overcome
- Measurable outcomes
Please provide any case studies you're aware of, with as much detail as possible while protecting operational security.]

## Elements of Private Payments

%% Introduce the tools, rules and practices used in this pattern here %%

### Private Payments Primitives

```dataviewjs
const ext = dv.pages('"tools/types"')
    .where(t => t.extends === "primitive")
    .map(t => t.file.name);

dv.table(
    ["Primitive", "Description"],
    dv.pages()
        .where(p => 
            p.type && 
            (p.type.includes("primitive") || ext.some(n => p.type.includes(n))) &&
            dv.current().primitives && dv.current().primitives.includes(p.file.name) &&
            !p.file.path.startsWith("tools/") && 
            !p.file.path.startsWith("drafts/")
        )
        .sort(p => p.title, 'asc')
        .map(p => [
            `**[${p.title}](${p.file.path})**`,  
            p.description
        ])
);
```

WHERE contains(patterns, this.file.name)
AND (
    !contains(file.path, "tools/") 
    AND !contains(file.path, "drafts/")
)
