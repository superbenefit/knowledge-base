# Contributing to the Web3 Library

This document outlines the process for adding new entries to SuperBenefit's web3 library and reviewing existing draft entries.

## Overview

The web3 library serves as a curated collection of high-quality external resources that inform our work on decentralized organizations, governance, and social impact. Each library entry follows a consistent format to ensure clarity and usefulness for our community.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Resource Evaluation

Before creating a new library entry, evaluate whether the resource is a good fit using the [Resource Evaluation Framework](/notes/prompts/resource-evaluation.md) prompt.

This evaluation should consider:
- Alignment with SuperBenefit's focus areas
- Uniqueness compared to existing resources
- Quality and depth of content
- Actionability and practical value
- Currency and relevance

### 2. Creating a New Entry

Once a resource has been approved for inclusion, use the [Web3 Library Entry Creation](/notes/prompts/library-entry-creation.md) prompt to create a new entry following our standardized format.

Each entry should include:
- Complete metadata (title, description, type, source, author, tags)
- An introductory paragraph
- Key highlights (5+ bullet points)
- Practical applications section
- Connection With SuperBenefit section (2-4 concise bullet points)

### 3. Review Process

New entries should be:
1. Created in the `/notes/links` directory for team review
2. Reviewed by at least one other team member
3. Moved to the main `/links` directory once approved
