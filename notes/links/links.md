# Web3 Library (Working Draft)

This directory serves as a staging area for web3 library entries that are being prepared for the main [links library](/links/links.md). Entries here are undergoing team review for format, content quality, and metadata consistency before being moved to the permanent library location.

## Purpose

The `/notes/links` directory allows us to:

- Collaboratively develop new library entries
- Test formatting and ensure consistency
- Review content for accuracy and relevance to SuperBenefit's focus areas
- Ensure proper tagging and metadata before public release

## How to Use This Section

Browse through the entries in this directory to review draft library resources. Feel free to provide feedback on any entry by submitting suggestions via GitHub issues or pull requests. 

If you'd like to contribute new entries, please see our [contribution guidelines](/notes/links/contributing.md) which outline the process and templates to use.

## Current Status

We currently have 10 entries in various stages of review. These entries cover key resources on governance frameworks, organizational patterns, and coordination systems relevant to SuperBenefit's work on decentralized organization and the cosmolocal movement.
