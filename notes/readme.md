# Notes Directory

This is our working documentation space where active research and project development happens. Unlike the polished content in `/artifacts/`, this directory contains in-progress work and project-specific materials.

## Active Projects

### DAO Primitives Project
- `/primitives/` - Research into DAO building blocks, patterns, and frameworks
- Documents fundamental components of DAO organization
- Develops conceptual frameworks for understanding scale and evolution
- See the project's [readme](primitives/readme.md) for details

### Reimagining Power Project
- `/rpp/` - Project documentation and research
- See project directory for details

## Working Here

The notes directory is where ideas develop before becoming published artifacts. This means:
- Content is actively evolving
- Documentation can be experimental
- Cross-linking between projects is encouraged
- New insights feed into published materials

Start new work in `/drafts/` before moving it here. Once content is refined and validated, consider moving it to `/artifacts/` for publication.

## Contributing

- Use templates from `/tools/templates/`
- Follow standards in `/tools/types/`
- Start experimental content in `/drafts/`
- Link liberally to related materials
