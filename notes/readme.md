*Active research and project development space - where ideas evolve into artifacts.*

# Notes Directory

This directory serves as the active workspace for developing knowledge resources related to DAO organization.  Unlike the polished content in `/artifacts/`, this directory contains in-progress work and project-specific materials.  Knowledge typically flows from `/drafts/` to `/notes/`, then to `/artifacts/` after refinement and community validation.

---

## Active Projects

This directory currently focuses on three key areas:

* **DAO Primitives Project (`/primitives/`):** Research into the fundamental building blocks of DAO organization, including core concepts, frameworks for understanding context and application (phase, scale, state), and the relationships between primitives and patterns.  [See the project's README](artifacts/primitives/readme.md) for details.

## Contributing

The `/notes/` directory is the heart of our collaborative knowledge-building process. Your contributions here directly shape the development of our learning resources and help us refine our understanding of DAO organization.  By contributing, you're not just adding content; you're actively participating in the evolution of our collective knowledge and helping to create valuable resources for our stakeholders.

Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Identify an Area of Focus:** Choose a project within the `/notes/` directory (e.g., DAO Primitives, Patterns, Playbooks) that aligns with your interests and expertise.

2. **Review Existing Documentation:** Familiarize yourself with the existing content and structure within your chosen area.  This will help you identify gaps, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement.

3. **Develop Your Contribution:** Use the appropriate templates from `/tools/templates/` and follow the metadata standards in `/tools/types/` to create your contribution.

4. **Submit Your Contribution:**  Once your contribution is ready, follow the detailed guidelines in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file to submit it for review and integration into the knowledge base.


Your contributions are invaluable to our collective learning and the creation of high-quality resources.  We encourage you to participate actively in this process.
