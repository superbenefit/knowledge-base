**The invitations - There is much to do, and we’re ready. SuperBenefit’s governance structure, community onboarding, and project squads are already at work. We invite you to join in one or more of the following ways.**
**Invitation 1: Landscaping and map-making our future and how we get there **Illustrators, sense-makers, story-tellers, system designers let’s go on an adventure. When we talk about web3, the [pluriverse](http://pluriverse.world/)pluriverse, or making better, what do we really mean? Together, we’ll illustrate a landscape of examples of foundations being built, and the pieces coming together. On another plane, we’ll imagine and illustrate what the abundant and equitable future we hope for will contain and be built on. In between those, our adventure will take us toward discovering what’s missing, what’s emerging, and where the opportunities are to build new flywheels that accelerate the arrival of this better future.
**Invitation 2: A token of governance and interdependence **Governance explorers, facilitators, and communities of common purpose, we are embarking on a new era of interdependence, crafting tokens that we will use to weave relationships among ourselves, allied communities, and the contributors yet to come. The design of our systems of governance that enable self-management and organization are themselves critical infrastructure for the world ahead and our role in it. Let’s use this opportunity to craft, test, and evolve these practices together. 
**Invitation 3: The participation drop **Developers and artists, there’s a story, a moment, and an opportunity for everyone, every wallet, regardless of background, resources, and identity to participate in the movement of making better faster. Let’s go beyond basic tokens and design a ticket to contribute to creating this future together. Let’s imagine ways to use these tickets to bring us together, engage our talents and skills, swarm and adventure together in ways that get our new flywheels spinning.
**Invitation 4: The commitment drop **Developers, marketers, and artists, there’s another story and moment emerging here to engage companies, institutions, and endowments that want to be part of this future, but are still responsible to the old world they created. While they may be slow to change themselves, let’s give them a way to meaningfully demonstrate and contribute to the new future emerging here. 
**Invitation 5: A metacurrency and value infrastructure **DeFi architects, our future is our greatest asset. What if we had a metacurrency that made it easy to be invested in that future. What kind of infrastructure might this future need to flow resources, unlock nascent and underappreciated value, and invest deeply in these new foundations to strengthen their resilience, foster their interdependence, and strengthen the foundations for all who are building toward this future we aspire. What brave new realms might we enter? What magic might you unlock?
**Over the last several months we’ve been preparing the foundations** to extend these invitations and welcome you as part of this journey. However you’re drawn and whatever your craft, skills, and interest, if an invitation appeals, you belong.
