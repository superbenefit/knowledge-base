# Background
SuperBenefit has been in development since summer 2021 with significant contributions made since by several different members of the community. With the upcoming launch of #[[$sprb]] we want to fairly recognize the contributions of those members by distributing an allocation to them.
There is much written and experience already on contributor recognition in DAOs. It would be helpful to have a short summary of the approaches we might consider in allocating #[[$sprb]] to past contributors.
# Desired Results
A short report prepared in notion or google docs that provides a summary of available options and their pros and cons drawn from existing best practice. Starting points to uncover potential practices include:
- [https://tecommons.org/](https://tecommons.org/) 
- [https://coordinape.com/](https://coordinape.com/) 
- [https://creators.mirror.xyz/Le68ptgaqsBh1g6w8UqqVL2kIrA_Lqn37bELMO-W_-0](https://creators.mirror.xyz/Le68ptgaqsBh1g6w8UqqVL2kIrA_Lqn37bELMO-W_-0) 

The report should include enough information to be able to draft a proposal for implementing retroactive contributor recognition.
