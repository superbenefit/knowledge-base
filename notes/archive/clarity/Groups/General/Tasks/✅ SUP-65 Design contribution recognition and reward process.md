Process Objectives
- Ensure core contributors are able to surface their contributions
- Enable core contributors to contribute to shaping the final allocation

Process Flow
- Create a document to list contributions of core contributors to date (and also any other contributors that have made a meaningful allocation they feel should be rewarded) #[[151 Pre-launch contribution register]] 
- Use [coordinape](http://coordinape.com) to allow core contributors to collectively determine the allocation
	- Contributors should vote on how they perceive the value contributed to:
		- the creation of SuperBenefit
		- the work that led to completion of Revolution 0
		- the support provided to you in your work
	- Resulting allocation determines the allocation of the remaining 800,000 SPRB associated with rev0 contributors (see #[[$sprb]])
- #[[treasury squad]] submits a proposal to allocate the tokens based on the vote
