#[[P-236 Krause House Collaboration]]
Context
As part of the Krause House collaboration approved in [SB9](https://snapshot.org/#/superbenefit.eth/proposal/0x2301700340ba5308ae61346ce43ac4d22ab853b9f53603e7a3da050b3f11adbd), Alex H and Lewwwk wish to engage Shadoe from [Five and Dime](https://www.fiveanddime.co.nz) to illustrate and design the "transformation map", the primary Future of Sport project output.
This will be of significant value in helping to communicate the substance of the output and ensure a quality representation of the input and contributions to the project.  It will also serve as valuable reference example of the work of the SuperBenefit community, and could potentially provide a template for comparable work in different contexts.
Details
We request a budget set-aside of $1,000 USDC for the completion of this work. Alex H will manage the relationship and budget, with final costs to be requested from treasury upon completion, up to a maximum of $1,000 USDC.
