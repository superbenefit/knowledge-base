## Triage Items
- What tensions do you have that need resolution to move forward in your work?
	- Scepticism about web3
		- There are lots of ponzis, scams and bad actors. Even "good" projects may be bad for the world. Advocates speak about web3 over-zealously. ETH gas cost makes NFTs and web3 inaccessible. SB has maybe not done enough to differentiate itself from what else is going on in web3 & make clear its vision for making better faster.
	- Day/Time of future meetings
	- Tensions about how things are progressing with the project
		- We're pushing an elephant :) 
- Review #[[cxi agenda]] and triage items for future conversations
