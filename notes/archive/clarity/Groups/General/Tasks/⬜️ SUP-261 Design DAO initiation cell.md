What is the minimum required coordination necessary for grantees to allocation $1M to the community for them to pursue systems transformation?
**Potential Framework**
1. Determine 'community'
2. Define and agree on purpose toward which funds would be used to make progress.
3. Design and agree minimal viable governance structure.

**How it could be initialize**
1. SB establishes DAO cell with representatives of key stakeholders
	- Includes token, governance, and tooling for initiation.
2. SB hosts a community and purpose definition exercise.
	- proposed to the community and ratified.
3. SB leads draft of initial governance framework.
	- proposed to the community and ratified
4. SB implements required DAO setup to receive allocation.

**How it is resourced**
1. Sponsor acquires remaining SB NFTs
2. SB incentivizes external participation through SPRB
3. DAO cell requests a retroactive allocation or funding upon creation of the DAO


# Notes
- Next call to be on 'community' with child welfare league of canada
	- My instinct is we need to build off of rowan's stakeholder network around the beneficiary, and then explain simply how governance could be initated, and progressively rolled out... and examples of how beneficiaries might ultimately be empowered through this. E.g. anyone that was a receipient of a service may in future be able to vote on which version of that service should get more funding... or how a team might form around a new idea and be resourced to develop a proposal for an improvement.
