# Background
SuperBenefit requires an ERC20 token to enable on-chain governance, recognize contributions, and facilitate partnerships.
# Proposal
As Lead of the #[[treasury squad]] I, Lewwwk, propose that I take the action of creating the #[[$sprb]]  governance token through [coinvise.co](http://coinvise.co) with the following parameters:
- 10,000,000 fixed supply
- symbol: SPRB
- name: SuperBenefit DAO
- description: To facilitate development and governance of the SuperBenefit DAO and the pursuit of its ethos.

The resulting tokens to be sent to a [gnosis-safe.io](https://gnosis-safe.io) multi-sig address created by Lewwwk with 5 signers (AlexH, Flashlight, Lewwwk, MBaldwin, Rowan) and 3 of 5 signing policy. 
200,000 tokens will be immediately allocated evenly between existing #[[general circle]] members (AlexH, Flashlight, Heenal, Lewwwk, MBaldwin, Remarkk, Rowan, RyanC).
800,000 additional tokens will be distributed at a later date to pre-crowdfund contributors, based on an allocation to be determined by the #[[general circle]]. 
2,000,000 tokens will also be bridged to Polygon ([guide here](https://coinvise.notion.site/BRIDGE-Bridging-tokens-to-Polygon-3f371c366d074a2f85e6b8dacd59e34e)) to enable cost-effective distributions to contributors during Revolution 1.
# Decision
This proposal will be introduced into discord #proposal-submission for "fist to five" consent. 
Approved, with eight fives.

# Action
1. Multisig created: 
	- eth:0x731c837121C15e1e7e3cfc0E2588f4d0B35FdD48
2. $SPRB created: 
	- 0xfC3Ac26D9A4A00B2534298c933A84F54430B3850
