## Background
"One of the most interesting and relevant topics in the web3 space right now is how systemic resilience and collective governance is emerging and being developed right now. Diving into this feels like a perfect way to kick off SuperBenefit's Revolution 1." ~ Lewwwk
Working in parallel with #[[222 Proposal for Governance Research Project (Rev1)]], this [[governance conversations]] project proposes to hold a series of public events featuring broad exploratory conversations with people active in web3 governance, as well as with people practising governance innovation outside of web3, including but not limited to people active in the fields of Indigenous governance, co-operatives, holacracy, sociocracy, self-managed organizations, and anticipatory governance.
The events will be held as Twitter Spaces, with the days and times to be determined by the project team. We will start with a pilot series of 3 Twitter Spaces and then assess whether and how to continue.

## Proposal
**Vision (what are we hoping for this project?)** - We intend to host a series of Twitter spaces with web3 leaders and with experienced practitioners of governance in diverse fields. These discovery conversations will be a valuable tool for the web3 community to better understand the problems and opportunities in the space, and the potential for crossover with governance theory and practice outside of web3. We intend that this work will produce insights that can be shared with the broader community via Mirror posts and in collaboration with other players in the ecosystem, as well as being of value to SuperBenefit as we work towards invitations 2, 3 & 4.

**Design insight (what insights are we leveraging to do this?)** - There are tensions appearing in governance models being used across the web3 space and there is a wave of governance innovation happening to try to solve these problems. There is value in documenting, enquiring into and making sense of the innovations and shifts taking place. We will also tap into governance theory and practice throughout human history to explore the limits and potential of different approaches, surface ideas and insights about what web3 makes possible, and explore practical solutions to challenges that DAOs currently face.

**Energetic momentum (what commitment and forward momentum does project this have?)** - @Heenal, @MBaldwin and @AlexH are on board and committed to push this forward and work has already begun. We have networks into folks in other DAOs and outside of the web3 space who we will engage to partner in this work. 
### Proposal
- SuperBenefit allocates 10,000 $SPRB to the project
- Core team members will decide on where the tokens will be allocated as the project progresses with an allocation of  $SPRB to each host and speaker and the remainder distributed among the contributors.
- Tokens transferred to a new multi-sig wallet set up for use by the project
	- @MBaldwin @AlexH @heenal will be the signers on the wallet and 2/3 signatures will be required

## Action
$SPRB token holders participate in a snapshot vote
