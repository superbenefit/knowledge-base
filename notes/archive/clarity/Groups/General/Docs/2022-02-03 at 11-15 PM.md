# Hello World Launch Plan


A Miniumum Viable Plan
## Key Communication Dates
- ![image.png](1a17cecb-637e-4088-8cd1-d00c886f925d.png)
- **Tuesday Feb 22, 2022 Launch**

## Primary goal
- Publish our ethos and theory of change so that those aligned with our purpose and work can contribute to the 5 invitations in the Hello World post

### Secondary goal
- Crowdfund up to 20 ETH 

## Strategy 
- Publish Hello World post on Mirror.xyz and embed "Editions" of Robelan's "Make Better Faster" work available for purchase at denominations of 0.1, 0.25, and 1.0 ETH up to a max total of 20 ETH.
- Drive attention to the Hello World post via our personal networks and relationships (ie, no paid media)
- Activate current SB community via Discord, with summary of communication strategy and key dates, with link to copy deck and/or direct posting of copy
- Post launch on Feb 22, continue to drive awareness, primarily via Twitter and targeted at web3 community
- Post stays active until such time as 20 ETH is raised, at which point Editions can no longer be purchased
