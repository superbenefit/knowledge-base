- Tension around financial incentives and centralization of wealth, are replacing decentralized systems that lead to the same outcomes, if in early or in club there is an accumulation of wealth, no talk about land/ecology it is an after thought, individualistic nature of NFT purchasing, ownership conversation - not questioning ownership itself 
	- Host a conversation about ownership and decolonization - SB Cafe Chat and Twitter Spaces
- infrastructure of the future for what purpose - why do we need - part of our story - what is broken - social, enviro, economy, better systems with a purpose of justice and equity, through social and financial flywheels, not bureaucratic, scale of UN and World Bank may not be relatable
