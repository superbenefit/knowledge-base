SB Governance Principles ([Source](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/work/7)):
- We start simple in a way that can cascade out over time
- We work transparently in public with the community consulted at key moments
- We prioritize momentum even over perfection
- We watch out for each others' blindspots as this process unfolds
- Role fillers learn and practice giving and receiving Feedback early and often
- We work to put SuperBenefit under full Contributor governance control as soon as practical
