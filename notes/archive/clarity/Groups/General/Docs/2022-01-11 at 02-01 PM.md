Here are 30 questions for builders to consider as they design the MX for their DAOs: 

- What is your DAO's value proposition to members? 
- What key messages need to be delivered during onboarding?
- How will you keep engagement high after the initial 2 week honeymoon period?
- How can you personalise the new member's experience
- What language is specific to your DAO (e.g. roles, guilds, etc)?
- What expectations will new joiners have? How will you meet/exceed those expectations?
- How can you make your DAO more accessible to those with little Web3 experience?
- Why would someone join your DAO vs. any other?
- What is your DAO’s narrative? How is it communicated?
- What learning goals will your DAO help people accomplish?
- How are you taming the firehose of information for members?
- How will members meet each other?
- How will you create community wins for all members to take pride in?
- How are you building trust between members?
