**Initial development of our opportunity sense-making apparatus **
1. Defining web3 infrastructure
2. Creating a schema for understanding web3 infrastructure opportunities across a set of typologies 
	1. The "web3 stack" - a typology that lays out the layers of abstraction within web3. This creates the ability to categorise opportunities and tailor approaches appropriately
	2. Scaling mechanisms - a typology of mechanisms for generating scale in web3 infrastructure. These will differentiate between specific scaling mechanisms that produce fundamentally different dynamics. The ability to categorise opportunities based on this is necessary to be able to assess risks and likelihood of success
	3. Impact mechanisms - a typology of the different mechanisms that can be employed to deliver impact. Resting on schemas like Donella Meadows' work on 12 leverage points
	4. Stage - developing a model for understand the stage of development for infrastructure
	5. Support methods - cataloging the different ways that we might support opportunities via the SB network
3. Based on this set of typologies develop a framework for assessing and supporting opportunities. The goal of this being that it evolve into a shared network resource that will allow resources to flow efficiently across the network to effectively support the development of high leverage web3 infrastructure

**First prototype of selection and allocation process**
1. Develop a prototype programme to support a number of infrastructure opportunities 
	- Work across the different SB squads and the broader SB network to coordinate selection and support of a set of opportunities
	- Note - The details of this will change significantly as we progress with the initial development of typologies and other SB activities, including possible token raises that may provide resources to deploy to opportunties
