>This document is WIP. The conceptual framework for the DAO Primitives project will be documented here.
## About This Guide
- This guide is intended to help organizations adapt to the standards and practices used to experiment with collective ownership, participatory governance, decentralized coordination and other web3 concepts and technologies.
- This guide is **not** intended to provide opinions about which tools and practices to use or how to use them. Instead, this information should serve as a framework from which these opinions can be derived and implemented as practice.
- ### Assumptions
	- **Governance can be Modular, Portable and Composable**
		- Building on [Metagov](https://metagov.org/)'s conceptual framework for online governance experimentation, the DAO Primitive Framework aims to provide organizations with a clear, unopinionated path toward modular decentralization.
		- "There exists a set of shared and essential building blocks from which any governance system can be built."
