### Objective
Finalize a starting set of mission vision and values.
### Why do this?
Having a clear north star and reference point for how we do is important to allowing us to act in sync and in parallel. This v0 is meant to plant a stake based on where this idea has come from and the potential that is blinking into being.
### Approach
As the 'source' (governance lingo - see #[7 Governance Implementation](7%20Governance%20Implementation)) @Lewwwk will author the v0. Community will be invited to revisit and contribute to the existing Mission, Vision, Values contributions in the Miro. 
✅ SUP-32 Invite the community to revisit and contribute to the existing Mission, Vision, Values work in Miro
✅ SUP-33 @Lewwwk to publish and propose v0 Mission, Vision, Values.
