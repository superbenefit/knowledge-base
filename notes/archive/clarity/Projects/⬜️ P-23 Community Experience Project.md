## Problem statement

Newcomers to SuperBenefit are confused about web3 and/or they don't know where to get started. As the SB community grows, we want to make sure that contributors are engaged and feel valued. For the change that the world needs, we need to create the conditions for everyone to share their SuperPowers freely!

## Project description
The Community Hosting & Onboarding Team is building:
- a structure and set of practices to nurture the SuperBenefit community and increase its capacity for contribution

- an onboarding pathway into web3 for social benefit, leveraging existing resources

## Need
_Why is this project needed right now? What gap(s) does it fill?_
We need newcomers to SB to understand the project, to feel welcomed and excited, and understand the next steps towards participating and contributing to SB.
Currently there is a lack of internal infrastructure, process and capacity regarding onboarding and community management
## Purpose
_What is the deeper purpose of this project? Why is it important to the world?_
To create the conditions for everyone to be able to find their place and share their gifts within the SB ecosystem (in a way that is easy, fun and rewarding) and be part of co-creating a better future for all
## Principles
_What principles must we follow to ensure a successful project?_
- Open, caring, fair, abundant
- Inclusive
- Know when to go slow and when to go fast
- Bias towards action
- Curiosity, experimentation

# Outcomes

## Vision of success
SuperBenefit is known across the DAO ecosystem as an example of best practice in community management and a thought leader regarding new ways of working and creating a bridge between web3 and impact/social change movements.

# Brainstorming

## How to Build Trust
**To build a strong community, you need to build trust. To build trust, you need to get members to believe 4 things:**
1. their contributions will be put to good use.
2. the intentions behind the community are earnest.
3. the community is capable of achieving its goals.
4. the people in the community share the same values as they do.

## Roles in community
### Key Roles
- the settlers (community management - day to day operations)
- the explorers (community growth - experimentation)
- the town planners (community strategy - direction)

### Other Roles
- sensing
- welcoming/onboarding
- holding space
- ==seeding culture==
- cycles of reflection and action
- smoothing the flow of information between guilds and project teams
- planning & hosting events
- connecting with other web3 communities
- ==inviting in unheard voices==
- ==wellness & wellbeing==



## Stakeholders
- Existing contributors
- Existing Discord users
- The wider DAO ecosystem and web3 participants
- The global social impact ecosystem
- Practitioners and theorists of social change, organizational development and new ways of working
- The most marginalized peoples of the world
- All beings and the Earth itself

# Dependencies & risks

## Risks
- Burnout by leaders/contributors
- Community grows too fast without structures and practices to support it
- Not enough action 
- Not sufficiently clear narrative/Theory of Change
- Not enough ways for newcomers to get involved with work streams
- Sense of "us" and "them" between "in" and "out" groups
- Mods spend lots of time answering same questions/dealing with spam
- Work streams overlap, deadlines get missed, poor quality work delivered


## Dependencies
- Need help with Discord setup
- Need governance structures and teams/projects to be established
- Need more team members
- Need clear articulation of ToC/mission/vision to attract new members
- Need to identify gaps and needs in current workstreams

# Organising

## Insights

_What clarity is emerging through the process of planning this project? What do you know now that you didn't know before?_

- Member acquisition -> engagement -> leadership
- Communities only become real when they achieve their first win.
- Enthusiasm is not enough to keep a community alive.
- When no value is created, people disengage.
- Community is not always about including everyone but a careful balance between curation and inclusion.


## Challenges/Help needed

_What do we need help with in order to move this project forward? Who might be able to help us? Make a list._
- Experiences of other DAOs - what to go and what not to do
- More team members



## Unanswered questions
- Who is missing from SB? How could we go about broadening representation within SB and where it would be most important to do so?
- I would really like to distill our thoughts into one document - our hosting action plan, next tasks, outstanding questions..... It would be helpful to have a sense of what are all the hosting and onboarding related projects/tasks for the next 4-6 weeks.
- How to split responsibilities among the team and manage our internal operations
