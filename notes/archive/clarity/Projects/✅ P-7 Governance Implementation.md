# Overview
We are feeling the need to implement governance sooner rather than later in order to help us work better/faster and to be prepared for rapid scaling if we are successful.
# Principles
- We start simple in a way that can cascade out over time
- We work transparently in public with the community consulted at key moments
- We prioritize momentum even over perfection
- We watch out for each others' blindspots as this process unfolds
- Role fillers learn and practice giving and receiving [index](notes/aifs/feedback/index.md) early and often
- We work to put SuperBenefit under full [Contributor](Contributor) governance control as soon as practical
