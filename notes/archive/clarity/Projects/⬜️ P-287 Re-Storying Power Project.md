# Notes / Questions
- Questions from Reimagining Power meeting on the 14th:
	- How does this project relate to SuperBenefit's goal of #[G-291 Telling SuperBenefit's Story](G-291%20Telling%20SuperBenefit's%20Story)?
		- Does it relate to other projects or goals, like #[mapping pathways to the future](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/mapping%20pathways%20to%20the%20future.md)?
	- How does this project relate to the #[reimagining power](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/reimagining%20power.md)?
	- Does this squad (Michelle, Njoki, Heenal) desire/require autonomy to take on responsibilities and create within the whole of SuperBenefit DAO? Or are they wanting to collaborate strictly within the scope of the #[reimagining power](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/reimagining%20power.md) project?

# Ideas for what this project could explore
- The genesis of the Reimagining Power Cell from SuperBenefit, the Systems Transformation and Primitive Cells
- How we have reimagined - and are reimagining - power in this project
	- And how we are failing to do so/could do better
- Why is it necessary to reimagine power? Why is it necessary to reimagine power within the domains that the partners are active in?
- How can web3 enable storytelling? How can web3 enable storytelling that reimagines power?
- How can web3 make storytelling and stories more accessible?

# Potential Outputs
- Mirror posts
- Poetic harvests
- Twitter Spaces
- Website/wiki
- Discord onboarding process/flow
- Radical transparency showing the workings and progress of the project in real-time
