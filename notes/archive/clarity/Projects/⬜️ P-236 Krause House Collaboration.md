### Project Details

>üèÄ **Note:** Here is where you can go into detail.  Even still, please keep things as concise as possible.  Please be sensitive that reading proposals takes time and energy, so every extra sentence is more work for every single voter.

The sports industry and experience is undergoing a major transformation, and Krause House is at the epicentre. While our mission is clearly focused on buying and managing an NBA team, our broader influence and opportunity is becoming apparent.
Visualising and navigating transformations is both opportunity rich and challenging. This is where [SuperBenefit](http://superbenefit.org) comes in.
[SuperBenefit's mission](http://superbenefit.mirror.xyz) is to develop the social and financial flywheels that enable invention and acceleration of a better world. This includes strengthening capacities for systems change and supporting people to clarify pathways towards shared goals.¬†
Working together with Krause House, SuperBenefit proposes to lead a process through the following phases over 5-8 weeks.
1. **Discovery:** background discovery and a facilitated workshop with core, stewards, team leads, and select advisors to establish a baseline perspective on current systems and possible futures.
2. **Future and Pathway Mapping:** drafting initial representation of pathways towards a desired future of sport and the conditions that can enable action. Includes two iterations.
3. **Community and Stakeholder Feedback: **2 feedback sessions and iterations.
4. **Socialization and Adoption:** Final review and development of options for socialization and ongoing stewardship among Krause House and the broader ecosystem.

Successful completion of this project is intended to result in shared vision of the future that Krause House is an instrumental part of. That vision should provide greater clarity to Jerrys and the broader ecosystem such that Jerrys can:
- bring forward proposals with the greatest potential impact on achieving our goals
- build deeper, productive relationships across the ecosystem
- organize and orient around the highest-leverage opportunities
- efficiently mitigate and move past dead-ends and distractions
