The early purpose of this Cell is to help shape up the beginnings of the Reimagining Power project. To design the early structure and tooling for bringing the partners together to start to define and the subsequent evolution of the operational activities of the project. 
This Cell will evolve as this occurs and as proposals are passed and initiatives are spun up within the project the purpose of this Cell will change as will the make-up of its core team and contributors, its practices etc.
