# Welcome to Your Clarity Data Export
Thank you for using Clarity! This README file will guide you through the contents of your exported data and provide information on how to use it.
## File Format
All your exported files are in Markdown format. This universal format ensures compatibility with a wide range of note-taking tools and text editors.
## File Organization
Your exported data is organized as follows:
- Files are sorted by type (e.g., docs, tasks, projects, and goals)
- Documents and tasks specific to a Group are organized within their respective group folders
## Wikilinks Functionality
One of Clarity's key features is the use of Wikilinks for easy cross-referencing between notes. To continue benefiting from this functionality, we recommend using Obsidian, a free and powerful note-taking tool.
### Importing into Obsidian
1. Download and install Obsidian from [https://obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)
2. Create a new vault in Obsidian
3. Copy your exported Clarity files into the new vault folder
4. Open the vault in Obsidian

Once imported, you'll be able to navigate your notes using Wikilinks, just like in Clarity.
## Additional Information
If you have any questions about your exported data or need assistance with the import process, please don't hesitate to contact our support team at [help@clarity.so](mailto:help@clarity.so) 
We hope you continue to find value in your Clarity data, even outside of our platform. Thank you for choosing Clarity!
