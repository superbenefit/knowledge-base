## Shorter definition for Hello World post
We define Equity as:
- achieving parity in policy, process and outcomes for historically and/or currently underrepresented and/or marginalized people and groups
- the elimination of policies, practices, attitudes, and cultural messages that reinforce differential outcomes or that fail to eliminate them.
- recognizing that not everyone is starting from the same place, so creating equal results sometimes requires treating people differently from each other
- one element of justice; thus we also work to address the root causes of inequities, not just their manifestation


## Working definition (January 2022)
We understand the concept of equity in the following way:
- **Equity** refers to achieving parity in policy, process and outcomes for historically and/or currently underrepresented and/or marginalized people and groups, while accounting for diversity. Equity considers power, access, opportunities, treatment, impacts and outcomes, in three main areas:
	- Representational equity: the proportional participation at all levels of a system
	- Resource equity: the distribution of resources in order to close equity gaps; and
	- Equity-mindedness: the demonstration of an awareness of, and willingness to, address equity issues.
- Equity is one element of justice, and thus we also work to address the root causes of inequities, not just their manifestation. This includes the elimination of policies, practices, attitudes, and cultural messages that reinforce differential outcomes or that fail to eliminate them.
- Equality of treatment will not guarantee equal results; focusing on the results instead of the treatment is key to equity. Creating equal results sometimes requires treating people differently from each other, recognizing that not everyone is starting from the same place, and that deliberate measures to remove barriers to opportunities may be needed to ensure fair processes and outcomes

This is the definition from the glossary from the Community Diversity Inclusion Strategy Equity:
- The rights of the individual to an equitable share of the goods and services in society. However, equality of treatment will not guarantee equal results. Creating equal results sometimes requires treating people differently from each other. Focusing on the results instead of the treatment is the concept of equity.
(City of Toronto Task Force on Access and Equity, 2000. Diversity Our Strength, Access and Equity Our Goal: Final Report.)
	- The guarantee of fair treatment, access, opportunity, and advancement while at the same time striving to identify and eliminate barriers that have prevented the full participation of some groups. The principle of equity acknowledges that there are historically underserved and underrepresented populations, and that fairness regarding these unbalanced conditions is needed to assist equality in the provision of effective opportunities to all groups.

_From Racial Equity Tools (need broader)_
Racial equity is the condition that would be achieved if one's racial identity no longer predicted, in a statistical sense, how one fares. When we use the term, we are thinking about racial equity as one part of racial justice, and thus we also include work to address root causes of inequities, not just their manifestation. This includes elimination of policies, practices, attitudes, and cultural messages that reinforce differential outcomes by race or that fail to eliminate them.
“A mindset and method for solving problems that have endured for generations, seem intractable, harm people and communities of color most acutely, and ultimately affect people of all races. This will require seeing differently, thinking differently, and doing the work differently. Racial equity is about results that make a difference and last.”

Equity / Equitable
Equity refers to achieving parity in policy, process and outcomes for historically and/or currently underrepresented and/or marginalized people and groups while accounting for diversity. It considers power, access, opportunities, treatment, impacts and outcomes, in three main areas:

Representational equity: the proportional participation at all levels of an institution;
Resource equity: the distribution of resources in order to close equity gaps; and
Equity-mindedness: the demonstration of an awareness of, and willingness to, address equity issues.22
Context & Usage
In the university context, equity requires the creation of opportunities for historically, persistently, or systemically marginalized populations of students, staff, and faculty to have equal access to education, programs, and growth opportunities that are capable of closing achievement gaps.23, 24 This requires recognizing that not everyone is starting from the same place or history, and that deliberate measures to remove barriers to opportunities may be needed to ensure fair processes and outcomes
