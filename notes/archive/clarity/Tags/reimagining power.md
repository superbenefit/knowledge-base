The #[reimagining power](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/reimagining%20power.md) project is a collaboration between #[superbenefit](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/superbenefit.md), #[reimagine institute](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/reimagine%20institute.md), #[equality fund](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/equality%20fund.md), #[all in for sport](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/all%20in%20for%20sport.md) and the #[ontario trillium foundation](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/ontario%20trillium%20foundation.md) to explore how web3 can shift power, transform systems and shape better futures.

This project is organized by the **[Reimagining Power Group](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/group/POW)**.
# Project Purpose
- To explore how web3 can shift power, transform systems and shape better futures. In particular, how the concept of DAOs as purpose driven networks of small autonomous teams can redistribute power, value flows and resources across society at scale. 
- ## Key Stakeholders
	- #[superbenefit](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/superbenefit.md), #[ontario trillium foundation](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/ontario%20trillium%20foundation.md), #[reimagine institute](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/reimagine%20institute.md), #[equality fund](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/equality%20fund.md), #[all in for sport](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/all%20in%20for%20sport.md) 
- ## Current Goals
	- Create a playbook to answer questions specific to needs of Stakeholders:
		- What does web3 uniquely enable to shift power and transform systems?
		- What new models does web3 offer for mobilizing and distributing capital toward transformative outcomes?
		- Where might web3 provide the greatest leverage for catalyzing systemic change? 
	- Design proof of concept for partner DAO/DisCo exploration, including framework for community engagement based on Stakeholders' stated needs.
	- Publish Stories, blog posts and other media related to the project.

# Learning Journeys
- The learnings we gain from this work will be recorded here to inform the DAO and its community.
