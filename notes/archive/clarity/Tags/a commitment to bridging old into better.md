We can’t just rely on the new; we have to build a bridge to welcome the old. Let’s build that bridge to engage companies, institutions, and endowments that want to be part of this future, but who are still accountable to the old world they created. While they may be slow to change themselves, let’s give them a way to meaningfully demonstrate and contribute to the new future emerging here. What if we expanded on our soul-bound portal above but designed it for institutions? Let’s make it easy for them to commit their resources and take actions that unblock and accelerate the transition to a better future. [We are all, after all, in this together](https://discord.gg/rddG5gytNH).
