## Learn the basics
- To get started, click inside a page and start typing.
- Every time you press `Enter`, you create a new block of text.
- Type `/` to see the different kinds of blocks you can add (headings, images, checklists, and more)
- ==Select text== within a block to **add** _formatting_ and [hyperlinks](https://www.clarity.so)
- Click & drag the `â‹®â‹®` icon to the left of each block to move it around
- Indent blocks using `Tab` to create an outline. (Click the `â€º` to the left of this block to expand it)
	- Outlines can be collapsed by clicking the `â€º` to the left of each block
	- Only blocks with children (blocks indented below them) will have an `â€º` next to them
- Type `@` anywhere to mention a teammate and they'll be notified
