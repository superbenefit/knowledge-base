>The goal of this page is to introduce you to Clarity. You can edit the content below and use this page to help onboard other contributors you invite to this base.
## Welcome to your base!
A Clarity base is like a campus for your contributor community. Similar to a university campus, it's a shared space for discovery, getting work done, and earning rewards & accolades.

## Let's get familiar with each area of your base
### 🏠 Home
The community bulletin board. It's where we post important documents & links that all contributors should be able to find.
### 🧭 Roadmap
Projects & goals. The roadmap shows all the projects and objectives happening across the groups in the community. You can organize the roadmap into Milestones. Each milestone is a high-level time period (like seasons, quarters, or months). This can help establish a consistent rhythm across groups.
### 📚 Wiki
The community library. We create articles in the Wiki for important topics. Each article in the Wiki is also a `#hashtag`. When we use a hashtag in any document, the tagged content is added to the Wiki article for that topic.
### 👥 Groups
Where the work happens. Each group has its own task board, projects, and notes. A base can have many groups. You can browse, join, and leave groups from the Groups screen.
### 🔑 Roles
Permissions & abilities. A base can have many roles that decide what you are able to do. Some roles may be "self-assignable". This means you can grant them to yourself. If a role has token requirements, then you will need to have specific tokens in your connected wallet in order to grant yourself the role.
### ☀️ Connecting My Wallet
You'll need to connect an Ethereum wallet in order to access documents & roles that have token requirements, and to receive rewards for completing tasks & projects.
If you chose Sign-in with Ethereum, then your wallet is already connected to your account. If you did not choose Sign-in with Ethereum—or you want to change your connected wallet—you can manage this in My Settings. To get there, click your avatar in the top-right corner of your screen.
