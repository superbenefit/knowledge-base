Feedback is a defined term in SuperBenefit DAO's governance model. Together with role clarity and autonomy, solid feedback practices are essential to support self-management in a decentralized team.
Any Contributor may give feedback to any other Contributor who is filling a role on a project, squad or circle. Leads have an ongoing expectation to provide timely feedback to Contributors who they have filled to a role on a project, squad or circle.
The following structure for delivering constructive feedback is recommended:
- **Intent** - My intent in giving you feedback right now is... 
- **Situation** - A description of a real life situation where the behaviour was observed.
- **Behaviour** - The behaviour I noticed was...
- **Impact** - The impact on me/our work/our team was...
- **Inquiry** - "What was going on for you in that moment?" - Open, curious and empathetic

All feedback is delivered as a gift for that person with a spirit of gratitude and support, while holding the overall Purpose, Mission and Values of SuperBenefit DAO as the north star.
