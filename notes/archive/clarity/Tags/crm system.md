CRM = Community Relationship Management
## Overview
- ### Purpose
	- To maintain a record of People and Organizations that SB is connecting with and wishes to connect with, and maintain a record of covnersations that we are having with them
	- To ensure appropriate follow-up with contacts so that potential supporters and contributors don't fall through the cracks and are able to find their pathway in SB
	- To track different organizations and people we are connecting with so that SB Leads are not duplicating efforts and reaching out to the same people
- ### How to use
	- To access the CRM, please visit this [==Notion link==](https://www.notion.so/superbenefit/CRM-a023846c9ab2422eac4b80a64574ee25)

_Below is an explanation of the fields in the 3 bases:_
## People
- It is not necessary to complete all the fields. Generally you will want to add at least a name and one or more ways to to contact the person. It is also helpful (but not necessary) to add an **Affiliation** or **Note**.
- First Name
	- Can be left blank if we only know their pseudoym
- Last Name
	- This can be just an initial left blank if we don't know the last name
- Pseudonym
	- Use this if we don't have a first and last name, or if someone has a commonly used handle or pseudonym
- Discord username
- Email
- Twitter handle
- Organization & Affiliation
	- "Organization" is a broad term that includes:
		- DAOs, foundations, companies, not-for-profits, community groups, and more
	- The Organization field is ONLY used to reference an Organization that exists in (or that you would like to add to) the Organizations base. Otherwise, use Affiliation.
	- When to use Organization and when to use Affiliation?
		- Use Organization if the person's Organization is relevant to their connection to SB; in other words, if we would still be reaching out to that organization if that Person was not a contact. This could include DAOs, foundations, social impact agencies, and more. Use Affiliation if the person's organization is incidental to their connection to SB.
	- Affiliation can also be used to provide a brief "job title" or description of an individual (for example: Tiktok influencer / London community activist / prize-winning Canadian author)
- Note
	- This field is especially useful if there is no Organization or Affiliation. Use this field to note why you added the person to the CRM! Just a few words is fine. This will be useful to other SM Contributors, as well as to Future You :)
- Other fields in this base came from the original Airtable survey. We can combine or remove fields if they are no longer useful. @MBaldwin Maybe we can try using this CRM system for a week or so and then let me know your thoughts about this :)
- You can use the main body of the Page to add any notes that you like about that person

## Organizations
- Name
	- The name of the organization
- Type
	- At least option should be selected. You can select more than one. 
	- @MBaldwin Please let me know if any types need to be added
- Lead Contact
	- Which SB team member is the lead (not necessarily sole) contact for this organization?
- Website
	- Optional
- Twitter
	- Optional
- People in this Organization
	- You can click into this field to add an existing contact to the Organization, or to Create a new contact in the Organization

## Conversations
- Name
	- Write the name of the person you had the conversation with
	- This will serve as the "name" of the page/conversation in Notion
- Date
	- Select the date of the conversation. The time is not needed.
- People
	- Select the name of the person you had a conversation with. If the person is not in the database, add them.
	- This seems like it's duplicating the "Name" step above, but it's a necessary duplication

- Contacted by
	- Select your name here
- Medium
	- Select the type of interaction.
	- @MBaldwin Please let me know if these options are suitable or if they need to be tweaked
- Actions
	- a brief note of follow up action(s), if any
- You can use the main body of the page to enter meeting notes, screenshots, links, etc
