When we talk about better futures, the transformational potential of web3, and the systems we need to change, what do we really mean? Building on our [Theory of Change](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOL6uwCw=/?invite_link_id=490589173313), we’ll co-create landscapes which help: 
- Imagine and illustrate the futures we believe are possible.
- Explore the ideas and inventions that can shift trajectories towards those futures.
- Make sense of the greatest opportunities and priorities for change.
- Design how SuperBenefit develops its flywheels.

This first invitation focuses on creating a landscape for where we want to go - _‘Map 1: imagining better futures’_. This first map will also help us learn how to design and coordinate subsequent map-making rounds. [You can see the initial thinking on the work we’re preparing here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P9DdDr9bvtBkhvWKqbZ5tRUTH81U3_CIwdEPtBZcUCc/edit?usp=sharing) Let’s [get mapping, together](https://discord.gg/rddG5gytNH).
