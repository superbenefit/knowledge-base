## Purpose
To enable effective allocation of SuperBenefit resources toward high leverage activities that accelerate the SuperBenefit flywheels.
## Accountabilities
- Ensure that SuperBenfit receives high-quality proposals for activities aligned with the #[ethos](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/ethos.md)
- Enable decentralization of allocation authority in ways that increase effectiveness (over time).
- Effect continuous learning to optimize resource flows towards the highest leverage uses and accelerating the SuperBenefit flywheels (be experimental but move experimentation towards the implementation of effective strategies)
- Act in partnership with the #[discovery and sense-making squad](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/discovery%20and%20sense-making%20squad.md)  to ensure that insights and research flow effectively between the two squads
