# Context
As used here, a "primitive" is a piece of modular, composable organizational tooling which can be configured in combination with other such tooling to serve a wide variety of use cases for various types of organization.
The concept we call "**[[notes/archive/clarity/Tags/dao primitives]]"** relates to a prevailing design philosophy in web3 toward the development and use of such tooling, and was not created by a specific person or group. The topic can be vast and somewhat technical, so we describe this trend here as #[[notes/archive/clarity/Tags/dao primitives]] to keep things simple. 
- ## Concepts
	- This rundown is primarily based on the **[Modular Politics Framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1FvWQ3WEAE)**. See #[[P-290 Patterns & Modules - DAO Primitives]] for more information.
	- ### High-Level System Entities
		- **Platform - **The underlying computational infrastructure used for communication and coordination.
		- **Instance** - A specific implementation of digital governance ("Modular Politics"), however implemented.
		- **Organization** - The local (centralized or distributed) computational environment in which people interact.
	- ### Artifacts (Operational Entities)
		- Objects and actions which can be affected by causative agents
		- Also includes those causative agents such as users and bots
		- Examples: Constitution, DAO State, docs, treasury assets, badges, tokens, most other "things".
	- ### Design Pattern
		- A combination of design references, templates, tools and configuration opinions which serve a highly specific use case for a particular cohort of users. (Typically not generalizable across a wide range of use cases.)
		- #[[Partnership Governance - Reimagining Power]]
	- ### Modules
		- Configurable software packages which modify the functionality of processes and programs (both socialware _and_ trustware) within the organization.
		- A module's editable configuration options are "**Policies**". The current active configuration option is the "**State**".
		- examples: Snapshot X, Safe, Moloch Shamans GR-312 Web3 Stakeholder Modules - DAO Primitives
		- ### Monitors
			- Discriminative, "read-only" software modules which provide feedback by evaluating specific conditions according to known criteria.
			- Examples: Praise Bot, Snapshot, Sourcecred, Oracles, etc.

# DAO Primitives Team
- The [DAO Primitives team](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/group/GR) is a workgroup at #[[superbenefit]] focused on research and sensemaking around web3 tooling and practices.
- ## Contributions to SuperBenefit
	- The team provides facilitation, solutions engineering and operational support to #[[superbenefit]], its cells and its DAO-wide projects (such as the #[[G-269 SuperBenefit Playbooks]]). 
	- ### Contribution to SB Goals
		- ⬜️ SUP-272 Revolution 2 Update
		- ⬜️ SUP-269 SuperBenefit Playbooks
	- ### DAO - to - DAO Partnerships
		- In addition to its contributions to #[[superbenefit]], the [DAO Primitives team](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/group/GR) also contributes to All In For Sport, acting as governance facilitators and solutions engineers.
