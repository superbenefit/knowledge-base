**Purpose:** to make sure that learnings from the previous Revolution are captured and that we hold space for those learnings to inform our plans for the next Revolution.
This process is to be carried out asynchronously using the [SuperBenefit Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_llbEduw=/) by all members of the General Circle. See the "Reflection" section on the top-right corner of [this Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_llbEduw=/).
## Process
1. Each member of the General Circle spends 15 minutes adding sticky notes to each of the 4 quadrants of the 4 L's Matrix on the Miro Board. Please see the definitions below for what each of the 4 L's refers to.
	- If a sticky that someone else wrote particularly resonates with you, add an emoji to it to signal your agreement (or otherwise)
2. The Information Squad collects the responses and looks for patterns
3. The General Circle discusses how the learnings can inform the next Revolution

## Defining the 4 L's
### Liked
- What did the team really enjoy about the previous Revolution? This could be anything from a process, an achievement, a particular team action or even a technology. In particular, what went better than expected? Emphasize the positive elements of an otherwise difficult sprint.

### Learned
- What things did the team learn from experiments, testing, conversation and from working with each other during the last Revolution? These could be technical or non-technical things and could include any new discoveries, points of interest or highlights.

### Lacked
- What seemed to be missing from the last Revolution? This might be something that was unclear or needed to be implemented to ensure that things continue to run smoothly.

### Longed For
- What support did the team desire during the last Revolution? What is something that you wish existed or was possible that would ensure that the project would be successful?
