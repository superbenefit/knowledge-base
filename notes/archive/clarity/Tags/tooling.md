## SuperBenefit Tool Stack
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/5WsmHHA2Mh) - This is the most important for day-to-day communication. It's the first point of entry into the community for most newcomers to SB and it's where most conversations are taking place.
- Clarity - This is a workspace, notetaking and wiki tool that we use to share internal documents and work on documents before making them public. Full access to Clarity is limited to SB Leads; Contributors may be granted comment-only access to Clarity and access to edit individual pages as needed. Some pages may be made visible publicly (for example, pages related to Governance)
- [Notion](https://superbenefit.notion.site/superbenefit/SuperBenefit-Community-7842086e42064061b7d48709c151c93c) - This is our public Community Resources site where we share information about SuperBenefit and its current activities and needs. It's a place for community members to learn more about SB and to find out how to get involved with a guild, project or bounty.
- [MIRO](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_llbEduw=/?invite_link_id=576108043185) - This is where we work through our ideas in a visually oriented collaborative workspace that allows flow charts, diagrams, sticky notes and more visual tools. There may be different Miro boards set up by different team members at different times to assist with planning different projects.

## Clarity basics
- To get started, click inside a page and start typing.
- Every time you press `Enter`, you create a new block of text.
- Type `/` to see the different kinds of blocks you can add (headings, images, checklists, and more)
- ==Select text== within a block to add formatting and hyperlinks
- Click & drag the `â‹®â‹®` icon to the left of each block to move it around
- Indent blocks using `Tab` to create an outline.
	- Outlines can be collapsed by clicking the `â€º` to the left of each block.
	- Indentation is important not just for aesthetics but for organising and structuring information.
	- Only blocks with children (blocks indented below them) will have an `â€º` next to them
- Type `@` anywhere to mention a teammate and they'll be notified.
- Highlight a block and tap the `speech bubble` to leave a comment. You can use `@` to mention colleagues in comments.  The inbox at the top of the sidebar will let you see all comments where you are mentioned.

## Clarity tips and tricks
- **Tagging** - when you are writing and want to reference a tag (or create a new one) simply type `#` and it will help you. If you go back and select text and tap on the tag feature, it will create a new tag from the selected text (this will create a duplicate tag of the same name if it already exists).
- You can also use **markdown** for inline formatting as you go. 
- You can `shift + click` on an internal link to open it in Split View
- Use `Cmd + 0` to toggle the sidebar
- Use `/` to quickly turn some text into a task (or into a different type of block)
- The [Clarity User Manual](https://app.clarity.so/wiki/pages/e1bdb0ed-065b-458d-a666-ba1672e2fcdb) includes lots more useful information. It's well worth a read! Ask @Lewwwk or @heenal if you're not sure about something.
- You can also Contact Clarity Support (use the `?` link in the top right) with any questions and usually receive a prompt response

## Using Clarity for SuperBenefit
### Roadmap & Project Structure
- All Projects are part of the **Roadmap** (see link in sidebar)
- SuperBenefit's work is organized into Revolutions (equivalent to Seasons in other DAOs):
	- #[revolution 0- foundations](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/revolution%200-%20foundations.md) 
	- #[revolution 1- genesis](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/revolution%201-%20genesis.md) 
- **Initiatives** in Clarity correspond to the Interventions outlined in SuperBenefit's [first Mirror post](https://mirror.xyz/superbenefit.eth/8Icbwygio4EJfEvh8we9Xz4IcZxzWfjyzmlMGXlxxjc):
	- #[Intervention 1- Mapping pathways to the future](Intervention%201-%20Mapping%20pathways%20to%20the%20future) 
	- #[Intervention 2- Building Capacity and Interdependence Through Governance](Intervention%202-%20Building%20Capacity%20and%20Interdependence%20Through%20Governance) 
	- #[Intervention 3- Creating a Soul-Bound Portal to a Better Future](Intervention%203-%20Creating%20a%20Soul-Bound%20Portal%20to%20a%20Better%20Future) 
	- #[[Intervention 4- A Metacurrency for Metagovernance, Values and Acceleration
]]
	- #[[Intervention 5- A Commitment to Bridging Old Into Better
]]
	- #[[Intervention 6- The Look, Feel, and Story of a Better Future.
]]
- Each Initiative will contain one or more **Projects**, corresponding to a defined, time-bound piece of work with specific deliverables
- Each Project contains **Tasks**. Tasks can also have **Sub-tasks**.

### Sidebar
- Pinned Pages:
	- ** Home** - Includes links to Governance overview, processes and proposals.
	- You can access links to all Squad pages by either the **Home** or **General Circle** links in the sidebar.
	- **Tooling** - this document
	- **Templates **- Templates that you can copy for Tactical Meetings, Bounties, and more to come
- Sidebar links
	- **Assigned to me** - Quickly see open tasks assigned to you
	- **Wiki** - See all SuperBenefit pages, listed alphabetically
	- **Roadmap** - The highest level overview of SuperBenefit. Underneath the Roadmap are Initiatives, underneath the  initiatives are Projects, and underneath Projects are Tasks.
- Updating Statues & Due Dates
	- Some tasks are showing as incomplete which have been completed; other tasks are showing due dates days or weeks in the past. Tidying up these task statuses and due dates will help us to surface the tasks that are actually overdue and which need attention. You can use the "Assigned to me" view to easily see all the tasks assigned to you and the pinned "Open Tasks by Project" view to see tasks in projects you own that may be assigned to other people (or to nobody).
