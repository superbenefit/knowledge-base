# The Purpose of this Guide 
- The Purpose of this Guide is to support the mission and work of SuperBenefit and to enable the mission to move faster.
- The Contributor Guide will provide clarity to the SuperBenefit community about the opportunities available to take up existing bounties that interest them or to make proposals they think are aligned with the #[ethos](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/ethos.md) and #[interventions](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/interventions.md).
- Broadening the range of contributors to SuperBenefit will allow for the distribution of $SPRB to more individuals in an open and transparent fashion, and will make SuperBenefit more resilient and diverse.
- This guide will outline the systems of organization that characterize SuperBenefit, helping you to understand how and where your impact will be greatest. 

# SuperBenefit's Purpose 
- We’re running out of time. We need to make better faster. SuperBenefit exists to embed universal abundance into our deepest  systems, and to accelerate the arrival of a better future. 
- The combination of emerging technologies and practices holds the promise for a new set of societal systems, infrastructure, and institutions. As a [socio-technical transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions#Socio-technical_systems_and_transitions), they present the opportunity to flip our civilization onto a new path, abandoning the limitations of our old paradigm for new ones fit for the complexity of the world we live in today. 
- There is much to do, and we’re ready. Find out how you can get involved and contribute to [six unique interventions](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/8Icbwygio4EJfEvh8we9Xz4IcZxzWfjyzmlMGXlxxjc).
- ## Purpose
	- SuperBenefit’s purpose is to embed universal abundance into the core infrastructure of the future.
- ## Mission
	- To develop the social and financial flywheels that enable invention, investment, and acceleration of a better world.
- ## Values
	- Believe in better
	- Act into being
	- Explore and experiment
	- Seek leverage
	- Learn and scale
	- Together, for all, for generations to come

- ## **Theory of Change**
	- SuperBenefit's [Theory of change](https://www.notion.so/superbenefit/SuperBenefit-s-Theory-of-Change-082185032e744923977928b06f46ec1f), expounded in [our first Mirror post](https://app.clarity.so/), is a logical hypothesis that connects the elements that contribute to creating an intentional change.
	- To help build understanding, we've developed **[four different "angles"](https://www.notion.so/superbenefit/SuperBenefit-s-Theory-of-Change-082185032e744923977928b06f46ec1f) **- alternative ways of expressing the theory of change and components within it.[

# Expectations 
- Artists, information and communication designers, developers, governance pros, process experts, systems designers, defi architects and engineers, facilitators, sense-makers, storytellers – are all welcome in SuperBenefit.
- Working in the DAO/web3 space is likely to be (and feel) different from work in other organizations. This stems from both the use of emergent technology and the development of new norms and practices. Here are a few navigating principles that can help guide contributions at SuperBenefit.

	- If you're choosing to be part of SuperBenefit, you're choosing to be part of an experiment with a direction - a better future.
	- There's lots of unknowns and new relationships to navigate. Humility is our friend in this wilderness.
	- To get anywhere, we'll need to move quickly - this will require probing what might be, seeing how ideas play out, and then changing and adapting as we go. So, we'll need to hold everything lightly.
	- Nothing is permanent. Let's aim for what's good for now, as long as we avoid any unhelpful path dependencies.
	- We rely on people being proactive. If you see a need, call it out and act on it.
	- Inquiry is orientation. How might we? How could we? Why would we? How will we?
	- _It's like a finger pointing away to the moon. Don't concentrate on the finger or you will miss all that heavenly glory.'_ Despite all the bells and whistles, let's stay concentrated on the big idea and real-world transformation.


# Organization & Structure 
- It's important to understand how SuperBenefit is structured. See our [Governance Model](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/pages/e76ce5c4-ffbd-4206-97d9-f2de91e761ed) to get a picture of the structure and how decisions are made.
- Having a mental model of the organization, how it works, where things are located, and the kinds of roles involved not only makes it easier to get involved, it also makes people better contributors. Reading the next sections, try to keep that in mind and form a mental model of SuperBenefit and how you might fit into the system.

# The Work 
- ## Six Interventions
- SuperBenefit is stewarding impact at the macro scale by developing a series of outputs. These outputs are framed as six interventions for contribution.
	1. Mapping pathways to the future
	2.  Building capacity and interdependence through governance
	3. Creating a soul-bound portal to a better future
	4. A metacurrency for metagovernance, values, and acceleration
	5. A commitment to bridging old into better
	6. The look, feel, and story of a better future.
	7. Visual Representation of the Interventions
- Projects are initiated through Proposals, in order to further progress on one or more Intervention Areas.
- ## How to get involved with current projects:
	- [Check out the Discord](https://discord.gg/QFW7Wc7cgS) - #helpwanted channel and #announcements 
	- Check out the "Active Projects" section of the [Community Resources site](https://www.notion.so/superbenefit/SuperBenefit-Community-7842086e42064061b7d48709c151c93c) to see if there are any projects that resonate with you
	- Reach out to @MBaldwin or @heenal from the Community Experience team for some ideas 

# The Timeline 
- ## Revolutions
- Work at SuperBenefit is organized into Revolutions. Revolutions are like seasons, creating a temporal structure for project timelines.
- ## Why "Revolutions"? 
- It connects to circles, flywheels, evolutions and the desire for revolutionary change.
- ## When
- Revolution 0 (Rev 0), which ran from October 2021 to February 2022, centred around understanding the context and aims of coming together through SuperBenefit. We established our theory of change, identified key interventions, and established our core governance primitives and treasury. 
- Revolution1 (Rev 1), which commenced in March 2022 and is currently underway, is centred around tempo and taking action in relation to the identified intervention areas and is meant to take us to a minimally viable and sustainable state. How we get there is up to those who show up.

# Tool Stack
- The way tools are used plays an important role in maintaining the coherence of the contributor community. Structure helps people have the freedom to get the important work done.
- Below is an outline of the main tools that we use and how we use them, understanding that there may be some variations between different projects at different times.
- ## Communication (internal)
	- ### **[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/rddG5gytNH ) **
		- Discord is the hub of communications. This is not only the first point of entry into the community for most newcomers to SuperBenefit and the site of day-to-day conversations, but also the site of knowledge capture.
		- It's best practice to use Discord for all relevant communication activities, avoiding the dispersal of conversations to email and other locations. Use the appropriate project channels, use threads where needed, and avoid DMs or group DMs for all but the most exceptional circumstances.
			- Information is transformed into knowledge through conversation and shared analysis
			- This knowledge is recorded and formalized in **Clarity**
			- If you're new to Discord, you might find this handy [Discord Guide](https://www.discordguide.xyz/) to be a helpful resource
	- ### **[****](https://twitter.com/SuperBenefitDAO )**[Clarity](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/home)****
		- Clarity is a hub of knowledge - it is our tool to plan projects, track tasks and a collaborative workspace/wiki. Not only are documents drafted here, but this is also a site of connection, making links between relevant documents. It's the site where lore and expert knowledge is built. Its value grows over time as more information is added and more links are created. 
			- [Guide to SuperBenefit's Clarity system](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/pages/a16db16f-ee23-4ae9-9d39-c86a0a1d89a5)
			- [Clarity User Manual](https://app.clarity.so/wiki/pages/e1bdb0ed-065b-458d-a666-ba1672e2fcdb)
- ## Communication (External)
	- External communications give people a hint of the internal knowledge. The best approach is to peek inside the workings of the DAO, pulling things that will grab interest and drive further investigation.
	- ### [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/SuperBenefitDAO )** **
		- View Twitter as a space to pulling memes and tidbits from the discord (plus announcements). It should be fun and inviting, a space to connect with likeminded humans and build relationships.
		- The tone across web3 Twitter is overwhelmingly informal. It’s casual, it’s friendly, it reflects the ethos that we’re all explorers together.
		- [See here for the full Twitter Style Guide.](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/notes/0e80b649-d098-43c9-8b0c-bf84b551c1ae)
	- ### **[Mirror](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz) **
		- Long form writing, publishing formally realized insights from the community.
	- ### **[Website](https://www.superbenefit.org/ )**
		- The website is largely for routing people to information, communications channels, working areas, etc. Currently this happens by routing people to Discord.
	- ### **[Notion](https://www.notion.so/superbenefit/SuperBenefit-Community-7842086e42064061b7d48709c151c93c)**
		- Notion is the home of SuperBenefit's **Community Resources site**.
		- This is intended to be a one-stop resource hub for new and prospective contributors, including:
			- an introduction/overview to SuperBenefit
			- a list of active projects and how to get involved
			- latest news and links
			- resources for both newcomers to web3 and more seasoned travelers
- ## **Whiteboard / Design**
	- Sometimes its important to sort through information in a collaborative, visual environment. White-boarding tools enable this.
	- ### **Miro **
		- Project leads and/or Contributors set up Miro boards on their personal accounts on a case-by-case basis and share them with applicable contributors as needed..
		- Best practice is to embed Miro boards back into clarity so that knowledge doesn't get lost.
	- ### **Figma**
		- The preference is now to Figma instead of Miro, because Figma's free plan allows more full users (users with edit privileges) compared to Miro
		- The Governance Research Project Miro board has been moves from Miro to Figma. This may not be a necessary course of action for all past/current projects, but all new projects should use Figma, in preference to Miro.
- ## **Treasury**
	- ### [**Gnosis Safe**](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/)
		- Gnosis Safe is used to disburse tokens from multi-sig wallets to individual contributors, based on approved Proposals
	- ### **[Coordinape](https://app.coordinape.com/circles/1655/history)**
		- Coordinape is used, as needed, to allocate tokens for a project and/or based on a peer-to-peer review process
- ## **Governance**
	- ### **[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/superbenefit.eth-) **
		- Snapshot is the voting framework that allows SuperBenefit and other DAOs to run our governance on-chain on layer 2 and execute transactions on Ethereum in a fully trustless way.

# Community 
- ## **Lore **
	- Organization happens at the level of conversations. Lore is the linguistic landscape of aesthetics, narratives, patterns, and instructions which characterize network of individuals.  In other words, lore is the substance of effective communications. It is the connective tissue of people working towards common goals. 
	- Lore will play a critical in role in coordinating SuperBenifit contributors. However, lore is emergent. It can't be synthetically created. It happens on its own terms. The challenge SuperBenifit faces, as it grows, is to carve out space, celebrate, and elevate lore within the tool stacks and operational practices. 
	- This requires a playful attentiveness to:
		- narratives: stories, often from a personal perspective about important moments or distinctions (intros in Discord, Mirror articles, meeting notes in Clarity)
		- memes: aesthetic expressions of the distinct expert knowledge (to come)
		- history: the chronology of the organization. - ORIGIN STORY @ayusha01 
		- information architecture and categories
		- lexicons (specific to SuperBenefit)
		- roles and their histories of practice
		- the language of decision making
- ## **Rituals  **
	- Rituals are the shared activity that bridge decentralization and bring us together. 
	- **Welcoming new members** - sending a note to welcome them in addition to the bot message.
	- **GM channel** - adding an emoji when someone shares GM in the channel acknowledges their presence in discord. This started off from the community experience team and now others are carrying this forward.
	- **Weekly Update - **a round up of important project, community, resource updates are posted to the #announcement channel weekly to keep the community informed.
	- **Coffee Chats - **a casual meet up of those new to SuperBenefit and those who have been part of it to connect, learn more about SuperBenefit and create community.
	- **Share Contributions - **post writing and contributions to the web3 space by SuperBenefit members in Discord and other DAOs where appropriate to amplify their work.

# Decision Making & Resource Allocation 
- See our [Governance Model](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/pages/e76ce5c4-ffbd-4206-97d9-f2de91e761ed) to get a picture of SuperBenefit's governance structure and how decisions are made.

	- There are also additional Operational Wallets (funded out of Polygon wallet) allocated to projects or other areas of activity, as determined by Proposals.

# Contribution Recognition 
- ## There are 3 main ways that Contributors to SuperBenefit have contributions recognized:
	- Proposals are passed to disburse tokens from multi-sig wallets to individual Contributors
	- Circles or Projects use their internal decision-making processes to disburse tokens that have been allocated to them. This may include using Coordinape or another peer-to-peer decision-making process.
	- Contributors claim Bounties which, once completed and reviewed, trigger the disbursement of tokens to the Contributor
- ## Bounties:
	- Bounties are rewards given to people who complete tasks that help further SuperBenefit's Purpose. Bounties are the way work in the Web3 world gets done. They allow anybody to take initiative and make the project they’re passionate about better. 
	- Once the person noted in the bounty proposal as the bounty reviewer has reviewed the Bounty, the Bounty will be disbursed by the project lead or by #Treasury within 7 days. 
	- Creating a Bounty
		- Any Circle has the authority to create Bounties using its allocated tokens
		- Any $SPRB holder may propose the creation of a Bounty by following the Proposal process
		- A template for Bounties can be found in #[drafts/sb-clarity/Tags/templates](drafts/sb-clarity/Tags/templates) 
	- ### **Where to find Bounties:**
		- A formal Bounty Board is currently under development. In the mean time, this is how to get involved with current projects:
