## Design Principles
- Minimum viable governance, only as much as we need
- Attracts energy, skills and contributions
- Creates clarity of action and forward momentum
- Rewards Contributors for their efforts
- Respects the autonomy of Contributors working to advance SuperBenefit's Purpose
- Key decisions and actions are documented and transparent to all

[[$sprb]]
- SuperBenefit rewards the work of Contributors with tokens, including the $SPRB token which is used in the DAO's governance.
- Contributors use $SPRB to vote on major strategic decisions of SuperBenefit DAO.

#[[proposals]] 
- Proposals are the primary means by which decisions are made which affect SuperBenefit's #[[ethos]] or the deployment of SuperBenefit's #[[notes/archive/clarity/Tags/treasury]].
- Any $SPRB holder may make a Proposal by following this process:
	- Share a draft of the Proposal in the #proposal-ideas or #proposal-development channels in Discord. The preference is to reach a fist-to-five soft consensus, so that any major revisions can happen in conversation before the Proposal goes to Snapshot.
	- Once a proposal is developed, it is turned into a task in Clarity and the General Circle facilitates a voting process via Snapshot for a duration of no less than 48 hours
	- Following the voting period, the results of the Proposal will be recorded, publicized and executed promptly
- Individual Circles (including the General Circle) may determine their own processes for making, voting on, recording and executing Proposals pertaining to that Circle's Purpose and Accountabilities

[[general circle]] 
- The General Circle is the originator of the core Circles of SuperBenefit and is accountable for setting and resourcing strategic direction
- The members of the General Circle are the General Circle Lead and all Circle Leads.
- Any $SPRB holder may propose changes to the Purpose and Accountabilities of the General Circle by making a Proposal. Such a Proposal requires a super-majority (66.67%) to pass.
- Any $SPRB holder may make a Proposal to remove a Circle Lead from their role.

General Circle Lead
- The General Circle Lead guides the General Circle to collectively steer SuperBenefit towards its Purpose (see #[[ethos]]).
- The General Circle Lead is accountable to holders of $SPRB, who have the authority to change who fills the General Circle Lead role through the Proposal process.

 Circles (or Cells)
- SuperBenefit's work is organized into Circles, which may be created by the passing of a Proposal outlining the proposed Circle's Purpose and Accountabilities. The Purpose may include overseeing a domain or pursuing a specific objective.
- A Circle may be permanent or temporary. The Circle from which it emerged may remove a Circle when it is no longer needed.
- Each Circle has a Lead, who is invited into the role by the Circle it is accountable to

Circle Lead
- The Circle Lead helps the Circle move forward by setting priorities, creating roles, and inviting Contributors into work. 
- Membership of the Circle is determined by the Circle Lead. Circle Leads have the ability to remove individual Members from that Circle if they are keeping it from moving forward.
