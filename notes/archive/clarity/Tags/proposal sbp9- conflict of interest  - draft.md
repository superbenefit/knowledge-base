# Background
Conflicts are inevitable and necessary, in fact, if there is no conflict it might be that a complacent culture is unfolding in a DAO. There are instances where conflicts are not aligned with the ethos and values. 
@rathermercurial.eth who has contributed to SuperBenefit in addition to other DAOs posted a tweet that prompted a discussion about researching a Conflict of Interest guide/process/policy for the SuperBenefit community and that would be relevant and accessible to other DAOS. A conflict of interest discussion should be part of a DAO and governance framework. In keeping with SuperBenefit's primitive or minimum viable approach, this should be a tightly crafted approach that will be accessible and flexible and yet direct and built on equitable and accountable principles.

**Note**: This proposal follows the **Purpose | Design | Momentum** format that we have been experimenting with for the DAO primitive concept. 
# Proposal
## Purpose
To research and draft a Conflict of Interest process or policy with an input process SuperBenefit and could be adapted by other DAOs. The COI process and/or policy should include what is considered a conflict, a conflict resolution process and accountability mechanisms.
 In keeping with SuperBenefit's primitive or minimum viable approach, this should be a tightly crafted approach that will be accessible and flexible and yet direct and built on equitable and accountable principles.
## Design
Research Phase - research existing frameworks, policy, process and research related to DAOs. Identify gaps and nuances specific to DAOs.
Input Phase - host a discussion about conflict with SuperBenefit community.
Drafting of Process/Policy Phase - based on research and input from conflict of interest discussion draft a process/policy. 
Distribution Phase - share draft with SuperBenefit community and other DAOs for comment, edits and input. Update process/policy and share version 1 with SuperBenefit community for implementation. Share version 1 with other DAOs for adaptation. 
Review Phase - create a timeline for further discussions and updates to Conflict of Interest process/policy. 
## Momentum
There have been significant Conflicts of Interest in DAOs that have been serious occurrences with inaction by DAOs due to lack of clarity on process and accountability. Often these processes and policies are created in reaction to a serious occurrence. Given the learning and examples to date, SuperBenefit can consider Conflict of Interest as a necessary governance infrastructure for its purpose and for DAOs more broadly.

## Details:
The skills and experience required for this project will include research, project management, writing, communications, equity lens and community engagement/convening.
