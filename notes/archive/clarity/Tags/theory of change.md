## What is a Theory of Change?
- A theory of change (or impact map) is a logical hypothesis that connects the elements that contribute to creating an intentional change – it includes:
	- How we frame a challenge/opportunity.
	- What we (will) do.
	- How we (will) do it.
	- The results we expect those activities to generate.
	- The eventual change we are aiming to contribute to.
- It also:
	- Helps develop a common understanding of what an organization or intervention is trying to change and how.
	- Strengthens the focus of interventions.
	- Drives the development of strategies and workstreams.
	- Provides a framework for tracking and assessing performance.
	- Enables the identification of complementary partners.
	- Supports thinking and conversations around change.
	- Surfaces and makes assumptions explicit.

We’ve developed **four different “angles”** – alternative ways of expressing the Theory of Change, and components within it. [See the Miro Board for the latest versions of all these angles.](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOL6uwCw=/)
## Angle 1: the narrative logic

## Angle 2: A focus on outcomes

## Angle 3: A focus on the “flywheels”

## Angle 4: Another metaphor - SuperBenefit as a mycelium network for invention and transformation
