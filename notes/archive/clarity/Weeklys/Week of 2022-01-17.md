## Triage Items
What tensions do you have that need resolution to move forward in your work?
- I didn't have enough context to comment of the $SPRB token feedback (Rowan)
	- @Rowan  would it be help to setup a call on this specifcally or is there some more context you could use in #[[$sprb]]
	- I too felt that I don't know enough about other structures and felt that important to the transparency but trusted that you were holding values of SB
	- âœ… SUP-115 SPRB Design Conversation
- Discord video performance is often very bad. Can we fix it with boosts or should we switch to Zoom (at least for the welcome parties)? - boosted to next level, so will re-visit next week 
- Can the Community Experience Squad get access to edit the verify message in Discord?
- Current community members want to get involved and we need guilds sorted to be able to engage people, recognize this is in process.
	- Challenge of people expecting that they can help and us not having appropriate places for them to jump in. This will change as SB develops and has more projects on the go
	- We could share a "low skill" project in the help-wanted channel as an easy way for people t get involved
	- Even better:@MBaldwin Develop micro-bounty ideas
