## Discussion topics
- Menzies Foundation - Michelle to write up a note and proposal  - check in on focus and idea
	- Idea - onboarding infrastructure could be funded by Menzies Foundation?
		- what does it take to onboard someone into web3? design it up, put together some resources.
			- salons could be part of onboarding
		- make it available as a public good and also would be part of the playbook
- Funding for SB via projects (Rowan)
	- SB needs to develop infrastructure + also plays a coordinating role. There is work to do but no funding.
	- Maybe projects could spin back a percentage of funds received to SB
		- For RPP & WREEP, cells can decide ad hoc to allocate some funds back to the parent
		- Moving forwards, we can include this in the cell setup

# Decisions 
- We agreed that individual cells can choose to allocate some of their funding back to SuperBenefit. Then we will do a more thorough design on how to do this when we do the bigger re org on SB governance/opps
