 Web3 Discovery Process: Facilitator's Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the three resources in this folder to conduct an effective web3 discovery process with organizations. The discovery process focuses on mapping current systems and identifying systemic issues as a foundation for exploring web3 technologies and decentralized governance approaches.

## Resources in This Folder

1. **[Web3 Discovery Process Workflow](web3-discovery-process-workflow.md)** - A step-by-step process for conducting discovery
2. **[Web3 Discovery Report Template](web3-discovery-report-template.md)** - The document structure for capturing findings
3. **[Web3 Discovery Report Guide](web3-discovery-report-guide.md)** - Guidance on completing each section of the report

## How These Resources Work Together

These documents are designed to be used in sequence:

1. **First, understand the process** outlined in the Workflow document
2. **Then, familiarize yourself with the output** by reviewing the Template and Guide
3. **Finally, execute the process** following the Workflow and capture findings using the Template

## Practical Implementation Guide

### Before You Begin

1. **Understand the Purpose**
   - Review all three documents to understand the full discovery process
   - Clarify your objectives for the specific organization you're working with
   - Identify who needs to be involved from both facilitation and stakeholder sides

2. **Customize Your Approach**
   - Consider the organization's context, size, and familiarity with web3 concepts
   - Adjust the scope and depth of the process accordingly
   - Prepare explanatory materials tailored to participants' knowledge levels

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. Preparation Phase

**Using the Workflow Document:**
- Follow the guidance in "Phase 1: Preparation" to identify stakeholders
- Use the stakeholder identification section to ensure diverse perspectives
- Prepare collaborative tools as suggested (whiteboarding tools, templates)

**Tips for Success:**
- Schedule individual pre-conversations with key stakeholders to build understanding
- Create a simple explanation of the discovery process to share in advance
- Prepare visual templates aligned with the System Mapping section of the report

#### 2. System Mapping Workshops

**Using the Workflow Document:**
- Implement "Phase 2: System Mapping Workshop" as your primary guide
- Structure workshop activities around creating the maps described

**Using the Report Template/Guide:**
- Review the "Current System Mapping" section to understand what you need to capture
- Use the subsections (Organizational Structure, Core Processes, etc.) to structure your mapping activities

**Tips for Success:**
- Allocate sufficient time (typically 2-3 hours) for thorough system mapping
- Document maps visually during the session (photos, digital captures)
- Check for agreement on system maps before concluding

#### 3. Systemic Issues Identification

**Using the Workflow Document:**
- Follow "Phase 3: Systemic Issues Identification" to structure this exploration
- Use the pattern recognition, systems analysis, and power dynamics review steps

**Using the Report Template/Guide:**
- Reference the "Systemic Issues Identified" section to focus your investigation
- Use the categories (Structural Challenges, Process Inefficiencies, etc.) to organize findings

**Tips for Success:**
- Ask "why" questions repeatedly to get to root causes
- Capture both explicit and implicit issues that emerge
- Look for patterns across different parts of the system

#### 4. Areas of Interest Exploration

**Using the Workflow Document:**
- Implement "Phase 4: Areas of Interest Exploration" to connect issues to web3 approaches
- Follow the collaborative exploration and web3 pattern connection steps

**Using the Report Template/Guide:**
- Reference the "Areas of Interest" and "Connections to Web3 Patterns" sections
- Structure discussions around the questions format provided in the template

**Tips for Success:**
- Introduce web3 patterns gradually, relating them to identified issues
- Use "How might we..." framing to keep the exploration open and generative
- Document questions and areas of energy/interest as they emerge

#### 5. Synthesis and Report Creation

**Using the Workflow Document:**
- Follow "Phase 5: Synthesis & Report Creation" to compile insights
- Use the synthesize findings and create discovery report steps

**Using the Report Template/Guide:**
- Use the template as your document structure
- Reference the guide for detailed instructions on completing each section

**Tips for Success:**
- Draft the report soon after workshops while insights are fresh
- Include visual elements from the mapping sessions
- Review the draft with key stakeholders before finalizing

### Common Challenges and Solutions

#### Challenge: Limited Stakeholder Participation

**Solution:**
- Conduct individual interviews to supplement workshop participation
- Use asynchronous methods (surveys, shared documents) to gather perspectives
- Consider a phased approach with multiple smaller sessions

#### Challenge: Technical Knowledge Gaps

**Solution:**
- Provide pre-reading materials appropriate to participants' knowledge levels
- Include a glossary of terms in workshop materials
- Use analogies to familiar systems when introducing web3 concepts

#### Challenge: Resistance to Systems Analysis

**Solution:**
- Frame the process as collaborative exploration rather than critique
- Focus on future possibilities rather than current problems
- Acknowledge constraints and legitimate concerns that shape current systems

#### Challenge: Maintaining Focus on Discovery vs. Solutions

**Solution:**
- Clearly distinguish discovery from implementation phases
- Capture solution ideas that emerge but redirect focus to understanding
- Use parking lots for implementation ideas that arise prematurely

### Adapting for Different Contexts

#### For Organizations New to Web3

- Extend the preparation phase with educational components
- Focus more on connecting to familiar challenges before introducing web3 concepts
- Emphasize learning opportunities in the report

#### For Organizations with Web3 Experience

- Dive deeper into technical aspects of system mapping
- Connect to specific web3 protocols and implementations
- Include more technical considerations in the report

#### For Time-Constrained Processes

- Consider a condensed approach combining mapping and issues identification
- Focus on fewer, high-priority areas of the system
- Scale back the scope of the report while maintaining core sections

## After the Discovery Process

The discovery report serves as a foundation for next steps, which might include:

1. **Experiment Scoping** - Defining specific interventions to test based on discovery insights
2. **Learning Journeys** - Connecting the organization with relevant communities and resources
3. **Prototype Development** - Creating small-scale implementations of promising approaches

The discovery process is successful when it produces:
- A shared understanding of the current system
- Clear identification of systemic issues
- Documented areas of interest for potential web3 approaches
- A foundation for informed next steps

## Additional Resources

- Collaborative mapping tools: Figjam, Miro, MURAL
- Facilitation techniques: World Caf√©, Liberating Structures, Journey Mapping
- System thinking resources: Donella Meadows' "Thinking in Systems," Cynefin Framework

Remember that discovery is an iterative process - it's perfectly normal to revisit earlier phases as new insights emerge. The workflow, template, and guide provided here are flexible resources designed to support your facilitation, not rigid prescriptions to follow.
