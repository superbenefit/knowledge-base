# Prompt for Phase 2 - Link Normalization Project

## Project Context

I need to continue with **Phase 2** of the link normalization project for my SuperBenefit Knowledge Base vault. Phase 1 has been completed.

**Project Plan Location**: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\link-fix\link-normalization-plan-v2.md`

**Phase 1 Summary**: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\link-fix\06-phase-1-summary.md`

## Current Status

- **Vault**: F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base (on `plugin-test` branch)
- **Phase 1**: âœ… COMPLETE
  - Obsidian Links plugin installed and configured
  - 28 files with 307 leading slash links identified
  - T03-Remove-Leading-Slashes template tested and working
  - All templates stored in `/tools/templates/link-fix-templates/`

## Phase 2 Objective

Begin Phase 2: Conversion Strategy and Planning (as defined in the plan)

## Working Style Requirements

Please follow these important working principles learned from Phase 1:

1. **Step-by-step execution**: Work through each step methodically. Don't skip ahead or create multiple deliverables at once.

2. **Human approval**: Always wait for human input before proceeding to the next step. Don't assume approval.

3. **No file editing without permission**: Never edit vault files directly. Create templates and scripts for the human to execute.

4. **Use Templater**: All scripts should be Templater templates, not standalone JavaScript files.

5. **Clear communication**: Explain what needs to be done and wait for confirmation before creating artifacts or templates.

6. **Sequential numbering**: Continue the established pattern (08-, 09-, etc.) for new files in `/link-fix/`
7. Don't use active_file obsidian MCP methods unless absolutely necessary and then ONLY after checking which file is active first. 

## Starting Point

Please begin with **Phase 2, Step 2.0**: Review Context and Phase 1 Results

Read the plan and phase 1 summary, then guide me through the next steps one at a time.
