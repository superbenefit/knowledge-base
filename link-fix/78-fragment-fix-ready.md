# Fragment Link Fix - Ready to Execute

**Created**: 2025-08-03
**Status**: Templates ready, awaiting execution

## What We've Prepared

### Fix Templates Created:

1. **T17-Fragment-Link-Fixer.md**
   - Fixes incorrect pipe syntax in fragments
   - Validates and corrects heading anchors
   - Creates automatic backups
   - Generates detailed fix report

2. **T18-Fragment-Fix-Rollback.md**
   - Emergency rollback capability
   - Restores from automatic backups
   - Safety net if anything goes wrong

### Documentation:
- **77-fragment-fix-guide.md** - Step-by-step execution guide

## Issues to be Fixed

From validation report (70):
- **109 invalid fragment links** out of 188 total
- Most in DAO Primitives implementation guides
- Two main patterns:
  1. Pipe syntax: `#heading|text` → needs to be `#heading`
  2. Wrong anchors: `#Groups in Developmental Phases|phase` → heading doesn't exist

## Next Steps

1. **Execute T17-Fragment-Link-Fixer**
   - Copy from templates to /link-fix/
   - Run with Templater
   - Review report (75)

2. **Re-validate with T13**
   - Confirm fixes worked
   - Check for remaining issues

3. **Manual cleanup if needed**
   - Fix any unfixable issues
   - Usually just 5-10 items

## Expected Outcome

After fixing fragment links:
- All 188 fragment links will be valid
- Links will navigate correctly
- Publishing pipeline will handle fragments properly
- Link normalization project will be TRULY complete
