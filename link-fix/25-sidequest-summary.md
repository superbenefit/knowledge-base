# Link Normalization Sidequest - Status Report

**Date**: 2025-08-02
**Phase**: Between Phase 6 and 7

## Summary

We encountered two types of issues that needed resolution before moving to Phase 7:

### 1. Code Block Issues ‚úÖ FIXED
Three files had links inside code blocks that were incorrectly converted from wikilink to markdown format:

1. **tools/plugin-notes/dataview/dataview-queries.md**
   - Issue: Example code showing `[[note]]` was converted to `[note](tools/types/note.md)`
   - Fix: Manually reverted to show correct Dataview syntax examples
   - Status: ‚úÖ FIXED

2. **tools/templates/link-fix-templates/T06-Protect-Code-Blocks.md**
   - Issue: Template had `TFile` reference error
   - Fix: Updated template to remove type checking that caused the error
   - Status: ‚úÖ FIXED

3. **notes/rpp/rpp-playbooks/playbook-working-docs/07-resource-audit.md**
   - Issue: Resource directory code block had converted links
   - Fix: Reverted links in code block to show correct example syntax
   - Status: ‚úÖ FIXED

### 2. Embed Issues - 14 Files
Files with note embeds using incorrect image syntax `![alt](path)` instead of `![[path]]`:

**Status**: Ready to fix with updated T07-Fix-Embeds template

Files affected (all in drafts):
- tools/plugin-notes/plugin-notes.md
- tools/templates/link-fix-templates/T07-Fix-Embeds.md
- 12 files in drafts/OpenCivics-Wiki/

### 3. Template Fixes ‚úÖ COMPLETED
Both T06-Protect-Code-Blocks and T07-Fix-Embeds templates had errors:
- Issue: Used `instanceof TFile` without proper Obsidian API reference
- Fix: Removed type checking, used simpler file existence check
- Status: ‚úÖ Both templates updated and ready to use

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Embeds** (15 minutes):
   - Copy updated T07-Fix-Embeds to /link-fix/
   - Run in "All Embeds" mode
   - Verify all 14 files fixed

2. **Final Validation** (10 minutes):
   - Run T11-Complete-Vault-Audit
   - Confirm 0 issues remain
   - Document completion

3. **Optional - Links Directory** (20 minutes):
   - Process 30 files in /links/ directory
   - Low priority - external resource links
