*[Decentralized](tags/decentralization.md) [Autonomous](tags/autonomy.md) Organizations (DAOs) are blockchain-based coordination systems that enable groups to govern shared resources and make decisions collectively without centralized control, using transparent rules encoded in smart contracts to align incentives around common goals.*

DAOs represent a fundamental shift in how people organize, moving beyond traditional hierarchical structures to create more flexible, transparent, and participatory systems. At their core, DAOs combine technological infrastructure (blockchain, tokens, smart contracts) with social coordination mechanisms to enable distributed governance while maintaining coherence and purpose alignment. They enable stakeholders to collaborate, allocate resources, and make decisions through transparent processes that are secured and executed by code rather than relying on trusted intermediaries or central authorities.

The underlying technology provides cryptographic guarantees that agreements will be executed as specified, while the social layer creates the conditions for effective human collaboration across contexts and scales. This combination allows DAOs to experiment with novel governance models that can be more responsive, inclusive, and adaptable than traditional organizational structures, while also operating with greater transparency and lower coordination costs.

## Uses of "DAO"

The term "DAO" has evolved to encompass multiple interpretations and implementations, each emphasizing different aspects of decentralized coordination:

### DAOs as Legal Entities

In some jurisdictions, DAOs can be legally recognized organizational structures (such as DAOs registered in Wyoming or DAO LLCs in the Marshall Islands). In this context, a DAO represents a legal wrapper that provides limited liability protection while enabling on-chain governance and transparent operations. This interpretation focuses on DAOs as alternatives to traditional corporate structures, with similar functions but more distributed control mechanisms.

### DAOs as Protocol Governance Systems

Many [blockchain](tags/blockchain.md) [protocols](tags/protocols.md) use DAOs to manage upgrades, parameter changes, and treasury allocations. These protocol DAOs (like MakerDAO or Uniswap) enable token holders to vote on proposals that shape the development and operation of the underlying technology. The focus here is on decentralizing control over critical infrastructure to prevent capture by any single entity while ensuring the protocol evolves to meet user needs.

### DAOs as Purpose-Aligned Networks

As described in the [DAO Primitives Project](notes/dao-primitives/dao-primitives.md), DAOs can be understood as "purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams" rather than discrete entities. This perspective views DAOs as fluid coordination systems where smaller groups (Cells) self-organize around a shared purpose while maintaining their autonomy. The network provides infrastructure for these groups to discover each other, share resources, and align activities toward common goals without requiring centralized direction.

As noted in [DAOs aren't things... they are flows](artifacts/articles/network-evolution 1/DAOs aren't things... they are flows..md):

> "If we can shed this 'company as centralising entity' paradigm and instead see DAOs not as entities but as centerless networks with coordinated flows of resources, then a whole new way of looking at business and economics becomes possible."

### DAOs as Experimental Spaces

DAOs also represent laboratories for social, economic, and governance experimentation. They provide infrastructure for testing novel coordination mechanisms, incentive structures, and decision-making processes at scale. This usage emphasizes DAOs as vehicles for institutional innovation, enabling communities to rapidly iterate on organizational designs that would be difficult to implement within traditional structures.

### DAOs as Network Economies

Unlike companies that operate business models, DAOs can function as network economies that harness both scaling infrastructure and creative networks. As described in [Scale and the levers that provide DAOs their power](artifacts/articles/network-evolution 1/Scale and the levers that provide DAOs their power.md), this enables DAOs to achieve efficiencies similar to traditional organizations while maintaining the innovation capacity typically lost in rigid hierarchies.

> "DAOs are network economies, not business models. And as network economies they can be more like cities and can escape the rigid and finite fate of companies."

## Key Characteristics of DAOs

While implementations vary widely, most DAOs share several defining characteristics:

1. **Distributed Decision-Making**: Authority is distributed across members rather than concentrated in a management hierarchy.

2. **Transparent Operations**: Transactions, governance processes, and resource allocations are publicly visible on the blockchain.

3. **Programmable Governance**: Rules for coordination and decision-making are encoded in smart contracts, ensuring consistent enforcement.

4. **Token-Based Participation**: Rights to participation, governance, and economic benefits are often represented by tokens or other cryptographic credentials.

5. **Purpose Alignment**: Members coordinate around shared goals, values, or objectives rather than being directed by centralized authority.

6. **Permissionless Access**: Many DAOs allow anyone to participate in some capacity without requiring approval from gatekeepers.

7. **Multi-Scale Governance**: Different decision-making processes operate at different scales, from small autonomous teams to network-wide votes.
