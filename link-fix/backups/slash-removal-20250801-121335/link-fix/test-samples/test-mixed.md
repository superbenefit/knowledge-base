# Mixed Link Patterns Test

This file contains both types of links:

## Wikilinks Section
- Exploring [[/tags/web3|Web3]] technology
- Understanding [[/tags/governance|governance]] models
- Working with [[/tags/daos|DAOs]]

## Markdown Links Section
- Read the [documentation](/docs/readme.md)
- Check our [governance guide](/artifacts/patterns/governance.md)
- View the [main index](/index.md)

## Mixed in Same Paragraph
In our [[/tags/decentralization|decentralized]] approach, we use [these patterns](/patterns/index.md) 
to build better [[/tags/coordination|coordination]] systems. See more in our [guide](/guides/overview.md).

Total: 5 wikilinks + 5 markdown links = 10 links with leading slashes
