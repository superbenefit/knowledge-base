Oct 19:

I had a chat with Scott Morris and made some plans to set up a call once we're further along in the Bio-Muni project.

We also did some ecosystem sniffing and landed on a recommendation that we get ICS set up with basic, high-level infrastructure for your financing facilities on Gnosis Chain. That'll give you more options for experimenting in the future, getting creative with fiscal stewardship, etc.

I also got access to a new multisig for small teams that doesn't require key management, so we can more readily approach the experiment scope you proposed. Scott also provided this [Figma resource](https://www.figma.com/board/F4mjtohKgwIiGBp7oHq7z1/Value-Flow-Compass-Template?node-id=0-1&t=iL5hClFjHpVe9OVb-1), which can help guide some of the deeper discovery as we move forward into experimentation. This can be done in parallel to other work, as a way to record learnings and decisions.

First step would be to get ya'll set up with the onchain basics. Like a governance contract, signers, and basic tooling like Hats. Then we can plug in more organizational Legos as we experiment with them.

By setting up on Gnosis, that lets you access all of their features (like Gnosis Pay, free multisig txns, etc), and puts you in-Network with all the relevant protocols and apps that align with your community's stated values. And you can have more control over your infrastructure choices.

(the next closest is Celo, but they're not production-ready yet unfortunately)

Mostly though, it's because OpenCollective is launching their crypto fork in the Gnosis ecosystem, which will serve your administrative needs best. ðŸ™‚
