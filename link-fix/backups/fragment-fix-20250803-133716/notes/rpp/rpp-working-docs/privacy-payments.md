*A pattern for implementing secure, private payment systems to support social impact projects in challenging environments*

**Privacy Payments** are systems for [distributing resources](tags/payments.md) [privately](tags/privacy.md) and reliably in challenging contexts, using smart contracts and [cryptographically-secured infrastructure](tags/blockchain.md). This enables organizations to work effectively when traditional financial systems are compromised or inaccessible.

## Why Use Private Payments?

Grassroots organizations and institutional funders face significant challenges in distributing resources effectively and ethically. Traditional banking systems frequently prove inadequate or even actively obstructive. Inaccessibility stems from various factors: political instability leading to banking closures or restrictions on transactions, infrastructure failures disrupting financial services in remote areas, and systemic exclusion preventing marginalized communities from accessing formal banking channels. 

Even when banking systems are functional, financial surveillance poses substantial risks. Recipient identities may be exposed, jeopardizing their safety and potentially leading to reprisals. This surveillance can also deter funders from supporting critical work, particularly in politically sensitive contexts.

### Solution Landscape

Humanitarian aid distribution faces unique challenges in resource-constrained and politically volatile environments. Several approaches exist, each with trade-offs between simplicity, security, scalability, and privacy:

#### Traditional Methods

- **Paper-based systems:** These rely on physical lists and vouchers. While simple, they lack scalability, are easily forged, and are unsuitable for large-scale or high-security distributions.
- **Centralized digital systems:** These utilize existing digital identity systems to track aid distribution. While improving scalability and security over paper-based methods, they often collect extensive personal data, raising significant privacy concerns and potentially endangering recipients. Examples include biometric identification systems used by some UN agencies.

#### Decentralized Approaches

- **Decentralized token-based systems:** These systems employ tokens (on smart cards or smartphones) to distribute aid while minimizing data collection. This approach offers scalability, strong accountability, and inherent privacy protections. However, it requires careful consideration of hardware and connectivity limitations common in crisis zones.
- **Privacy-Preserving Crypto Payments:** This pattern represents a significant advancement in decentralized approaches. It leverages the security and privacy features of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts to overcome the limitations of previous methods. This approach is particularly advantageous in situations where:
    - **High levels of recipient privacy are critical:** The anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies and privacy-enhancing technologies is essential when financial surveillance poses a direct threat.
    - **Traditional financial systems are unreliable or inaccessible:** Cryptocurrency infrastructure operates independently of traditional banking, offering resilience in unstable or conflict-affected regions.
    - **Cross-border payments are restricted:** Cryptocurrency transactions can circumvent geopolitical restrictions on traditional transfers.
    - **Auditable transparency is required:** Smart contracts provide a transparent and auditable transaction record while preserving recipient privacy.
    - **Financial system extraction is a concern:** Traditional financial intermediaries often extract significant fees from humanitarian transactions. Decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions reduce reliance on these extractive middlemen, maximizing the impact of aid funds.

## How Private Crypto Payments Work

Onchain privacy payments system use blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to securely and privately distribute aid in areas where traditional banking is unreliable or unavailable. It works by coordinating three key components:

**1. Secure Treasury Management:** This system manages the aid funds. It uses advanced security measures like multi-signature wallets, requiring multiple approvals for any transaction, to prevent unauthorized access. Robust key management and strict access controls further enhance security. This ensures that the funds are protected from theft or misuse.

**2. Privacy-Preserving Distribution:** Instead of using personal data, recipients receive digital tokens representing their aid entitlement. These tokens, stored on smart cards or mobile devices, are used at distribution points to claim aid. This minimizes the information revealed to distribution staff and prevents the creation of traceable links between recipients and their aid.

**3. Robust Security Controls:** Smart contracts automate the release of funds based on pre-defined rules, ensuring aid is distributed correctly and transparently. The blockchain’s permanent and tamper-proof record of transactions provides a reliable audit trail, addressing accountability concerns. The decentralized nature of the system makes it resilient to disruptions in traditional financial systems. The use of cryptocurrencies allows for cross-border payments, bypassing certain restrictions.

These three components work together to create a system that is both secure and private. The secure treasury protects the funds, the privacy-preserving distribution protects recipient identities, and the robust security controls ensure accountability and resilience. This approach offers a more reliable and ethical way to distribute aid in challenging environments.

### Affordances

Privacy Payments offer several key advantages:

- **Enhanced Privacy:** The system minimizes the collection and storage of personal data, protecting recipients from surveillance and potential harm. Pseudonymous transactions and privacy-enhancing technologies (like mixers and coinjoins) further enhance anonymity.
- **Improved Security:** Blockchain technology and smart contracts provide a secure and tamper-proof system for managing and distributing funds, reducing the risk of fraud and theft. Multi-signature wallets and robust key management protocols add an extra layer of security.
- **Increased Scalability:** The system can handle large-scale distributions efficiently, unlike traditional paper-based systems. The use of smart contracts automates many processes, reducing the administrative burden.
- **Enhanced Transparency and Auditability:** Smart contracts provide a transparent and auditable record of all transactions, allowing for verification of fund distribution without compromising recipient privacy.
- **Resilience:** The decentralized nature of the system makes it more resilient to disruptions in traditional financial systems. It can function effectively even in unstable or conflict-affected regions.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** By reducing reliance on intermediaries and automating processes, the system can lead to significant cost savings, especially compared to traditional methods. This aligns with the UN OCHA’s emphasis on cost savings in humanitarian operations [2](attachments/Blockchain Humanitarian Opportunities.pdf).

### Risks and Opportunities

Implementing Privacy Payments presents several challenges:

1. **Political/Legal Risk:** Navigating regulatory complexities surrounding cryptocurrencies, ensuring compliance with AML/KYC regulations, and establishing clear documentation of charitable purpose are crucial. Maintaining jurisdictional diversity in infrastructure to mitigate regulatory risks is also important.
2. **Technical Operations:** Secure key management, user training on secure wallet operation, and maintaining system security through updates and penetration testing are essential. Addressing hardware and connectivity limitations, as highlighted by the ICRC’s research [1](https://app.khoj.dev/aid-distribution-paper(1).md), is also critical.
3. **Organizational Security:** Protecting participant identities, securing communications, and establishing robust incident response protocols are vital for maintaining the integrity and security of the system.

Addressing these risks is crucial for successful implementation. However, the potential benefits of enhanced privacy, security, scalability, and resilience outweigh the challenges, particularly in contexts where traditional financial systems are inadequate or pose significant risks to vulnerable populations. The potential for cost savings and increased efficiency also makes this approach attractive for humanitarian and social impact projects.
