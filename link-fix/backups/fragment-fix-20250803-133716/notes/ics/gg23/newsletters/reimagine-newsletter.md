# Reimagine Co Newsletter: Support Our Sustainability Work in a New Way!

![Reimagine Co image]

Hello Reimagine Community!

**We're Trying Something New & Need Your Help** ðŸŒ±

As many of you know, Reimagine Co has grown beyond our package-free grocery roots to include community sustainability programs like the Repair CafÃ© and Thing Library. These initiatives are now supported by our non-profit arm, the Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS).

**Today, we're asking for a small favor that would make a big difference.**

## A Special Opportunity

ICS is participating in our first-ever Gitcoin Grants Round - a unique funding approach that uses something called "quadratic funding" to make small donations incredibly powerful.

**What makes this special:**
- Even a tiny donation ($2-20) significantly boosts our matching funds
- The number of supporters matters more than the amount
- It's a new way to sustain our community programs long-term

## Super Easy to Support (No Crypto Knowledge Needed!)

You can help us with just a few clicks:

**Simple Option:**
- Donate via [Credit Card or PayPal here] (YOUR PAYPAL LINK)
- Takes less than 2 minutes!

**Web3 Option (if you're curious):**
- Donate through [Gitcoin here](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/31/52)
- [Learn how this works](https://wtfisqf.com)

## Why This Matters for Reimagine's Future

We see these new funding models as key to our long-term sustainability. They align perfectly with our values of community ownership, transparency, and resilience.

We've been exploring how web3 tools can enhance our sustainability work, including:
- Launching a Green Pill London chapter (more info coming soon!)
- Documenting our Repair CafÃ© and Thing Library impact
- Participating in the [Reimagining Power Project](https://pub.superbenefit.org/reimagining-power-how-web3-can-transform-social-impact)

## Please Donate Now - Just $2-20!

This funding round closes on April 16th, and your support would mean the world to us. After 6 years of building Reimagine and its community programs, your small contribution helps ensure we can continue this important work.
