This collection of articles explores an approach to understanding and designing Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) as networked systems rather than traditional entities. Written primarily by Rowan Yeoman with contributions from Michael Lewkowitz, Heenal Rajani, and others from the SuperBenefit community, the series examines how DAOs might function as networks with different properties than conventional organizations.

## Series Overview

The five articles in this series offer perspectives on DAO design that focus on network dynamics and distributed coordination. They explore how DAOs might operate as "purpose-aligned networks of small autonomous teams" and examine different approaches to scaling, governance, and organization.

These articles discuss potential ways to address common questions in the DAO ecosystem, such as how decentralized organizations might scale while balancing efficiency with innovation, and how permissionless access might be implemented in practice.


## Themes and Concepts

### Network-Based Organization

The series begins by examining DAOs through a network lens. "DAOs aren't things... they are flows" proposes viewing DAOs as "centerless networks with coordinated flows of resources" rather than as digital versions of traditional companies. This perspective connects to the broader concept of [networks](tags/networks.md) in decentralized systems.

### Scaling Considerations

In "Scale and the levers that provide DAOs their power," the series draws on Geoffrey West's work on scaling laws to examine two patterns:

1. **Sub-linear scaling** through fractal hierarchies that can create efficiency as systems grow
2. **Super-linear scaling** through social networks that can generate innovation and creativity

The articles suggest that DAOs might potentially combine aspects of both these scaling patterns. This exploration relates to the [scale](tags/scale.md) concept in the lexicon, which discusses different operational scales and their distinct dynamics.

### Cell-Based Organization

"DAOs: From fractal primitives to network scale" introduces the concept of DAOs as networks of connected "cells" - autonomous teams that maintain independence while coordinating with a broader network. This approach has connections to the lexicon's discussions of [cells](notes/archive/clarity/Tags/cells.md) and how [groups](tags/groups.md) might function at different scales.

### Access and Participation

"Minimum Viable Permissionless-ness" explores potential approaches to participation in DAOs, distinguishing between "access to resources" and "access to the network." The article proposes three elements for participation:

1. The freedom to work on something without requiring permission
2. The ability to attract others to a project
3. The right to put up proposals to the broader network

These ideas relate to concepts like [permissions](tags/permissions.md) and [autonomy](tags/autonomy.md) in the lexicon.

### Governance Approaches

The series concludes with "Building DAOs as scalable networks," which proposes a two-house model with:

1. **Community Governance**: Focusing on purpose and long-term direction
2. **Operational Governance**: Addressing day-to-day execution

This approach has connections to the lexicon's exploration of [governance](tags/governance.md) at different scales and the balance between [coordination](tags/coordination.md) and autonomy.

## Practical Context

The ideas presented in this series offer one perspective on how DAOs might be conceptualized and designed. They represent explorations rather than definitive solutions, and readers are encouraged to consider them alongside other approaches in the evolving DAO ecosystem.

These articles connect to several ongoing discussions within the SuperBenefit knowledge base, including the [DAO Primitives Project](artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/dao-primitives-framework.md) and various governance explorations documented in the [Governance for better futures](artifacts/articles/governance-for-better-futures/governance-for-better-futures.md) series.

For those interested in decentralized coordination, this series provides one framework among many for thinking about how DAOs might operate as network-based organizations.
