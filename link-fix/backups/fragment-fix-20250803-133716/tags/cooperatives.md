_A cooperative is an autonomous association of persons who voluntarily unite to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise, operating according to internationally recognized principles of member ownership, democratic governance, and equitable distribution of benefits._

Cooperatives represent a fundamentally different approach to enterprise ownership and governance than conventional businesses. Unlike investor-owned firms that concentrate control and direct benefits primarily to external shareholders, cooperatives distribute both ownership and decision-making power across their membership, who may be workers, consumers, producers, or other stakeholders directly engaged with the enterprise. This structure creates organizations inherently oriented toward serving member needs rather than maximizing financial returns for investors, establishing operational accountability to the people most affected by the enterprise's activities.

In practice, cooperatives operationalize their principles through specific governance mechanisms, including one-member-one-vote democratic control, transparent decision-making processes, limits on external capital influence, and equitable distribution of surpluses. These structures create enterprises capable of balancing economic viability with social purpose, addressing market failures where conventional firms fall short, and building resilient community wealth. While cooperative principles remain consistent across contexts, cooperatives manifest in diverse forms—from small worker-owned businesses to large agricultural producer co-ops to community-owned utilities—each adapting the model to specific member needs and conditions.

## Uses of "Cooperative"

### Worker Cooperatives

Worker cooperatives are businesses owned and democratically governed by their employees, who collectively make strategic decisions, share in profits, and often participate in day-to-day management. This model transforms workplace relationships by eliminating the traditional division between capital and labor.

These cooperatives typically distribute surplus (profit) based on labor contribution rather than capital investment, with governance structures ranging from direct democracy in smaller organizations to elected boards in larger ones. Worker cooperatives have demonstrated particular resilience during economic downturns, as their decision-making prioritizes job preservation and long-term viability over short-term profit maximization.

### Consumer Cooperatives

Consumer cooperatives are owned and governed by the people who use their services, creating enterprises designed to meet consumer needs rather than maximize profit. These range from retail food co-ops to utilities and insurance providers, all structured to deliver quality goods and services at fair prices while maintaining accountability to customer-members.

These cooperatives implement democratic governance through membership systems that give each customer-member voting rights, often returning economic benefits through patronage dividends based on individual purchasing. They frequently emphasize product quality, sustainability, and ethical sourcing, as their governance directly reflects the priorities of the people using their products and services.

### Producer Cooperatives

Producer cooperatives unite individual producers—such as farmers, artisans, or independent professionals—who collectively own enterprises for processing, marketing, or distributing their products. This model creates economies of scale and market access while preserving individual autonomy.

These cooperatives typically allocate voting rights and distribute benefits based on member patronage, creating proportional influence while maintaining democratic principles. They are particularly common in agriculture, enabling family farms to access processing facilities, distribution networks, and marketing capabilities that would be inaccessible to individual producers.

### Platform Cooperatives

Platform cooperatives apply cooperative principles to digital platforms, creating alternatives to venture capital-funded platform companies. These enterprises develop technologies owned and controlled by the users, workers, and other stakeholders who depend on and contribute value to the platform.

This model addresses critiques of the dominant platform economy by ensuring value flows to the communities that generate it rather than being extracted by external investors. Platform cooperatives use blockchain and Web3 technologies to enable transparent governance and value distribution, creating digital commons that serve community needs while maintaining technical innovation.

## Cooperatives and Web3

The convergence of cooperative principles with Web3 technologies creates possibilities for reinventing economic relationships in digital space. Blockchain provides technical infrastructure for cooperative principles like democratic control and economic participation, while smart contracts can encode operational rules and automate processes like profit distribution according to democratically established parameters.

Web3 technologies enable cooperatives to overcome geographic limitations, creating global networks united by shared purpose rather than location. These systems can incorporate both formal membership and more permeable participation structures, using reputation systems to distribute governance rights and economic benefits across diverse contributor communities.

## Cooperatives and DAOs

Cooperatives and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) represent distinct but convergent approaches to democratic ownership and governance. While traditional cooperatives operate through legally recognized structures within national jurisdictions, DAOs implement similar principles through blockchain-based smart contracts and token governance, often operating across jurisdictional boundaries.

Key differences include cooperatives' emphasis on face-to-face relationships and one-member-one-vote principles versus DAOs' capacity for coordinating globally distributed participants, often through token-weighted voting. Cooperatives benefit from established legal frameworks but face capital constraints, while DAOs enable rapid capital formation through tokenization but operate in evolving regulatory environments.

Emerging hybrid approaches combine cooperative legal structures with DAO governance mechanisms, creating organizations that benefit from both institutional legitimacy and technological innovation while maintaining democratic ownership at global scale.
