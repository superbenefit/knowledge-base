**Modules** are self-contained, interchangeable units or components that perform specific functions within a larger system, allowing for flexibility, customization, and scalability when building or modifying that system.

## Uses of "Modules"

The term *modules* is used across various contexts to describe different types of self-contained components: in organizational design, they represent functional units of processes or teams; in grassroots movements and nonprofit organizations, they refer to adaptable, repeatable strategies or tools for mobilization; in coordination systems, they enable flexible collaboration structures; and in blockchain technology, they are units of code or governance mechanisms that can be independently developed, deployed, and integrated into larger systems for decentralized management.

### Modules in web3 and DAO systems

In web3 and DAO contexts, *modules* are composable, interoperable technical components (smart contracts, APIs, protocols) or governance mechanisms that perform specific functions while maintaining compatibility with other system elements. These modules can be selectively implemented to create customized governance structures, enabling DAOs to adapt their operations to specific needs without rebuilding entire systems.

The modular approach is particularly valuable for DAOs because it enables experimentation with different governance structures through "mix and match" capabilities. By isolating specific functions into discrete modules—such as voting mechanisms, treasury management, dispute resolution, or permission systems—DAOs can evolve incrementally, replacing or upgrading individual components without disrupting the entire organization. This approach also facilitates knowledge sharing across the ecosystem, as successful modules can be reused and adapted by different communities.

### Modules in systems and org design

In the context of organization and systems design, *modules* are configurable, self-contained components that perform specific governance functions, which can be combined and modified to form larger, more complex systems.

Modules allow for flexibility in designing organizational processes by enabling users to select and arrange different components to meet their needs. These components can operate independently or in combination with others, facilitating customization and scalability. In decentralized systems, such as those found in Web3, modules support interoperability and portability, allowing governance tools to be shared across different platforms and adapted to new contexts efficiently.

### Modules in the DAO Primitives Framework

Within the [DAO Primitives Framework](tags/primitives.md), modules represent the technical implementations of patterns and primitives. They serve as building blocks that operationalize governance concepts, connecting abstract principles to functional systems. The framework uses modules as the practical tools through which primitives (core concepts) and patterns (reusable solutions) are deployed in actual DAO contexts.

For example, a DAO might implement modules for:
- Treasury management and multisignature authorization
- Proposal creation, discussion, and voting
- Member onboarding and reputation tracking
- Dispute resolution and governance parameter adjustment
- Permission management and role-based access control
