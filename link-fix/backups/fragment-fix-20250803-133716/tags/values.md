_Values are core principles and desired characteristics that guide decision-making, system design, and operations, embodying the aspirations and ethical commitments that shape how organizations and networks function and evolve._

Values serve as both normative guidance and practical design considerations in decentralized systems. They represent the fundamental principles that communities commit to upholding while also describing the desired qualities that systems should embody. Unlike rigid rules, values provide flexible orientation points that help navigate trade-offs and resolve conflicts when concrete decisions must be made in complex or ambiguous situations.

In decentralized contexts, values take on particular importance as they often replace traditional command structures by creating alignment around shared priorities and commitments. When explicitly articulated and collectively endorsed, values enable autonomous agents to make consistent decisions without requiring constant oversight or detailed instructions. This makes values essential coordination mechanisms for networks where centralized control is neither possible nor desirable.

## Uses of "Values"

### Values in DAO Formation and Governance

During the formation phase of DAOs and decentralized organizations, establishing shared values creates a foundation for effective collaboration and decision-making. These values help diverse stakeholders align around common priorities and provide guidance for navigating trade-offs in organizational design, tool selection, and governance processes.

Values in DAO governance often include principles like transparency, decentralization, inclusivity, and accountability. These serve as both aspirational goals and practical design considerations. For example, the value of decentralization might guide decisions about permission structures, while transparency values shape information sharing protocols and documentation practices.

As described in the DAO Primitives Framework, values influence how qualities like autonomy, privacy, and sustainability are operationalized in specific contexts. They help bridge between abstract principles and concrete implementation choices, allowing teams to maintain coherence while adapting to their unique circumstances.

### Values in Systems Transformation

In the context of social impact and systems transformation initiatives like Reimagining Power, values play a crucial role in reshaping existing structures and creating more equitable alternatives. Values-driven approaches recognize that technological systems are not neutral but embody specific priorities and power dynamics.

Web3 technologies offer unique opportunities to encode values like equity, privacy, and autonomy directly into system architecture through smart contracts and decentralized governance. This "values-by-design" approach creates more resilient implementation of principles that might otherwise be compromised by market pressures or power imbalances.

For example, privacy values can be encoded through zero-knowledge proof mechanisms, while equity values might be implemented through transparent resource allocation protocols or quadratic funding mechanisms. This technical implementation of values creates systems that structurally reinforce desired characteristics rather than merely aspiring to them.

### Values at Different Scales and Scopes

Values operate at multiple scales within decentralized systems, from individual contributors to working groups to entire networks. Different contexts may prioritize different values based on their specific needs and challenges:

- **Individual level**: Personal values guide contributor actions and decisions
- **Team level**: Shared values enable coordination within working groups or cells
- **Network level**: Core values create coherence across the broader ecosystem
- **Inter-network level**: Aligned values facilitate cooperation between different DAOs and communities

This multi-scale approach recognizes that while certain foundational values may be universal, their practical application and relative priority can vary based on context. Teams working on privacy-sensitive applications may emphasize confidentiality values, while public-facing initiatives might prioritize transparency and accessibility.

## Common Values in Decentralized Systems

While each community develops its own unique value set, several core values frequently appear in decentralized systems:

- **Autonomy**: Enabling self-determination at individual and group levels
- **Transparency**: Making processes, decisions, and information openly accessible
- **Decentralization**: Distributing power, control, and resources rather than concentrating them
- **Privacy**: Protecting sensitive information and enabling confidential participation
- **Sustainability**: Creating systems that can maintain themselves over time without extraction
- **Inclusivity**: Enabling diverse participation regardless of background or resources
- **Adaptability**: Building systems that can evolve in response to changing conditions

These values often manifest as qualities that systems embody to varying degrees. For example, the value of privacy might be expressed through technical qualities like data minimization, selective disclosure, or zero-knowledge mechanisms.
