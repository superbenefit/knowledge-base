# Test File for Markdown Link Patterns

This file contains markdown links that need fixing:

## Simple Markdown Links
- Check out the [CONTRIBUTING guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- See our [README file](/README.md) for more info
- Visit the [artifacts section](/artifacts/readme.md)

## Complex Paths
- Read about [network evolution](/artifacts/articles/network-evolution/network-evolution.md)
- Learn about [governance patterns](/artifacts/patterns/operational-governance.md)

## Mixed Content
Here's a paragraph with a [link to tags](/tags/daos.md) in the middle.

Another line with multiple links: [first link](/index.md) and [second link](/tags/web3.md).

Total: 8 markdown links with leading slashes
