# Impact Yield Fund (IYF) Documentation

This directory contains documentation and planning materials for the Impact Yield Fund (IYF), a novel financial structure that preserves capital while generating sustainable returns for investors and continuous support for community exchange networks through yield allocation.

## Purpose

The Impact Yield Fund aims to create a virtuous cycle where:
1. Capital is preserved
2. Investors receive stable returns
3. Excess yield supports community initiatives
4. On-chain impact is tracked transparently

## Directory Structure

- **[I.01-impact-yield-fund-concept.md](./I.01-impact-yield-fund-concept.md)** - Overview of the Impact Yield Fund concept, structure, and key components
- **[I.02-meeting-notes.md](./I.02-meeting-notes.md)** - Compilation of meeting notes and discussions related to the fund
- **[I.03-diagrams-and-visuals.md](./I.03-diagrams-and-visuals.md)** - Key diagrams illustrating the fund structure and flows
- **[I.04-project-plan.md](./I.04-project-plan.md)** - Step-by-step plan for developing and implementing the fund
- **[I.05-discussion-paper-outline.md](./I.05-discussion-paper-outline.md)** - Outline for the formal discussion paper to share with potential funders

## Connection to Community Exchange

While the Impact Yield Fund and Community Exchange Commitment Pools (CCC) are distinct projects that can be pursued independently, they have significant synergistic potential. The excess yield from the fund can seed commitment pools, creating a powerful multiplier effect where each dollar of yield can support 5-10x its value in community exchange commitments.

## Key Partners

- SuperBenefit (fund administration and technical design)
- Boann Finance (potential seed investor)
- ICS (local implementation partner)

## Current Status

The fund concept has been developed and discussed internally at SuperBenefit. Initial conversations with Boann Finance indicate potential interest in this approach. The next step is creating a formal discussion paper for potential funders and developing a small-scale pilot in London, Ontario.
