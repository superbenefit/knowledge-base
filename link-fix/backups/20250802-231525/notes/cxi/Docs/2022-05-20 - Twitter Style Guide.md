# Twitter Guidelines for SuperBenefit
In the world of web3 Twitter is currently recognised as part of the connection mix. As ownership changes take hold and new web3 platforms emerge this is something to keep a watch on. Platforms like [Islands ](https://islands.xyz/)are new but looking to be the â€˜homepageâ€™ or passport to the metaverse. But for now - DAOs still look to Twitter to engage.
## So how should SuperBenefit present on Twitter?
### Tone
The tone across web3 twitter is overwhelmingly informal. Itâ€™s casual, itâ€™s friendly, it reflects the ethos that weâ€™re all explorers together.Â 
### Format
- When youâ€™re posting a few sentences, itâ€™s common to take up space in the thread by leaving a space (carriage return) between sentences.
- If emojiâ€™s fit the theme and tone of your post donâ€™t be afraid to use them, but theyâ€™re not a must.
- Avoid Hashtags or use very sparingly. Itâ€™s often seen to be engagement farming and mostly done by those who are marketing. Judicious use could be a bridge to newbies in the space.
- Threads ðŸ§µ are right on trend for longer thoughts or complex discussions.
- But ultimately - if you share great content that contributes to the pool of knowledge and sensemaking it doesnâ€™t matter so much how it looks.

### Â Content
- Share broadly, but **aligned to SuperBenefit Purpose + Mission**. So if there are interesting creators getting things out there that are related to the mission or live projects, share them. It shows weâ€™re plugged in, and it goes to the heart of all â€˜islandsâ€™ rising with the tide.
- **Work out loud **with content the DAO is creating. Share it all generously.
- Â Echo what youâ€™re sharing elsewhere â€“ e.g. proposals.
- Announce events / townhalls etc.
- **Share / tag** partner DAOs and people in the broader ecosystem (especially ones with aligned values and strong community following) in posts that are related to them / their work. If youâ€™re tagging to bring a tweet to their attention, only tag in the comments. In general avoid tagging more than three others at a time (unless the whole point of your tweet is to list people / orgs doing a certain thing)
- Keep a look out for tweets from community members and amplify them where it fits.
