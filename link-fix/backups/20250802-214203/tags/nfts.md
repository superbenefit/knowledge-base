_Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique, indivisible digital assets recorded on a blockchain that enable verifiable ownership and provenance of digital or physical items, creating new possibilities for representation, governance, and value exchange in decentralized systems._

Unlike fungible tokens (where each unit is identical and interchangeable, like cryptocurrencies), NFTs contain distinct properties that make each token unique and non-interchangeable. This uniqueness enables NFTs to represent ownership of specific items—from digital art and virtual land to governance rights and real-world assets. By providing cryptographic proof of authenticity and ownership history, NFTs transform how we establish provenance, transfer rights, and build community around shared assets in digital environments.

Beyond their initial popularization as digital collectibles, NFTs have evolved into sophisticated coordination tools that enable new forms of collective organization, decentralized governance, and resource management. Their programmable nature allows communities to encode rights, responsibilities, and relationships directly into digital assets, creating dynamic systems for participation that extend far beyond simple ownership claims.

## Uses of "Non-Fungible Tokens"

### NFTs in Digital Commons and Community Governance

In decentralized communities and DAOs, NFTs function as governance instruments that enable participation, representation, and coordinated resource management. By encoding access rights, voting power, or contribution history within tokens, communities can create governance systems with transparent rules and verifiable membership.

NFTs can represent:

- Governance rights in specific decision domains
- Proof of contribution or participation
- Stewardship responsibilities for community resources
- Access to shared spaces or exclusive information

Unlike simple membership tokens, governance NFTs can have distinct properties that reflect different roles, expertise domains, or levels of participation within a community. This granularity allows for more nuanced governance structures that respect the diverse capabilities and interests of community members while maintaining transparent, verifiable legitimacy.

### NFTs in Social Impact and Public Goods

In social impact contexts, NFTs offer mechanisms for directing resources toward public goods, environmental regeneration, and community development. Impact certificates, regenerative asset protocols, and community contribution tokens all leverage NFT properties to create more transparent, efficient systems for tracking and rewarding positive externalities.

Applications include:

- Environmental assets that represent carbon sequestration or biodiversity protection
- Impact certificates that tokenize verified social outcomes
- Community contribution tokens that recognize non-financial inputs
- Heritage preservation tools that maintain cultural assets as community commons

These implementations move beyond market speculation to create genuine instruments for directing resources toward regenerative activities. By making impact claims verifiable and transferable, NFTs enable new economic models that align incentives with community and ecological wellbeing.

### NFTs in Digital Identity and Reputation

NFTs can represent aspects of digital identity, credentials, and reputation in ways that preserve privacy while enabling selective disclosure. Unlike traditional identity systems that centralize personal data, NFT-based approaches allow individuals to control their information while still proving claims or attributes when needed.

Applications in this domain include:

- Verifiable credentials and certificates
- Reputation tokens that represent expertise or trust
- Contribution history that showcases past work
- Community memberships that grant specific rights and privileges

When combined with privacy-preserving technologies like zero-knowledge proofs, these systems can enable selective disclosure—allowing users to prove they possess certain attributes without revealing all their personal information. This balance between verification and privacy is essential for building ethical digital identity systems that empower users rather than extracting from them.
