Central to web3 is restoring balance between people and planet and this in those who have been my teachers and guides links to understanding how colonized ways has got us to the imbalance we face now and with web3 holding potential 

my background is in network building, social impact sector with nonprofit and philanthropy and on journey of learning and unlearning related to Indigenous reconciliation and see such promise and abundance in web3 and keep sensing we have possibility and are and could continue to replicate the opppressive systems that have excluded Indignenous and other histoircally excluded groups
Moderator: Michelle Baldwin

## Title of Session: Decolonizing web3

How can we have web3 happen with us to not us, and this requires intentionality for what we are building with the future to 
Web3 borrows from Indigenous ways of knowing, offers the opportunity to build anew and will require us to challenge our mental models that are built from colonized thinking and structures. Exploring how web3 emulates Indigenous ways of knowing and being, what is possible if we decolonize web3, where are we getting stuck in colonized approaches in web3 and how will we hold ourselves and one another accountable to not repeat mistakes of the past.

What aspects are decolonized?

In what ways internet/web1/web3 colonized?
In what ways is web3 currently colonized?
- concentration of wealth in same old hands and perpetuates and exacebeerates wealth in fewer hands then even wider world
- co-opting Indigenous ways as new in web3 is stark and distressing
- idea of ownership, not very nuanced, collective ownership, not a two way ownership
	- humans having power over something, relationship with wider world

How can we shift web3 to be decolonized?

WHAT WORK IS ALREADY HAPPENING IN DECOLONIZING WEB3 - WHAT DO WE DRAW
WHAT ELSE NEEDS TO BE DONE - WHAT IS SOMETHING PRACTICALLY THEY CAN DO

## Good questions for decolonizing web3 to borrow from and could be adapted for a twitter chat or summit panel 
- What are the conditions that make possible ethical and rigorous engagement across communities in historical dissonance that can help us move together towards improved relationships and yet-unimaginable wiser futures, as we face unprecedented global challenges?
- What are the guidelines and practices for ethical and respectful engagement with Indigenous senses and sensibilities (being, knowing, relationships, trauma, place, space and time) that can help us to work together in holding space for the possibility of “braiding” work?
- How do we learn together to enliven these guidelines with (self-)compassion, generosity, humility, flexibility and rigour, and without turning our back to (or burning out with) the complexities, paradoxes, difficulties and pain of this process of healing?
- What kind of socially engaged and community anchored Indigenous-led arts-based program can support this process in the long term?
	- What are the expectations in terms of the responsibilities of the organization to the place/land and her traditional ancestral custodians from the perspective of the local Indigenous communities?
- How do we include historical and modern understandings of race, class, and privilege while also decentering professionalism that has roots within white supremacy and respectability politcs within DEI web3 orgs?

From Danaé
Indigenous woman focused on DAO for Indigenous tribes to buy our land, air, water titles back from the government and the results of our people obtaining our assets back in our ownership.

Comments
1. How do we utilize web3 to buy back our assets (titles to land, water, and air right) from the government? Eg do we set up a DAO for tribes and members to contribute to collectively purchase it back? I've been discussing several other avenues with friends who have more experience than I do.2. Do we have sovereign state law benefits to bank crypto vs US state regulations (lawyers are convinced yes but it has yet to be navigated)

## Zoom call 11apr22
Michelle, Heenal, Zi, Danae, Michael Redhead Champagne
- Danae - Navajo, lives in NYC. in the NDI, CDFI space - oversees tech infrastructure. how do we utilize this crypt banking so we're not left behind. and how do we create a DAO to buy back land and water rights. also advocates to make sure that corporations expand inclusivity to include indigenous people. working with soft bank, black rock... bought into bitcoin at $88 in 2013.
- Michael - Northern Manitoba. works to amplify voices of indigenous families and youth impacted by child welfare and other family separation systems. chair of fearless r2w. 90% of children in child welfare situation are indigenous, even though they make up 15% of population. not sure how this relates to web3, expect that we can't move forwards without these people I represent. web3 represents an opportunity to tip the scale and I want to be part of that. willing to offer myself as a bridge. not able to articulate yet to people i represent why web3 is of value. [www.fearlessr2w.ca](https://www.fearlessr2w.ca) 
- Zi - (z-"I" not zeee) - Davion Zi Ziere - being on this planet, worked to understand the world and did not feel in sync, 13 schools growing up in California and Mississipi - moving between spaces, 9 siblings, oldest, artist and systems architect - liberatory systems architecture, "anything our communities need, our communities can provide" we are the value, we need to build tools to supply to ourselves, inclusion - who is being included and who is making decision who is included. mind and body are colonized not just institutions. what does it really mean to be colonized? what gifts have we lost in the process of colonization and why do we continue to perpetuate it? salvador de bahia - people have decolonized, have released traumas. worked at Tesla and they did not get it about sincerity and how to engage people, kindness and compassion and accountability  - Mobius ecosystem building for those building liberatory technology, those who centre our freedom and our collective well being at the heart of the work doing - crypto in city, equity in a neighbourhood, open access medical tech, regenerative investors connections to these emergent groups, difficult to work within major institutions, from big tech to emergent tech. [mobi.us.org](https://mobi.us.org) 
- Zi article on trust: [https://medium.com/new-declaration-to-restore-our-trust/preface-underlying-values-to-reclaiming-a-world-built-on-trust-eae211e061](https://medium.com/new-declaration-to-restore-our-trust/preface-underlying-values-to-reclaiming-a-world-built-on-trust-eae211e061) 
- Patrick - use the fortunate life of access, disconnect working in corporate world, looking at blockchain and web3 and bring forward and connect to web2, not new but better tools to track and enable what people are really doing, a new source of truth, make it apparent that not lying. has been building on the cardano blockchain - making incremental improvements that can have v big impacts down the line.
- April 29 3pm EST 1 hour - How do we want to spend the time together? A
- Danae - looks at building, NY living in "enga building, what does that mean for our Indigenous people, buying back our land, air, water rights - how do you build this - cardano vs solana 
- web3 is making it easier - we have not applied modern tech yet, biggest take - immutable trustable data - getting info that is public record - Patrick's sister is water right lawyers
- Zi - ground in making this relatable to the every day person - maybe everyone does not need to understand web3 but understanding potential outcomes 
	- interesting that talking about decolonized when so new so let's talk about how colonization is showing up 
	- trust is so important - Zi has written extensively - e.g. family trust, land trust - a body that cannot trust its parts - 
- Michael
	- we should start with me sharing how I am approaching this with caution and who I am here for. Next if comfortable, Danae could share her personal story next.

Then Danae and Patrick can share their example of their work

And then we can finish with Zi sharing past experiences and broader systems technical connections/implications for the future

+ a bonus spill over twitter space for when we inevitably go over time lol

Danae
- how to bridge the trustworthy foundations that are having a hard time being tech forward - ==what are most trustworthy institutions in our community ==- leadership and values that are reflective of Indigenous ways of knowing, those that have lived experience in both worlds

Living in Both Worlds - lived experience, not same experience, there are other worlds that exist and drawing those bridges - a full body experience, our system is clogged up, you just can't be to shine in your own unique way - how will people feel with these outcomes. lived experience... how can we build the bridge

people are skeptical - how can we build the bridge - we have no experience with money so why would we go to a place with new money
-love is honest, we sometimes 
in order to build trust we have to tell the truth. we dont do that. there's even questions we dont ask sometimes because we don't want to face the answers

eg LOOKS/opensea - a new playbook

Michael - so much of my work since the pandemci has been about getting low cost computers and internet into the hands of children, youth and families. 

Don't want to overplan the panel, it's going to be what it's going to be..

Patrick - I didn't want to be in financial services but what a change agent it could be. I can trojan horse.... Michelle - impact investing/social finance replicated problematic structures/systems
Will provide honorarium to each speaker $150
Can we record?
Would we do a follow up Twitter conversation
leaders less important, governance has most resilience so that it maintains the votes, purpose -

Decolonizing Web3
Damion Ziere, Heenal Rajani, Tobi Olumurewa, Taryn Lucas, Michelle Baldwin, En, Michael Redhead Champagne
- Heenal - lots of building happening in web 3, and holding space for what wants to emerge, some ideas came up in the session about access and accessibility to web3, research that is already is happening, offer to hold space and what other voices are there and what are people feeling drawn to
- En - at wonderverse.xyz, want to cultiivate a culture of more intersectional materiality lens, class privilege and white population in web3 and impacts liberatory potential of web3 as a tool
- Narrative not being direct enough, what is a more robust toolkit to be onboarded as a more revolutionary lens rather than capitalist lens that is being transported from web2
- people trying to convince rather than empower of different situations and not centering colonization patriarchy - want to reimagine - what does it really mean to care about one another

Zi - to share like minded hearts and spirits, represent work doing at mobi.us, started as a ED and moved to shared leadership model and now all co-directors on team, came out of White House, Obama's social technology team, originally consulting Google, Apple about shifting but the finance department did not want to shift 
-now focused on emergent tech and libertatory tech that captures the collective, care, healers - releasing, embodiement - regenerative investors and those who want to see bridges and pathways to more love and compassion 
-connected to music and has been part of start ups
-not focused on making money, technology being born of the earth
Michael - if language around web3 -  revolution, spirit, liberation, health, love would feel safer here - bridging from the destruction of planet - can't even make a wallet, communities and families are so effected - how to impact those living in poverty - housing is so related to challenge, access to basic things
-longer I am lied to about the issues on mother earth, 
Tobi Olumurewa - 3rd year university, trying to understand web3, potential and possibilities- emancipatory, liberatory framework - because new and lack of accessible info, and difficult to know how ideals can be achieved
Taryn Lucas - 
Book - Blockchain Revolution - [https://dontapscott.com/books/blockchain-revolution/](https://dontapscott.com/books/blockchain-revolution/) 
Of Water and Spirit [https://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/book-reviews/view/7051/of-water-and-the-spirit](https://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/book-reviews/view/7051/of-water-and-the-spirit) 

Taryn - research and fundraising background. Nigerian protests - saw potential of web3.

Danae - has been in blockchain for more than a decade. medical field. now financial engineering - minority-owned banks, local banks. + DEI treasury. trying to empower banks to serve communities. investigating how do we give assets back to indigenous communities? water, air, land rights - purchase them back from the government. idea for crypto bank + cannabis bank.

En - lack of leadership in communities that have been defanged by white supremacy. we are the leaders who are going to take the charge... I don't see other people out there using the power/perspective I have like I am doing. I need to put it out there that I have something to offer and allow the universe to guide me.

Zi - we are the ones we are waiting for. we don't even know our histories - africa, indigenous stories. Someone in Oakland is working to ensure that everyone who lives in the city has an equity/ownership stake in the city. 

love is fire. how do we fight fire with fire? we can learn a lot from dictators... 

what does this look like in practice? how do we infuse the language of love into web3...?

Foundations tend to be very anti-crypto even when indigenous communities they serve want to go in that direction

Danae - compiling stories for ABC

Danae - Very passionate about: How do we build a DAO for indigenous communities to buy back assets?

Surviving is a radical act!
