# DAO Primitives Meeting - **25/4/23**

- Attendees:
- **Review of progress and readiness for:**
	- Governance Docs & CELL doc framewor:[All In For Sport Governance - All In For Sport Documentation](https://docs.allinforsport.org/v/governance/)
		- We will need a code of conduct reasonably soon so that the dispute resolution processes can be built on it. We should work with community experience to develop this in the next few months. 
		- MEETING NOTES - We need to pass a proposal to include a member badge in community governance, and include members in the UNA. This will include a criteria for people becoming members. 
			- Community governance will need to decide who gets to be a contributor by setting the requirements of being a DAO 
			- Perhaps - you wouldn't need to be a member to do something, but you will in order to get permissions to do anything. So you could start by contributing to a cell and then log a contribution in Govern to trigger membership. Other community members (i.e members from the cell) can attest to the contribution (with a minimum of 3 attestations for example. 
			- We could possibly use gitcoin passport to avoid sybal attack in the community governance
