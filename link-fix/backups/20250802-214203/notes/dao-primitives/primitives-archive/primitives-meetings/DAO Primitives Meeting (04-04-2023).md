# DAO Primitives Meeting - **04/04/23**

- Attendees:
	- Rowan, Ananth, rathermercurial
- **Review of progress and readiness for:**
	- **Gov State** initial commit prerequisites:
		- Deploy Ricardian NFT for treasury wallet
		- Setup multisigners (Shanny, Heenal, Rowan)
			- We need some form of agreement / expectations for multisigners
		- Notes
			- The NFT should be in the wallet before the gov state is committed. 
			- Ricardian NFT is now in the AIFS polygon wallet 
	- **Supporting docs**: Incorporating feedback from AIFS weekly
		- Preference for GitBook over Clarity for information resources
		- Events calendar needed - discord may be suitable
		- Current request / publication workflow potentially unsustainable without cross-functional comp or marketplace structure- Alternative: decentralized docs structure + coordination norms for centralized resources
- **Review revenue share model and develop**
- Topics from last week to revisit:
	- **Membership badges** should be updated to new contract, requiring gov state update proposal.- To make this proposal more meaningful, what other to-do's should be included?- Opportunity to decentralize?
		- Add community experience CELL as badge manager(s)?
		- Create membership requirements / "Member" badge?
		- Include Community Guidelines / CoC?
		- CX Cell Feedback needed.
- Topics for next week:
