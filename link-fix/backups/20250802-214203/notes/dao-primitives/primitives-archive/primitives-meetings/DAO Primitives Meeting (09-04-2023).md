		- Key deliverables 
			- Allo front end
			- AIFS community - Cell processes and support 
			- Operational framework 
			- Deliverables to the funder - Ontario Trillium Foundation
				- Possibly create a public-facing set of documentation to show what the primitive framework is and how to use it 
				- This would include reference to partnerships with the likes of Sobol 
		- Question - making sure that SB is doing the key things that contribute to ongoing, repeatable, reusable tooling 
			- AIFS will do more of the things like community engagement, less focused on the repeatable tooling.
