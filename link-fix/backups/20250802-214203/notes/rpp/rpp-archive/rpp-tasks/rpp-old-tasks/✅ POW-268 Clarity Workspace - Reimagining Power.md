Some basic tools for the Reimagining Power project have been set up for contributors to use. This tool selection is not set in stone and can be changed if a different toolset is needed.
## Discord Channel
- Shared comms for the Reimagining Power project are hosted on the [SuperBenefit Discord server](https://discord.gg/XFAYCNNmXj).
- Tasks and projects in this group can be linked to threads within the #reimagining-power channel. This helps to keep workstream-specific conversation organized and easily-navigable.

## Clarity Group
- The clarity group is a private coordination space for Reimagining Power contributors. All members of the SuperBenefit base can join the group.
- [https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/group/POW/](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/group/POW/) 
- ### Task Board
	- [**Group-wide task board**](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/group/POW/tasks)
	- A group-wide task board is available for coordination of the various workstreams within this group. The task board is composed of **Projects** and **Tasks**, and tracks progress toward **Goals**.
	- **Projects** are used to track and document collaborative efforts related to a specific goal or outcome. Projects contain multiple tasks, can be related to a Goal.
	- **Tasks** are individual units of work typically performed by one person, such as creating a piece of content, facilitating a meeting, executing a set of contract calls or something else.
		- Information related to specific work items should be located on their respective task pages. If you create documents or other materials outside of Clarity, please link to them within the task page.
		- Tasks can contain sub-tasks if needed, but these should be used only when absolutely neccesary.
	- **Goals** are used to track progress related to DAO-wide initiatives at SuperBenefit. Cells provide value to SuperBenefit by coordinating with other cells to achieve these collective goals.
- ### Documents
	- **Tag Pages** are used to compile tasks and documents related to particular learning journeys and focus areas. These can be used to record learnings, describe projects or concepts, and help fellow contributors discover relevant information.
		- Tags can be added to any document or task by typing `#`, pressing `Ctrl/Cmd + U`, or using the / key to add a "Tag" block using the context menu. Learn more [here](https://app.clarity.so/wiki/tags/e1bdb0ed-065b-458d-a666-ba1672e2fcdb).
		- The main project tag is [reimagining power](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/reimagining%20power.md). Also included are:
			- [reimagine institute](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/reimagine%20institute.md)
			- [equality fund](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/equality%20fund.md)

			- [ontario trillium foundation](/notes/archive/clarity/Tags/ontario%20trillium%20foundation.md)
	- Group-wide document storage is available for notes and other docs related to the project. These docs are only visible to group members, and are best suited to note taking, reference materials and other miscellaneous information.
