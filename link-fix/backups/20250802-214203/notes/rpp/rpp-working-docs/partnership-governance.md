This pattern is for creating a fractal of a community and operational [governance](/tags/governance.md) (a DAO within a DAO). Creating a functioning [community governance](/notes/rpp/rpp-working-docs/community-governance.md) (stakeholder group) and a Cell-based operational network execute on the goals of the stakeholders.


Use this pattern to design the governance for a partnership between a [DAO](/tags/daos.md) and one or more other organizations where:
	1. The partnership has the intent to work on a specific project
	2. The DAO will coordinate the execution of the project



Example - RPP governance and operational structure.
