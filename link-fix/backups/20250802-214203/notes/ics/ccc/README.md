# Community Exchange Project

Community Exchange is a local economic system that combines relationship-building with resource sharing. It creates a space where people can both connect through their interests and skills while supporting each other through a structured exchange of services and resources.

## Quick Start

- [Project Overview](/ccc.md) - Main project file
- [Latest Documentation](docs/) - Current version
- [Contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) - How to contribute

## What is Community Exchange?

Community Exchange harnesses our community's abundance—our time, skills, knowledge, and resources—creating resilience through mutual support and reciprocity. Unlike conventional economic systems that rely solely on money, this system enables:

- Alternative pathways for value exchange
- Strong community ties through meaningful interaction
- Mobilization of hidden community assets
- Local resilience and interdependence
