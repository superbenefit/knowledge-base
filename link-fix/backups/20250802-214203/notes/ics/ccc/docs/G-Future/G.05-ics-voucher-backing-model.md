# ICS Voucher Backing Model

## Overview

The Institute for Community Sustainability (ICS) demonstrates how organizations can transition from volunteer-based operations to voucher-backed compensation while strengthening the Community Connection & Commitment Commons pool. This model shows how organizations can value volunteer work with partial cash backing.

## The ICS Model

### Basic Structure
- **Volunteer Compensation:** 20 vouchers per Repair Café shift (equivalent to $200 value)
- **Cash Backing:** ICS contributes $100 in cash to back these vouchers
- **Backing Ratio:** 50% cash backing ($5 per voucher issued)

### Economic Mechanics

**Value Creation:**
- Volunteers receive $200 worth of vouchers for their time
- ICS pays $100 to support the pool liquidity
- Pool gains $100 in cash reserves
- Volunteers can spend vouchers on goods/services worth full value

**Win-Win-Win Scenario:**
1. **Volunteers:** Receive compensation for previously unpaid work
2. **ICS:** Supports volunteers while strengthening community resources
3. **Pool:** Gains cash liquidity and increased participation

## Implementation Example

### Repair Café Integration
**Standard Operation:**
- Monthly Repair Café events
- 3-hour shifts per volunteer
- 5-10 volunteers per event

**Voucher Distribution:**
- Each volunteer receives 20 vouchers
- ICS contributes $100 cash per event
- Vouchers immediately spendable in pool

**Cash Flow:**
- ICS monthly contribution: $100-200 (depending on volunteer numbers)
- Pool cash reserves increase
- Enables other organizations to cash out when needed

## Scaling Potential

### Other ICS Programs
- Thing Library support: 5 vouchers per hour
- Workshop facilitation: 30 vouchers per session
- Administrative support: 15 vouchers per hour
- Community advocacy: 20 vouchers per meeting

### Organizational Model Replication
Other nonprofits can adopt similar models:
- Environmental organizations
- Community food programs
- Educational initiatives
- Social services providers

## Financial Projections

### Year 1
- 10 events × $100 = $1,000 cash contribution
- 200 vouchers distributed
- Estimated 50% voucher circulation

### Year 2-3
- Expand to multiple ICS programs
- Potential $3,000-5,000 annual contribution
- Network effect as other orgs join
- Stabilized liquidity model

## Implementation Guidelines

### Structural Requirements
1. **Budget Allocation:** Reserve 5-10% operating budget for voucher backing
2. **Tracking Systems:** Monitor voucher issuance and cash contributions
3. **Value Standards:** Align voucher value with fair market rates
4. **Integration Plan:** Phase in voucher compensation gradually
