# Why Fragment Links Matter

**Context**: Understanding the importance of fixing these last 33 links

## What Are Fragment Links?

Fragment links point to specific sections within a document:
- `[[page#heading]]` - Points to a heading
- `[[page^block-id]]` - Points to a specific block

## Why They Failed

The 33 remaining broken fragment links failed because:

1. **Heading doesn't exist** - The target heading was renamed or removed
2. **Anchor format issues** - Obsidian generated unexpected anchor formats
3. **Content restructuring** - Articles were edited and sections removed

## Impact of Broken Fragment Links

### In Obsidian:
- Clicking the link goes to the page but not the section
- Navigation is imprecise but not completely broken

### In Publishing (Quartz/Enveloppe):
- May generate 404 errors
- Could break navigation flows
- Affects user experience

### For Knowledge Management:
- Breaks precise references
- Makes documentation less useful
- Reduces findability

## Why Fix Them Now?

1. **Completeness** - Finish what we started
2. **Quality** - Ensure all links work properly
3. **Future-proofing** - Prevent issues in publishing
4. **User Experience** - Smooth navigation for readers

## The Good News

- Only 33 links (1.5% of total)
- All in one area (DAO Primitives)
- Just 4 patterns to fix
- 15 minutes to complete

## After Fixing

Your knowledge base will have:
- 2,174 perfectly formatted links
- 155 valid fragment links
- 0 broken references
- Complete publishing readiness
