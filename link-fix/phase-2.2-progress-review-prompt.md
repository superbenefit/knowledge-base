# Prompt to Review Progress and Analyze Phase 3 Readiness

## Project Context

I need a comprehensive review of the link normalization project progress for my SuperBenefit Knowledge Base vault, with special focus on readiness for Phase 3 execution.

**Project Plan Location**: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\link-fix\link-normalization-plan-v2.md` **Vault Location**: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base` (on `plugin-test` branch) **Project Directory**: `/link-fix/`

## Current Status

- **Phase 1**: ✅ COMPLETE (vault analyzed, templates created)
- **Phase 2**: ✅ COMPLETE (strategy documented, tracking system ready)
- **Phase 3**: Ready to begin (pre-processing 28 files)
- **Branch**: Currently on `plugin-test`, will create `plugin-execute` before Phase 3

## Objective

Conduct a thorough review to:

1. **Verify link coverage**: Confirm the plan addresses ALL link types (not just wikilinks and leading slashes)
2. **Check for gaps**: Identify any problematic gaps in the plan or framework
3. **Validate readiness**: Ensure all prerequisites for Phase 3 are met
4. **Risk assessment**: Review any potential issues before execution
5. **Special attention to**:
    - Relative links (../path, ./path)
    - Fragment links (#heading)
    - Mixed format links
    - Edge cases not covered

## Working Style Requirements

Please follow these important working principles:

1. **Systematic review**: Check each component methodically
2. **Critical analysis**: Don't assume everything is correct - verify
3. **Flag concerns**: Clearly identify any issues or risks
4. **Human approval**: Wait for confirmation before making changes
5. **Clear recommendations**: Provide specific actionable items if gaps found
6. **Check actual files**: Don't rely on summaries alone - verify source documents

## Starting Point

Please:

1. Review the complete v2 plan for coverage of all link types
2. Check all Phase 1 and 2 deliverables for completeness
3. Verify T03 template handles all necessary link patterns
4. Analyze if any link types are missing from the conversion strategy
5. Review the inventory data for uncovered edge cases
6. Provide a detailed readiness assessment with any concerns
