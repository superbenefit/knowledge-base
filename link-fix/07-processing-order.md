## Processing Guidelines

### Batch Sizes
- **Small directories** (<20 files): Process entire directory
- **Medium directories** (20-100 files): Process in batches of 20-30
- **Large directories** (>100 files): Process in batches of 50

### Validation Checkpoints
1. After each major directory
2. After every 100 files in large directories
3. Before moving to next phase

### High-Risk Files (>150 links each)
Special attention needed for these files:
- `notes/archive/clarity/Tags/newsletter updates.md` (343 links)
- `links/organizing-handbooks.md` (296 links)
- `notes/general-circle/general-circle.md` (275 links)
- `notes/ics/ccc/archive/archive.md` (224 links)
- `notes/rpp/rpp-archive/rpp-tasks/rpp-tasks.md` (221 links)

### Progress Tracking
- Update CSV tracking files after each batch
- Note any issues in phase-specific issue logs
- Test publishing after each major directory
