### tags/progress.md
- **Pattern**: Nested brackets
- **Count**: 1
- **Examples**: [DAO Primitives Framework](tags/primitives.md), "Progress" is one of three core dimensions of [Group State](artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-state.md) (alongside [Purpose](tags/purpose.md) and [Practice](tags/practices.md))

- **Examples**: ](tags/primitives.md), "Progress" is one of three core dimensions of [Group State](artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-state.md) (alongside [Purpose](tags/purpose.md) and [Practice](tags/practices.md))

### tags/policies.md
- **Pattern**: Nested brackets
- **Count**: 1
- **Examples**: [cell-based organizational models](artifacts/patterns/cell.md), policies operate at multiple scales. Each [Cell](artifacts/patterns/cell.md) maintains internal policies aligned with its specific function, while network-level policies create coherence across the organization. This approach enables both local autonomy and system-wide coordination through a fractal structure of nested agreements. The [state](artifacts/patterns/cell-state.md)

### tags/agents.md
- **Pattern**: Nested brackets
- **Count**: 2
- **Examples**: [autonomy](tags/autonomy.md), capabilities, and authority to act, make [decisions](tags/decisions.md), and affect their environment. Whether human participants, autonomous teams, or computational [systems](tags/systems.md), agents operate based on their incentives, knowledge, and the constraints or [permissions](tags/permissions.md), [DAOs](tags/daos.md) and web3 contexts, agents include core contributors, token holders, community members, and autonomous teams ([Cells](artifacts/patterns/cell.md)) that participate in network governance and operations. These agents interact through transparent [protocols](tags/protocols.md) and operate with varying levels of [autonomy](tags/autonomy.md) while remaining aligned with collective [purpose](tags/purpose.md)
