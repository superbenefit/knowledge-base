# Phase 4 Progress Summary

**Generated**: 2025-08-02 03:10:00  
**Phase 4 Status**: Edge Case Cleanup In Progress

## Summary of Your Session

You've made excellent progress on Phase 4! Here's what you've accomplished:

### 1. Bulk Conversion ‚úÖ
- Successfully used Link Converter plugin on entire `/artifacts/` directory
- Converted ~2,500 wikilinks to markdown format with absolute paths
- All 62 files processed

### 2. Edge Case Discovery üîç
- Identified that Link Converter plugin doesn't handle all edge cases
- Found 55 files still containing 1,583 problematic links
- Main issues: angle brackets, relative paths without leading slash, anchor spaces

### 3. Template Solution üõ†Ô∏è
- Created **T04-Find-Problem-Links** to scan for issues
- Created **T04-Fix-Artifact-Links** to fix edge cases
- Enhanced template to show clear ‚úÖ/‚ö†Ô∏è status at top of results

### 4. High-Impact Processing üìà
- Processed 8 high-priority implementation guide files (~600 issues)
- Confirmed at least 2 files fully cleaned
- Template working successfully for all edge case types

## Current Status

**Progress**: ~40% of edge cases addressed
- Total edge case issues: 1,583
- Processed so far: ~600+ 
- Remaining: ~900-1000

**Files Status**:
- 8 files definitely processed
- 47 files still need attention
- 7 files already clean (no issues)

## Next Steps

1. **Quick Win**: Run T04-Find-Problem-Links again to see updated counts
2. **Continue Processing**: Work through remaining files using the template
3. **Batch Small Files**: Files with <10 issues can be processed quickly
4. **Final Validation**: Once all processed, run final scan to confirm

## Time Estimate

At current pace (~8 files in 30 minutes), remaining files could be completed in:
- **Quick approach**: 1-2 hours (focusing on high-issue files)
- **Thorough approach**: 2-3 hours (processing all files)

Great work on setting up an efficient workflow with the templates! üéâ
