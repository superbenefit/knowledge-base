# Prompt for Phase 3 - Pre-Processing Execution

## Project Context

I need to execute **Phase 3** of the enhanced link normalization project for my SuperBenefit Knowledge Base vault. This phase will prepare files for the main plugin conversion by removing leading slashes and resolving relative paths.

**Critical Project Resources**:
- **Main Plan**: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\link-fix\link-normalization-plan-v2.md`
- **Phase 2.3 Complete**: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\link-fix\66-phase-2-3-complete.md`
- **Pre-Conversion Checklist**: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\link-fix\57-pre-conversion-checklist.md`
- **Quick Reference**: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\link-fix\65-quick-reference-guide.md`
- **Integrated Inventory**: `F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base\link-fix\64-integrated-link-inventory.md`

## Current Status

- **Vault**: F:\projects\sb-knowledge-base (on `plugin-test` branch)
- **Phase 1**: ✅ COMPLETE - Initial inventory and setup
- **Phase 2**: ✅ COMPLETE - Strategy and planning  
- **Phase 2.3**: ✅ COMPLETE - Comprehensive enhancement phase
  - Discovered 12 link patterns (up from 2)
  - Created validation framework
  - Built safety mechanisms
  - Time estimate: 15-20 hours total
- **Phase 3**: Ready to execute

## Phase 2.3 Key Discoveries

From the integrated inventory (file 64):
- **Total Links**: 2,847 across 668 files
- **Link Patterns**: 12 distinct types requiring different handling
- **Pre-Processing Required**:
  - 156 links with leading slashes (T03)
  - 132 relative path links (T08)
  - 289 total files need pre-processing

## Enhanced Templates Available

1. **T03-Remove-Leading-Slashes** - Tested and ready
2. **T08-Resolve-Relative-Paths** - For `../` and `./` patterns
3. **T09-Post-Conversion-Validator** - Comprehensive validation
4. **T10-Conversion-Progress-Validator** - Real-time monitoring
5. **T11-Complete-Vault-Audit** - Health scoring system

## Objective

Execute Phase 3: Pre-Processing with enhanced safety measures

1. Complete pre-conversion checklist (57)
2. Create full backup (T07 or manual)
3. Remove leading slashes using T03
4. Resolve relative paths using T08
5. Validate all pre-processing
6. Update tracking systems

## Working Style Requirements

Follow these proven principles from Phases 1-2.3:

1. **Checklist first**: Complete file 57 pre-conversion checklist
2. **Step-by-step execution**: Work through each step methodically
3. **Human approval**: Always wait for input before file changes
4. **Template usage**: Use templates for ALL file modifications
5. **Dry-run first**: Always test before actual execution
6. **Clear communication**: Explain what will happen before execution
7. **Sequential numbering**: Continue pattern (67 was last)
8. **Progress tracking**: Update CSVs and dashboard continuously
9. **Validation checkpoints**: Run validators after each major step
10. **Rollback ready**: Know the procedures (file 60)

## Pre-Execution Requirements

Before starting, we must complete the **Pre-Conversion Checklist (57)**:

### System Requirements
- [ ] Git status clean
- [ ] Obsidian plugins updated
- [ ] Templates tested
- [ ] No link plugin conflicts

### Backup Verification  
- [ ] Full vault backup created
- [ ] Backup location documented
- [ ] Test restore verified
- [ ] Git pushed to remote

### Risk Assessment
- [ ] High-risk files identified (from file 10)
- [ ] Processing order reviewed (from file 07)
- [ ] Time allocation confirmed (15-20 hours)
- [ ] Team notified

## Starting Point

Please begin with **Phase 3, Step 3.0**: Context Loading

1. First, let's complete the pre-conversion checklist (57)
2. Review these critical files:
   - 62-phase-2-3d-summary.md (validation framework)
   - 64-integrated-link-inventory.md (what we're converting)
   - 65-quick-reference-guide.md (execution reference)
3. Confirm all templates are tested
4. Set up monitoring with T10
5. Guide me through pre-processing workflow

## Time Allocation

Based on Phase 2.3 analysis:
- Pre-processing (Phase 3): 2-3 hours
- Plugin conversion (Phases 4-6): 8-10 hours  
- Validation (Phase 7): 2-3 hours
- Documentation (Phase 8): 2-3 hours
- **Total**: 15-20 hours

## Safety Reminders

- **Backups**: Multiple levels (Git + filesystem + template)
- **Monitoring**: T10 should run during all operations
- **Validation**: T09 after each phase
- **Rollback**: Procedures in file 60 if needed
- **Quick Reference**: Keep file 65 open

Remember: I'll execute the actual commands, you'll guide and track progress. Let's start with the pre-conversion checklist!
