# High-Risk Files Analysis

**Generated**: 2025-08-01  
**Purpose**: Identify and provide handling guidelines for files requiring special care during link conversion

## Risk Categories

### Category A: Extreme Link Density (200+ links)
Files with extremely high link counts that require individual processing and validation.

| `notes/general-circle/general-circle.md` | 275 | Central hub file, critical navigation |
| `notes/ics/ccc/archive/archive.md` | 224 | Archive index, historical content |
| `notes/rpp/rpp-archive/rpp-tasks/rpp-tasks.md` | 221 | Task tracking, operational file |
| `notes/general-circle/old-gc-meetings/old-gc-meetings.md` | 204 | Meeting archive, chronological links |

### Category B: High Link Density (100-199 links)
Files requiring careful batch processing with extra validation.

| File | Links | Risk Factors |
|------|-------|--------------|
| `notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/governance/implementation-guide-operational-governance.md` | 194 | Implementation guide, technical content |
| `artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-facilitation.md` | 193 | Published guide, public-facing |
| `artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/dao-primitives-implemention/implementation-guide-operational-governance.md` | 191 | Published guide, duplicate content |
| `notes/archive/clarity/clarity.md` | 181 | Archive index |
| `notes/dao-primitives/primitives-archive/primitives-docs/2022-04-19 - Weekly Meeting Notes - DAO Primitives.md` | 170 | Meeting notes with extensive links |
| `notes/rpp/rpp-archive/rpp-meetings/rpp-meetings.md` | 160 | Meeting index |
| `artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-primitives/roles.md` | 158 | Published framework doc |
| `notes/dao-primitives/implementation/guides/governance/implementation-guide-multi-stakeholder-governance.md` | 156 | Implementation guide |
| `artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/dao-primitives-implemention/implementation-guide-multi-stakeholder-governance.md` | 154 | Published guide |
| `artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-primitives/tasks.md` | 152 | Published framework doc |
| `artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/group-phase/coordination-phase.md` | 152 | Published framework doc |
| `artifacts/articles/governance-for-better-futures/Governance for better futures - DAO 2 DAO Co-operation.md` | 148 | Published article |
| `artifacts/articles/governance-for-better-futures/governance-for-better-futures.md` | 139 | Published article |
| `artifacts/articles/governance-for-better-futures/Exploring governance for better futures.md` | 139 | Published article |

### Category C: Medium Risk (50-99 links)
Files that can be processed in small batches with standard validation.

- 68 additional files with 50-99 links each
- Includes various notes, artifacts, and documentation
- Standard batch processing applies

### Category D: Template Files
Special handling required regardless of link count.

| Location | Risk Factors |
|----------|--------------|
| `/tools/templates/` | May contain Templater syntax that looks like links |
| `/tools/templates/link-fix-templates/` | Active templates for this project |

## Handling Guidelines

### For Category A Files (200+ links):

1. **Individual Processing**
   - Process one file at a time
   - Create individual backup before processing
   - Monitor system performance

2. **Pre-Processing Checks**
   - Verify file opens correctly
   - Check for any special formatting
   - Note any unusual link patterns

3. **Conversion Process**
   - Use plugin on single file
   - Wait for completion before proceeding
   - Watch for timeout or performance issues

4. **Post-Processing Validation**
   - Verify file still opens
   - Check file size hasn't dramatically changed
   - Test 10-15 random links
   - Verify in preview mode
   - Check graph view still works

5. **Documentation**
   - Log exact time and duration
   - Note any issues or anomalies
   - Record before/after file sizes

### For Category B Files (100-199 links):

1. **Small Batch Processing**
   - Process in batches of 2-3 files max
   - Allow time between batches

2. **Enhanced Validation**
   - Check 5-10 links per file
   - Verify all link types converted correctly

### For Template Files:

1. **Manual Review First**
   - Open each template
   - Identify Templater syntax: `<% %>` blocks
   - Note any special link patterns

2. **Test on Copy**
   - Create copy of template
   - Process copy first
   - Verify functionality preserved

3. **Special Considerations**
   - Templater variables may look like broken links
   - Some syntax should NOT be converted
   - Test template execution after conversion

## Pre-Processing Preparation

### Files with Leading Slashes
From the 28 files requiring pre-processing, these high-risk files need special attention:

| File | Total Links | Leading Slash Links |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `artifacts/studies/experiments/aifs-experiment-case-study.md` | 43 | 43 |
| `artifacts/guides/dao-primitives-framework/dao-primitives-framework.md` | 38 | 38 |

These should be processed with T03 template carefully, with individual validation.

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **System Preparation**
   - Close unnecessary applications
   - Ensure adequate free memory
   - Have Task Manager/Activity Monitor ready

2. **Backup Strategy**
   - Git commit before each high-risk batch
   - T03 template creates automatic backups
   - Consider additional manual backups for Category A

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Watch for UI freezing
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Be prepared to force-quit if needed

4. **Recovery Plans**
   - Know how to restore from Git
   - Keep backup location documented
   - Have rollback scripts ready

---

## Processing Order Recommendation

1. Start with Category C (medium risk) to build confidence
2. Move to Category B with enhanced validation
3. Process Category A files individually with full protocol
4. Handle template files last with special care
