## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Copy the Prompt
Open this file and copy everything between the lines:
ðŸ‘‰ **[96-final-copy-paste-prompt.md](obsidian://open?vault=sb-knowledge-base&file=link-fix%2F96-final-copy-paste-prompt)**

### Step 2: Start New Claude Chat
1. Open a new Claude Sonnet 3.5 chat
2. Ensure it has filesystem MCP access enabled
3. Paste the prompt
4. Send it

### Step 3: Wait for Completion
Claude will:
- Edit 7 files
- Make 33 fixes
- Report progress

### Step 4: Validate Success
After Claude finishes:
1. Copy `T13-Fragment-Link-Validator.md` to `/link-fix/`
2. Execute with Templater
3. Confirm: 0 invalid fragment links

## Time Estimate
