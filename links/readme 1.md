# Web3 Library - Working Draft

This directory contains draft entries for the SuperBenefit Web3 Library. Unlike the polished content in `/links/`, these entries are still being reviewed for format, content quality, and metadata consistency.

## Purpose

The draft library entries serve several purposes:

1. **Team Review**: Allow for collaborative review before public release
2. **Format Testing**: Ensure consistent structure and formatting across entries
3. **Content Development**: Refine descriptions and analyses to maximize value
4. **Metadata Standardization**: Verify tags and other metadata for consistency with the knowledge base

## Contributing

To contribute to the Web3 Library:

1. **Review existing entries** to understand format and expectations
2. **Follow the templates** in the [prompts directory](/notes/prompts/)
3. **Create new entries** for resources you believe should be included
4. **Submit for review** via pull request or other team processes

See the [contributing guidelines](links/contributing.md) for detailed instructions.

## Moving to Production

Once entries have been reviewed and approved, they will be moved to the main `/links` directory for public access. This two-step process ensures quality and consistency across the library.
