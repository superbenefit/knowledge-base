Stanford Social Innovation Review's critical analysis examines how "for good" rhetoric in Web3 can function as cover for extraction and [power](tags/power.md) concentration rather than genuine social benefit. As blockchain projects increasingly claim [impact](tags/impact.md) missions, SSIR explores how progressive language about empowerment, decentralization, and [community](tags/community.md) benefit can obscure who actually profits and whose interests systems serve. The piece provides framework for distinguishing projects genuinely redistributing power from those using social impact branding to legitimize wealth extraction, showing how to evaluate whether Web3 initiatives serve stated communities or primarily enrich founders and investors deploying progressive rhetoric for marketing purposes.

### Key Highlights

- **For Good as Marketing**: SSIR examines how "for good" framing functions as legitimacy strategy enabling blockchain projects to attract impact-oriented participants and funders while maintaining extractive structures that concentrate wealth among early adopters and developers.

- **Power Analysis Framework**: The article provides tools for examining who actually benefits from "Web3 for good" projects—whose wealth increases, who makes decisions, whose labor is extracted, whose communities are impacted—revealing how power often concentrates despite decentralization rhetoric.

- **Impact Washing**: SSIR distinguishes genuine social benefit from impact washing where projects claim community empowerment while extracting value through token appreciation, transaction fees, or platform control that flows toward investors rather than served populations.

- **Community Versus Capital**: The analysis explores tension between serving community needs and providing investor returns, showing how projects claiming both often prioritize capital appreciation while using community benefit language to attract users whose activity generates value captured by token holders.

- **Evaluation Criteria**: SSIR offers specific questions for assessing whether Web3 projects genuinely serve impact goals—who controls [governance](tags/governance.md), how value distributes, whose problems are solved, what alternatives exist—enabling critical evaluation beyond self-descriptions.

- **Structural Not Individual**: The critique focuses on systemic dynamics rather than individual bad actors, showing how even well-intentioned projects can reproduce extraction when structural incentives reward wealth concentration over community benefit.

### Practical Applications

This framework enables critical Web3 evaluation:

- Impact organizations can use SSIR's power analysis when evaluating Web3 partnerships, examining who benefits from proposed collaborations rather than accepting "for good" rhetoric without scrutinizing actual power and value distribution

- Funders can apply evaluation criteria when assessing blockchain social impact projects, distinguishing initiatives genuinely serving communities from those using progressive branding to attract resources while maintaining extractive structures

- Researchers can study how "for good" rhetoric functions in Web3, documenting patterns where community benefit claims obscure extraction rather than assuming stated missions reflect actual outcomes

- Community organizers can demand transparency about governance and value distribution when approached by Web3 projects claiming alignment, ensuring that partnerships genuinely serve community interests rather than extracting toward investors

- Policy advocates can reference SSIR's analysis when arguing for regulations preventing impact washing, showing how "for good" language can obscure extraction requiring scrutiny of actual power dynamics and financial flows

### Connection With SuperBenefit

- SSIR's critique of "for good" as legitimacy strategy challenges SuperBenefit to continuously examine whether [coordination](tags/coordination.md) primitives genuinely redistribute power or use progressive language to obscure concentration—demonstrating that power-aware analysis requires scrutinizing actual governance and value distribution rather than accepting stated commitments to regeneration without verifying implementation.

- The framework for distinguishing genuine impact from washing provides tools for SuperBenefit to evaluate DAO mechanisms rigorously, asking whose wealth increases, who controls decisions, and whose labor is extracted rather than assuming decentralization automatically produces equitable outcomes—showing that effective assessment requires analyzing structural incentives alongside stated values.

- SSIR's emphasis on structural dynamics over individual intentions resonates with SuperBenefit's understanding that regenerative coordination requires designing systems where incentives align with collective benefit rather than relying on good intentions within extractive structures—validating the conviction that genuine transformation demands changing structural dynamics, not just rhetoric or participant virtue.
