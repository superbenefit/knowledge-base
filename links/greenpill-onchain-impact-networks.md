GreenPill's onchain [impact](tags/impact.md) networks [framework](tags/frameworks.md) articulates how [blockchain](tags/blockchain.md) [coordination](tags/coordination.md) can serve ecological and social [regeneration](tags/regeneration.md) through [networks](tags/networks.md) that measure, verify, and reward positive externalities. Traditional economics treats environmental restoration and [community](tags/community.md) benefit as "externalities" outside market calculation, systematically undervaluing [regenerative](tags/regeneration.md) work while rewarding extraction. The [framework](tags/frameworks.md) shows how onchain systems can make [impact](tags/impact.md) measurable and rewardable—creating incentives aligned with [regeneration](tags/regeneration.md) rather than extraction. Rather than assuming markets will address environmental and social harm, GreenPill demonstrates how to build [coordination](tags/coordination.md) infrastructure that explicitly values and funds work creating ecological and [community](tags/community.md) benefit, using [blockchain](tags/blockchain.md) mechanisms to coordinate action across organizations and geographies.

### Key Highlights

- **Positive Externalities Valued**: The framework addresses how conventional economics ignores positive externalities—environmental restoration, community building, knowledge sharing—showing how onchain systems can measure and reward work that benefits broader ecosystems beyond those who directly fund it.

- **Impact Measurement Infrastructure**: GreenPill explores frameworks for measuring ecological and social impact in ways that can be verified onchain, enabling communities to create shared standards for what counts as regenerative contribution worthy of reward.

- **Network Coordination**: Rather than isolated projects, the framework envisions networks of organizations coordinating regenerative action through shared infrastructure for impact verification, funding allocation, and knowledge exchange—creating ecosystem rather than individual initiatives.

- **Incentive Alignment**: The work demonstrates how to align individual and organizational incentives with collective ecological and social benefit, using funding mechanisms that reward demonstrated impact rather than extractive profit or speculative promises.

- **Commons Infrastructure**: GreenPill positions onchain impact networks as public infrastructure serving regenerative coordination, showing how blockchain systems can function as commons enabling collective action rather than privatized platforms extracting value from user networks.

- **Practical Implementation**: Beyond theory, the framework documents actual implementations and provides tools for communities to build impact networks, grounding aspirations in working examples of onchain regenerative coordination.

### Practical Applications

This framework enables onchain regenerative coordination:

- Ecological restoration projects can use GreenPill's infrastructure to coordinate funding and verify [impact](tags/impact.md), creating [networks](tags/networks.md) that reward biodiversity enhancement or carbon sequestration with onchain certificates [communities](tags/community.md) can value and exchange

- [Community](tags/community.md) benefit organizations can implement [impact](tags/impact.md) measurement [frameworks](tags/frameworks.md) showing how their work creates value beyond immediate beneficiaries, enabling funding from [impact](tags/impact.md) [networks](tags/networks.md) rather than relying only on philanthropy or extractive revenue

- [Regenerative](tags/regeneration.md) agriculture [networks](tags/networks.md) can coordinate through onchain systems that verify and reward soil health, water quality, and ecosystem benefit—creating incentives for farming practices that generate positive externalities conventional markets ignore

- [Impact](tags/impact.md) funders can reference the [framework](tags/frameworks.md) when designing allocation mechanisms that reward demonstrated ecological and social benefit rather than speculative promises or narrow financial returns

- [Protocol](tags/protocols.md) designers can apply GreenPill's principles when building [blockchain](tags/blockchain.md) systems, ensuring [coordination](tags/coordination.md) infrastructure serves [regenerative](tags/regeneration.md) goals rather than optimizing for transaction volume or token appreciation

### Connection With SuperBenefit

- GreenPill's [framework](tags/frameworks.md) for making positive externalities measurable and rewardable validates SuperBenefit's [regenerative](tags/regeneration.md) economics emphasis, showing how [coordination](tags/coordination.md) [primitives](tags/primitives.md) can explicitly value ecological and social benefit that conventional systems treat as unmeasurable externalities—demonstrating that [blockchain](tags/blockchain.md) mechanisms should enable [communities](tags/community.md) to define and reward [impact](tags/impact.md) beyond financial metrics.

- The emphasis on [network](tags/networks.md) [coordination](tags/coordination.md) rather than isolated projects resonates with SuperBenefit's understanding that effective [regeneration](tags/regeneration.md) requires [ecosystems](tags/ecosystems.md) of aligned organizations rather than individual initiatives—suggesting that [coordination](tags/coordination.md) tools should facilitate knowledge exchange, shared standards, and collective funding rather than only enabling single-organization [governance](tags/governance.md).

- GreenPill's positioning of onchain systems as public infrastructure for [regenerative](tags/regeneration.md) [coordination](tags/coordination.md) aligns with SuperBenefit's [commons](tags/commons.md)-oriented approach, showing that [blockchain](tags/blockchain.md) mechanisms should function as shared resources enabling collective action rather than privatized platforms extracting value through [protocol](tags/protocols.md) fees or token appreciation controlled by early adopters.
