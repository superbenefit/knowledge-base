This peer-reviewed academic article provides rigorous critical analysis of how Web3 technologies embody competing logics: expansive networks that genuinely distribute power and enable collective capacity, versus extractive networks that concentrate wealth and control through new mechanisms while claiming decentralization. Published in a leading interdisciplinary journal, the work applies political economy frameworks and power analysis to examine whether and how blockchain systems challenge or reproduce hierarchies. Rather than celebratory or dismissive, the analysis offers nuanced tools for distinguishing genuinely transformative decentralized approaches from those that merely transfer extraction to new elites—essential reading for anyone seeking to build or evaluate regenerative Web3 systems.

### Key Highlights

- **Expansive vs. Extractive Framework**: The article introduces analytical distinction between expansive networks (that enhance collective capacity, distribute decision-making power, and enable broad participation) and extractive networks (that concentrate value, limit governance access, and serve elite accumulation). This framework enables evaluating specific protocols rather than treating "Web3" as monolithic.

- **Power Concentration Through Code**: The work examines how technical design choices—token distribution, governance mechanisms, protocol fees—concentrate or distribute power, showing that dec

entralization claims require scrutiny of actual power dynamics rather than accepting self-descriptions at face value.

- **Token Plutocracy Analysis**: The article provides detailed critique of token-weighted governance, showing how this common Web3 pattern reproduces plutocracy (rule by the wealthy) despite decentralization rhetoric. The analysis demonstrates why one-token-one-vote systems advantage capital holders over diverse community participants.

- **New Forms of Enclosure**: Drawing on commons theory, the work analyzes how Web3 platforms can enclose previously open resources through protocol control, fee extraction, and proprietary layers—creating new commons enclosures that concentrate benefits while distributing risks.

- **Labor and Value Extraction**: The article examines how decentralized platforms extract value from unpaid community labor (governance participation, content creation, protocol improvement) while directing financial gains to token holders and founders—revealing continuities with platform capitalism's exploitation patterns.

- **Legitimacy Through Decentralization Discourse**: The work critically analyzes how "decentralization" functions rhetorically to legitimize systems that may not meaningfully distribute power, showing how the language of democracy can obscure plutocratic realities.

- **Alternatives and Possibilities**: Unlike purely critical accounts, the article identifies design patterns that could enable genuinely expansive networks: quadratic voting, reputation-based governance, progressive fee structures, commons stewardship frameworks—showing that alternative approaches exist even if less common than extractive patterns.

### Practical Applications

This analytical framework enables critical evaluation across Web3 contexts:

- DAO designers can use the expansive/extractive framework as evaluation criteria during governance design, asking whether proposed mechanisms genuinely distribute decision-making power or concentrate it among token whales and founders despite participation theater

- Protocol developers can apply the power concentration analysis to tokenomics and fee structures, designing mechanisms that direct value toward broad participants and ecosystem health rather than extracting toward early investors and platforms

- Community participants can use the labor extraction critique to recognize and challenge dynamics where their governance work, content creation, or protocol improvements benefit token holders disproportionately—demanding compensation or governance changes

- Funders and impact investors can employ the framework when evaluating whether Web3 projects serve collective benefit or individual accumulation, looking beyond decentralization claims to analyze actual power distributions

- Researchers and critics can build on the article's methodology to examine emerging protocols, documenting patterns of extraction and expansion to develop evidence base for which approaches genuinely distribute power

- Policy advocates can reference the academic analysis when arguing for regulation that addresses power concentration in decentralized systems, showing that technical decentralization doesn't automatically produce democratic outcomes

- Social movement organizations can use the commons enclosure analysis to recognize and resist when Web3 projects enclose previously shared resources through protocol control

The rigorous scholarly approach provides credibility when challenging dominant Web3 narratives or advocating for alternative approaches.

### Connection With SuperBenefit

- **Power-Aware Protocol Design**: The article's detailed power analysis directly supports SuperBenefit's commitment to power-aware approaches, providing analytical tools for distinguishing genuinely regenerative coordination from extraction disguised as decentralization.

- **Beyond Token Plutocracy**: The critique of token-weighted governance informs SuperBenefit's exploration of alternative mechanisms (quadratic voting, reputation systems, participation-based rights) that distribute power beyond capital ownership.

- **Labor and Value Distribution**: The analysis of value extraction from community labor supports SuperBenefit's work on rewarding diverse forms of contribution rather than directing gains primarily toward token holders.

- **Commons Protection**: The enclosure critique helps SuperBenefit recognize and resist when coordination tools risk enclosing shared resources, informing commitment to commons stewardship rather than protocol ownership.

- **Expansive Network Goals**: The expansive networks framework provides language for SuperBenefit's aspirations—building coordination systems that genuinely enhance collective capacity rather than merely changing who extracts value.

- **Critical Evaluation Tools**: The article's methodology offers SuperBenefit practical tools for evaluating whether specific Web3 projects align with regenerative values or reproduce extraction, enabling more rigorous partner assessment and design choices.
