Noema's powerful essay applies ecological rewilding principles to internet infrastructure, showing how current platform monoculture mirrors agricultural monocultures vulnerable to collapse. Just as industrial farming creates fragile ecosystems dependent on chemical inputs, platform monopolies create brittle internet infrastructure where single points of failure threaten entire digital ecosystems. Rewilding requires restoring biodiversity—multiple protocols, federated platforms, interoperable services—creating resilient internet ecosystems that can withstand disruption. The essay shows how [decentralization](tags/decentralization.md), commons [governance](tags/governance.md), and protocol diversity constitute digital rewilding, offering regenerative alternative to extractive platform capitalism that concentrates power while creating systemic fragility.

### Key Highlights

- **Monoculture Vulnerability**: The article demonstrates how platform consolidation creates systemic fragility similar to agricultural monocultures—when single platforms dominate, failures cascade across entire digital ecosystems lacking redundancy.

- **Ecological Restoration Metaphor**: Rewilding frames internet transformation as ecological restoration requiring biodiversity and resilience rather than merely different ownership of existing monopolistic structures.

- **Decentralization as Biodiversity**: The essay positions protocol diversity and federated platforms as digital biodiversity creating resilient ecosystems, contrasting with monoculture platform consolidation that maximizes short-term efficiency while creating long-term vulnerability.

- **Commons Governance**: Noema connects rewilding with commons-based [governance](tags/governance.md), showing how participatory stewardship of internet infrastructure creates healthier ecosystems than proprietary platform control.

- **Regenerative Infrastructure**: The article articulates vision for regenerative internet that sustains itself and communities rather than extracting toward platform owners, drawing parallels with regenerative agriculture versus industrial farming.

- **Systems Transformation**: Rewilding requires systemic change not just incremental reform—building alternative infrastructure, changing incentive structures, redistributing power—similar to ecosystem restoration requiring fundamental shifts rather than pesticide substitution.

### Practical Applications

This framework enables regenerative internet development:

- Protocol developers can adopt rewilding principles when designing infrastructure, prioritizing interoperability and federation over proprietary lock-in even when consolidation offers short-term advantages

- Platform cooperatives can use ecological metaphor when articulating alternatives to monopolies, showing how diverse federated networks create resilience that centralized platforms cannot match despite greater individual scale

- Policy advocates can draw on rewilding framework when arguing for antitrust enforcement or regulation supporting interoperability, making case for biodiversity over monoculture in terms of ecosystem health rather than only competition

- Community organizers can reference rewilding when building alternatives to extractive platforms, understanding [decentralization](tags/decentralization.md) as restoring healthy ecosystems rather than merely fragmenting existing monopolies

- Researchers can explore how ecological principles apply to digital systems, studying whether protocol diversity and federation create measurably more resilient internet infrastructure

### Connection With SuperBenefit

- Noema's rewilding metaphor provides powerful framework for SuperBenefit's regenerative approach, showing that genuinely transformative [coordination](tags/coordination.md) infrastructure requires ecosystem biodiversity rather than monopolistic platforms—suggesting that DAO primitives should prioritize interoperability and federation over proprietary lock-in, creating resilient [coordination](tags/coordination.md) ecosystems not single-platform dominance.

- The article's emphasis on systemic transformation resonates with SuperBenefit's understanding that genuine alternatives require fundamental restructuring not incremental platform reform—validating that regenerative [coordination](tags/coordination.md) demands building parallel infrastructure and changing incentive structures, not just redistributing ownership of extractive systems.

- Rewilding's restoration of commons [governance](tags/governance.md) validates SuperBenefit's conviction that healthy internet requires participatory stewardship rather than corporate or state control alone—showing that [coordination](tags/coordination.md) primitives should enable collective stewardship of shared infrastructure, creating digital commons that communities govern together.
