Welcome to the Web3 Library! This section contains a curated collection of external resources that inform and enrich our work on decentralized organizations (DAOs), Web3 governance, and social impact initiatives.

Think of this as our collection of neighboring gardens. We document external resources that inform our work, adding our own analysis and interpretation. This helps us understand how our work connects to and builds upon the broader knowledge commons.

## What You'll Find Here

This library includes:

*   **Referenced Articles and Papers:** Links to academic papers, research reports, and news articles that provide valuable insights into relevant topics.
*   **Commentary and Analysis:** Our community's commentary and analysis on these external resources, providing context and highlighting key takeaways.
*   **Relevant External Projects:** Links to external projects, initiatives, and organizations that are working in similar areas.
*   **Connected Ideas and Insights:** Connections to related ideas and insights within our own knowledge base, helping you explore the relationships between external resources and our internal thinking.

## How to Use This Section

Browse through the categories below to find resources relevant to your interests or needs. Each link is accompanied by a brief description and, in many cases, commentary from our community.

Use the tags and links to explore related concepts and ideas. The goal is to provide a curated and contextualized collection of external resources that can help you deepen your understanding of DAOs, Web3 governance, and social impact.
