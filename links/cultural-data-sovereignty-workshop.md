This workshop report documents a groundbreaking collaboration between 221A artist-run centre and Hypha Worker Cooperative, supported by TechSoup and the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web. The two-part Cultural Data Sovereignty workshop brought together artists, archivists, cultural organizations, developers, and technologists to explore how decentralized technologies can enable cultural institutions to build agency over their digital asset collections. The initiative emerged from urgent concerns about AI development treating cultural data as "raw material to be extracted rather than a shared heritage to be collectively governed," offering practical pathways toward community stewardship of cultural memory.

### Key Highlights
- **Critical Analysis of AI Extraction**: The workshop framed current AI development as fundamentally extractive, concentrating power in the hands of a few companies while excluding cultural producers from value generated by their creations. This analysis provides a clear alternative to treating cultural data as neutral input for machine learning systems.
- **FAIR Data Implementation**: Participants learned to build technical and governance infrastructure ensuring cultural data is Findable through proper attribution, Accessible through democratic governance, Interoperable through open protocols, and Reusable through ethical licensing frameworksâ€”transforming abstract principles into concrete institutional practices.
- **Adoption Gap as Knowledge Gap**: Research revealed that while 55% of cultural organizations rely on private cloud storage providers like Google and Microsoft, only 3.2% use any form of decentralized technology. The workshop positioned this not as resistance to change but as lack of accessible pathways to exercise control over digital assets.
- **Cross-Sector Bridge Building**: The initiative demonstrated how artist-run centres, archives, libraries, museums, and technology cooperatives can collaborate on shared infrastructure rather than each organization solving data sovereignty challenges in isolation.
- **Practical Governance Frameworks**: Rather than focusing solely on technical solutions, the workshop emphasized governance structures that enable democratic decision-making about cultural collections, showing how technological choices reflect and enable different power relationships.
- **Cultural Memory Lab Pathway**: The workshop connected participants to concrete funding opportunities, with eligible attendees able to apply for up to $5,000 USD through the Cultural Memory Lab microgranting program, providing both resources and technical support for implementing decentralized approaches to cultural preservation.

### Practical Applications

This workshop model can be applied across multiple contexts:

- Cultural institutions seeking alternatives to extractive cloud storage can use the FAIR data framework to evaluate and implement decentralized storage solutions while maintaining democratic governance over their collections
- Artist-run centres and community archives can leverage the collaborative model between cultural organizations and worker cooperatives to build shared technical infrastructure rather than individual solutions
- Museums and galleries can apply the workshop's findings about the knowledge gap to develop staff capacity around data sovereignty, moving beyond simple tool adoption to understanding the governance implications of different technological choices
- Technology cooperatives and developers can use this model for engaging with cultural sector clients, emphasizing stewardship principles rather than efficiency or cost savings alone
- Funding organizations can reference the Cultural Memory Lab approach to design grant programs that connect resources with technical support, addressing both financial and knowledge barriers to implementing alternative technologies

The workshop provides a replicable model for building bridges between cultural preservation and technological sovereignty, offering concrete steps for institutions ready to move beyond corporate platforms.

### Connection With SuperBenefit

- Demonstrates practical application of community stewardship principles by showing how cultural institutions can exercise collective governance over digital assets rather than ceding control to extractive platforms.
- Aligns with SuperBenefit's regenerative economics approach by framing cultural data as shared heritage requiring democratic stewardship rather than individual or corporate ownership.
- Exemplifies the pattern of building bridges between sectors (arts/culture and technology) to create shared infrastructure that serves community rather than corporate interests.
- Connects to Ethereum Localism values by emphasizing local cultural preservation and community-controlled technological solutions over centralized platforms.
