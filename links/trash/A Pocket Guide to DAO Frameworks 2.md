The article "A Pocket Guide to DAO Frameworks" highlights key DAO platforms, including [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/), [Moloch](https://molochdao.com/), and [Aragon](https://aragon.org/), explaining how they enable decentralized, autonomous governance. Each framework offers different features: OpenZeppelin for modular governance, Moloch for minimal DAOs, and Aragon for optimistic governance structures. It serves as a resource for those interested in launching or managing decentralized organizations.

## Summary 

Here is a summary of the article, "A Pocket Guide to DAO Frameworks," along with as many links as possible to the DAO frameworks mentioned:

### Introduction

The article introduces DAO #frameworks as structured systems designed to enable decentralized governance and collaboration within organizations. These frameworks facilitate autonomous, on-chain decision-making processes in decentralized communities. Learn more about DAOs from resources like [Ethereum's DAO overview](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/).

### [OpenZeppelin Governor](https://www.openzeppelin.com/)

OpenZeppelin Governor is a modular system for on-chain governance, developed in collaboration with [Compound](https://compound.finance/). It allows secure and reusable smart contracts for decentralized decision-making. It’s widely used to create DAOs that value flexibility and security.

### [Moloch](https://molochdao.com/)

Moloch is a "minimum viable DAO framework" initially focused on grant funding. It features the unique "Ragequit" mechanism, which enables members to leave the DAO and withdraw their proportional share of the treasury if they disagree with decisions made by the community.

### [Aragon](https://aragon.org/)

Aragon is a comprehensive platform for building and managing DAOs. Its "Optimistic Governance" model speeds up decision-making by assuming that proposals pass unless challenged, making governance more streamlined. Aragon also provides tools for creating custom DAOs with governance tokens.

### Other DAO Frameworks

The article also briefly touches on additional frameworks like [Colony](https://colony.io/), which focuses on reputation-based governance, [Tribute](https://tribute.co/), and [OpenLaw](https://www.openlaw.io/), which integrates legal contracts into DAOs. These platforms emphasize different aspects of decentralized governance, showing the diversity in the DAO ecosystem.
