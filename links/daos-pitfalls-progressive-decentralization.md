This Gardens analysis provides critical examination of "progressive [decentralization](tags/decentralization.md)"—the common pattern where [DAOs](tags/daos.md) launch with centralized founder control, promising to gradually distribute [power](tags/power.md) over time. While presented as pragmatic path from startup to true [decentralization](tags/decentralization.md), the article reveals how this approach often becomes permanent excuse for maintaining founder privilege while claiming [DAO](tags/daos.md) status. Gardens explores how progressive [decentralization](tags/decentralization.md) rhetoric lets founders retain control while enjoying [DAO](tags/daos.md) branding benefits, how promised timelines slip indefinitely, and how early [power](tags/power.md) concentration creates structural barriers to genuine redistribution. The critique doesn't argue all [DAOs](tags/daos.md) must launch fully [decentralized](tags/decentralization.md), but demands honesty about [power](tags/power.md) dynamics and concrete mechanisms ensuring promised transitions actually occur rather than progressive [decentralization](tags/decentralization.md) becoming permanent centralization with decentralized aesthetics.

### Key Highlights

- **Progressive Decentralization as Excuse**: The analysis shows how "we're progressively [decentralizing](tags/decentralization.md)" functions as indefinite deferral of actual [power](tags/power.md) redistribution, allowing founders to maintain control while claiming [DAO](tags/daos.md) legitimacy. Promised timelines repeatedly extend while concrete transfer mechanisms remain vague.

- **Structural Lock-In**: Gardens examines how early centralization creates path dependencies making later [decentralization](tags/decentralization.md) difficult—founders accumulate tokens, control key infrastructure, shape culture and norms, and build institutional knowledge that becomes practically irreplaceable even if formally [power](tags/power.md) could transfer.

- **Governance Theater**: The piece identifies pattern where [DAOs](tags/daos.md) create participation appearance through votes on minor [decisions](tags/decisions.md) while founders retain control over fundamental choices, giving [community](tags/community.md) sense of voice without actual [power](tags/power.md) redistribution that would threaten founder interests.

- **Concrete Transition Mechanisms**: Rather than rejecting staged approaches entirely, Gardens argues for binding commitments with specific triggers, timelines, and verification—showing difference between genuine transition plans and vague promises used to delay [power](tags/power.md)-sharing indefinitely.

- **Who Benefits**: The analysis asks whose interests progressive [decentralization](tags/decentralization.md) serves, revealing how founders enjoy both startup agility and [DAO](tags/daos.md) [community](tags/community.md) benefits without accountability constraints of either traditional incorporation or genuine distributed [governance](tags/governance.md).

### Practical Applications

This critique enables more honest DAO governance evaluation:

- [DAO](tags/daos.md) participants can use Gardens' [framework](tags/frameworks.md) to evaluate whether "progressive [decentralization](tags/decentralization.md)" represents genuine transition plan or indefinite deferral, demanding concrete timelines, triggers, and mechanisms rather than accepting vague promises

- Founders can apply the analysis when designing launch [governance](tags/governance.md), creating binding commitments to [power](tags/power.md) redistribution with verification mechanisms rather than assuming good intentions suffice for eventual [decentralization](tags/decentralization.md)

- [Governance](tags/governance.md) designers can build staged [decentralization](tags/decentralization.md) with enforceable transitions—using smart contracts that automatically transfer control at specified milestones rather than relying on founders voluntarily relinquishing [power](tags/power.md)

- [Communities](tags/community.md) can demand transparency about current [power](tags/power.md) distribution alongside future promises, understanding who actually controls [decisions](tags/decisions.md) versus who participates in [governance](tags/governance.md) theater around marginal choices

- Researchers can study which progressive [decentralization](tags/decentralization.md) attempts genuinely redistribute [power](tags/power.md) versus which become permanent centralization, identifying structural factors enabling or preventing promised transitions

### Connection With SuperBenefit

- Gardens' critique of progressive [decentralization](tags/decentralization.md) as excuse for founder control challenges SuperBenefit to examine how [DAO](tags/daos.md) [primitives](tags/primitives.md) can create enforceable [power](tags/power.md) redistribution rather than merely enabling promises that founders can indefinitely defer—suggesting that [coordination](tags/coordination.md) tools should include mechanisms ensuring transitions actually occur if genuine [decentralization](tags/decentralization.md) is goal.

- The analysis of [governance](tags/governance.md) theater—participation in marginal [decisions](tags/decisions.md) while founders retain fundamental control—resonates with SuperBenefit's understanding that meaningful [governance](tags/governance.md) requires distributing [power](tags/power.md) over consequential choices, not just creating appearance of participation through votes on implementation details.

- Gardens' demand for concrete transition mechanisms validates SuperBenefit's emphasis on [power](tags/power.md)-aware design, showing that genuine [decentralization](tags/decentralization.md) requires intentional structures preventing [power](tags/power.md) concentration rather than assuming founders will voluntarily redistribute control once projects succeed and they've accumulated tokens, knowledge, and institutional position that would be sacrificed through actual power-sharing.
