This workshop represents a practical convergence of regenerative finance principles, impact measurement frameworks, and innovative funding mechanisms. Hosted by ReFi DAO Global, the session brought together ReFi projects, local nodes, GreenPill chapters, and impact-driven builders to explore how structured impact reporting can enhance funding opportunities while advancing regenerative finance ecosystems. The workshop focused on implementing the Common Approach framework for impact measurement, demonstrating updates to Karma GAP reporting tools, and preparing participants for the GG23 Regen Coordination RetroQF round—showcasing how alternative economics can move from theory to practice through coordinated infrastructure.

### Key Highlights
- **Common Approach Framework Implementation**: The workshop demonstrated how the Common Approach enables ReFi projects to systematically track and communicate their regenerative impact, providing standardized frameworks that make impact comparable across different projects and contexts while maintaining flexibility for diverse regenerative approaches.
- **Karma GAP Evolution for Impact Reporting**: Participants learned about new features in Karma GAP designed to support Activity & Output reporting for impact-based funding, showing how reporting tools can evolve to serve decentralized funding mechanisms rather than traditional grant requirements.
- **RetroQF Integration with Impact Scores**: The session explored how the GG23 Regen Coordination RetroQF round evaluates projects using Karma GAP data, with Impact Scores influencing quadratic funding matching—demonstrating practical integration between impact measurement and alternative funding mechanisms.
- **Cross-Ecosystem Coordination**: By bringing together ReFi DAO Local Nodes, GreenPill chapters, and independent projects, the workshop modeled how regenerative finance ecosystems can coordinate across organizational boundaries while maintaining autonomous local implementation.
- **Decentralized Funding Preparation**: Rather than treating funding as a separate activity, the workshop showed how projects can embed impact measurement into their operations, making funding applications an extension of ongoing regenerative work rather than additional administrative burden.
- **Practical Bridge Between Values and Mechanisms**: The workshop demonstrated how regenerative values can be operationalized through specific coordination frameworks, moving beyond aspirational statements to concrete practices that enable resource allocation aligned with regenerative principles.

### Practical Applications

This workshop model and its frameworks can be applied across multiple regenerative contexts:

- Regenerative finance projects can implement the Common Approach framework to systematically document their impact while building capacity for accessing impact-aligned funding opportunities through RetroQF and similar mechanisms
- Local bioregional organizations can adapt the coordination model demonstrated by ReFi DAO nodes to build shared infrastructure for impact measurement and resource coordination without sacrificing local autonomy
- Alternative economics initiatives can use the Karma GAP reporting approach to track outcomes and build evidence for the effectiveness of their approaches, creating data that supports broader adoption of regenerative economic models
- Funding organizations exploring beyond traditional grants can learn from the RetroQF implementation to design funding mechanisms that reward demonstrated impact rather than predicted outcomes
- Commons-based projects can apply the impact measurement frameworks to document their contributions to shared resources and coordinate with other commons initiatives for mutual support and resource sharing

The integration of values-based coordination with practical funding mechanisms provides a replicable model for scaling regenerative approaches while maintaining integrity to underlying principles.

### Connection With SuperBenefit

- Demonstrates practical implementation of regenerative economics principles through coordinated impact measurement and alternative funding mechanisms, directly supporting SuperBenefit's work on alternatives to extractive economic systems.
- The Common Approach framework for impact measurement aligns with SuperBenefit's emphasis on systematic approaches to coordination and shared standards that enable collaboration across autonomous organizations.
- RetroQF implementation showcases innovation in public goods funding that rewards demonstrated impact rather than speculative proposals, resonating with SuperBenefit's focus on outcome-based approaches to resource allocation.
- The cross-ecosystem coordination model between ReFi DAO nodes and GreenPill chapters exemplifies the kind of distributed but coordinated organizing that SuperBenefit explores through group state primitives and cellular organizational approaches.
