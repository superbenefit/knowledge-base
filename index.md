## About This Garden

This digital garden serves as a collaborative space for exploring, documenting, and cultivating knowledge around decentralized organizations (DAOs), Web3 governance, and related social impact initiatives. It's a dynamic repository where ideas evolve from initial drafts to refined artifacts, fostering a shared understanding through community contributions and open-source principles. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for practitioners, researchers, and anyone interested in shaping the future of decentralized collaboration.
